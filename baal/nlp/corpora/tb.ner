Sir <PERSON>Richard Butler</PERSON>, 60-year-old chairman of <LOCATION>Agricola</LOCATION> (<LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION>) <LOCATION>Ltd.</LOCATION>, was named chairman of <ORGANIZATION>County NatWest Investment Management Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, the investment management subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>County NatWest Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, the investment banking arm of this British bank.
Sir <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> succeeds <PERSON>John Plastow</PERSON>, who resigned in July.
Sir <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> is also a non-executive director at <ORGANIZATION>National Westminister Bank</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NatWest Investment Bank Ltd</ORGANIZATION>.

You had to have been blind not to see the scenario there for what it was and is and will continue to be for months and even years -- a part of <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> that has sustained a blow that the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> expects will cost that organization alone some $38 million. 
The federal response to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s earthquake crisis was marred by coast-to-coast name-calling between the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Mayor Art Agnos</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Agnos</PERSON> complained that he was "ticked off" that Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>, who toured the earthquake site Wednesday, didn't schedule a private meeting with him.
The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Mr. Quayle</PERSON>'s staff had invited the mayor to two meetings of the vice president and groups of local officials and had offered to dispatch a helicopter to pick him up.
<PERSON>Mr. Agnos</PERSON> declined the invitations, the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> said. 
<PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> press secretary, also asserted that <PERSON>Mr. Agnos</PERSON> had failed to return telephone calls from <PERSON>John Sununu</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> chief of staff. "We regret very much that the mayor of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> has decided not to cooperate with us on this matter in making sure that there is adequate federal support for the disaster in his city," <PERSON>Mr. Fitzwater</PERSON> said. 
The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> announced that <PERSON>Mr. Agnos</PERSON>, along with the mayors of <ORGANIZATION>Oakland</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Alameda</LOCATION>, are to accompany President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> on a tour of the earthquake area today.
And one <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> official reported that <PERSON>Mr. Agnos</PERSON> had been "very helpful" in making arrangements for <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>'s hastily scheduled trip to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. 
British Airways dropped out of the current bidding for <ORGANIZATION>United Air</ORGANIZATION>'s parent, leaving a <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> management-pilots group without a key partner.

But the tax-preparation business simply has no more room to grow, says <PERSON>Mark Cremonie</PERSON>, director of research for <ORGANIZATION>Capital Supervisors Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> firm that manages $6.5 billion. "You go to any medium-sized town in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and you're going to see H&R Block tax services." 
To be sure, the stock still has a lot of fans. "If you invested $10,000 in the initial public offering in 1962, it would be worth well over $5 million today," says <PERSON>Fredric E.

<PERSON>Eugene Sit</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Sit Investment Associates</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, says, "When we bought it, we thought the growth rate was going to accelerate" because of computerized tax filing and instant refunds (the customer gets a refund immediately but pays extra to the tax preparer, which waits for Uncle <PERSON>Sam</PERSON>'s check). 
<PERSON>Mr. Bloch</PERSON> concedes that a recent diversification attempt fell through. "We're still interested {in diversifying}," he says, "but we'd rather be prudent than make a mistake." He also says <ORGANIZATION>CompuServe</ORGANIZATION>'s earnings continue to grow "20% to 30% a year" in spite of tough competition from giants like <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's Merkur, the company's first new car franchise in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> since the <PERSON>Edsel</PERSON> was unveiled in 1957, now will share <ORGANIZATION>Edsel</ORGANIZATION>'s fate. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said yesterday it will halt imports of the <ORGANIZATION>Merkur Scorpio</ORGANIZATION>, a $28,000 luxury sedan built by <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>.
The cars are sold under a separate franchise with its own sign in front of <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln-Mercury</ORGANIZATION> dealers -- as opposed to new models such as Taurus or Escort, which are sold under existing <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> divisions. 
The move to halt imports -- announced 29 years and 11 months to the day after <ORGANIZATION>Henry Ford</ORGANIZATION> II declared that the Edsel division and its gawky car would be scrapped -- kills the four-year-old Merkur brand in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market.
<ORGANIZATION>Merkur</ORGANIZATION>'s death isn't nearly as costly to <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> as was the Edsel debacle, because <PERSON>Merkur</PERSON> was a relatively low-budget project with limited sales goals.
Still, <ORGANIZATION>Merkur</ORGANIZATION>'s demise is a setback for <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> at a time when the company's image as the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auto maker with the golden touch is showing signs of strain. 
The No. 2 auto maker's new Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar models haven't met sales expectations in the year since they were introduced, and <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s trucks are losing ground to their <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> rivals.
This fall, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> introduced only one new product: A restyled version of its hulking <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln Town Car</ORGANIZATION> luxury model. 
The Japanese assault on the luxury market is rapidly overshadowing such European makes as <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Saab</ORGANIZATION>, which at least have clear brand images.
<ORGANIZATION>Merkur</ORGANIZATION>, as an import on domestic car lots, suffered from the same sort of image confusion that is hobbling sales of imports at <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
Merkur was originally aimed at enticing into Lincoln-Mercury dealerships the kind of young, affluent buyers who wouldn't be caught dead in a Town Car -- a vehicle so bargelike that <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> is staging a press event next month linking the Town Car's launch to the commissioning of a new aircraft carrier in <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va</LOCATION>. 
In May 1987, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> began importing the Scorpio sedan from <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> to sell next to a redesigned XR4Ti in showrooms.
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> officials said they expected the two <ORGANIZATION>Merkurs</ORGANIZATION> would sell about 15,000 cars a year, and in 1988 they reached that goal, as sales hit 15,261 cars. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Merkur</ORGANIZATION> cars also suffered from spotty quality, some dealers say. "It was like a comedy of errors," says <PERSON>Martin J.</PERSON> "Hoot" <PERSON>McInerney</PERSON>, a big dealer whose <ORGANIZATION>Star Lincoln-Mercury-Merkur</ORGANIZATION> operation in <LOCATION>Southfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, sold more XR4Ti's than any other dealership.
But by the third quarter of 1988, <ORGANIZATION>Scorpios</ORGANIZATION> had a high satisfaction rating in internal <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> studies, a spokesman said. 
Last fall, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> announced it would discontinue the XR4Ti in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> at the end of the 1989 model year.
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said then it would keep the <LOCATION>Scorpio</LOCATION>.
This year, <ORGANIZATION>Scorpio</ORGANIZATION> sales plummeted, and at the current sales pace it would take <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> 242 days to sell off the current <ORGANIZATION>Scorpio</ORGANIZATION> inventory of about 4,600 cars.

The <ORGANIZATION>House Public Works and Transportation Committee</ORGANIZATION> approved a bill that would give the <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION> power to block airline leveraged buy-outs, despite a clear veto threat from the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration. 
Transportation Secretary <PERSON>Samuel Skinner</PERSON>, in a letter to the committee, warned that he would urge President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to veto the legislation if it passed <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
On Monday, a letter from <PERSON>Mr. Skinner</PERSON>'s deputy, <PERSON>Elaine Chao</PERSON>, said the administration opposed the legislation "in its present form." Some of the bill's supporters had taken heart from the fact that the letter wasn't signed by <PERSON>Mr. Skinner</PERSON> and that it didn't contain a veto threat. 
The stepped-up administration warnings annoyed some lawmakers, especially senior Republicans who supported the bill because they thought the <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION> favored it. "We backed this bill because we thought it would help <PERSON>Skinner</PERSON>," one Republican said, "and now we're out there dangling in the wind." 
A few weeks ago, <PERSON>Mr. Skinner</PERSON> testified before <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> that it would be "cleaner, more efficient" if he had authority to block buy-outs in advance.
Under the committee bill, the <ORGANIZATION>Transportation</ORGANIZATION> secretary would have 30 days, and an additional 20 days if needed, to review any proposed purchase of 15% or more of a major <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> airline's voting stock.
"It became apparent in hearings that there ought to be regulation of leveraged buy-outs of some sort," Rep. <PERSON>James Oberstar</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Minn.</LOCATION>), chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>House Aviation Subcommittee</ORGANIZATION>, said during the panel's deliberations. "I don't believe in the airline business you can be totally laissez-faire because of the high degree of public interest" at stake. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Skinner</PERSON> disagreed, calling the legislation "a retreat from the policy of deregulaton of the airline industry." In his letter to <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Glenn Anderson</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>), the secretary also said the bill "would be at odds with the administration's policies welcoming open foreign investment and market allocation of resources." 
The panel rejected a proposal pushed by <ORGANIZATION>AMR Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, to allow the <ORGANIZATION>Transportation</ORGANIZATION> secretary to block corporate raiders from waging proxy fights to oust boards that oppose a leveraged buy-out.
<PERSON>Derek Stevens</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>British Air</ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer, told <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> Professional Investor Report a price of $230 a share is "certainly not too low," and indicated his company would like to reduce the size of its $750 million cash investment. 
<PERSON>Mr. Stevens</PERSON>'s remarks, confirming a report in The Wall Street Journal that <ORGANIZATION>British Air</ORGANIZATION> wants to start from scratch in any new bid for the nation's second-largest airline, helped push <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stock lower for the fourth straight day. 
<ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> fell $6.25 a share to $191.75 on volume of 2.3 million shares in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> as concern deepened among takeover stock traders about the length of time it will take to revive the purchase. 
Under the original buy-out approved by the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> board Sept. 14, <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>'s pilots planned to put up $200 million in cash and make $200 million in annual cost concessions for a 75% stake.
The buy-out fell through when <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Chase Manhattan Corp.</ORGANIZATION> unexpectedly failed to obtain bank financing.
The tenor of <PERSON>Mr. Stevens</PERSON>'s remarks seemed to indicate that <ORGANIZATION>British Air</ORGANIZATION> will take a more active, high-profile role in pursuing any new bid.
<PERSON>Mr. Stevens</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>British Air</ORGANIZATION> hasn't received any new buy-out proposals from the labor-management group, led by <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Stephen Wolf</PERSON>, and hasn't received any indication of when one might be forthcoming. "As far as we're concerned, we're waiting for the dust to settle," he said. 
Although <ORGANIZATION>British Air</ORGANIZATION> is waiting to see what the buy-out group comes up with, <PERSON>Mr. Stevens</PERSON> said a revised transaction with less debt leverage is likely to be more attractive to banks.
He said the original proposal is dead, and all aspects of a revised version are up for change, in light of the changes in <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>'s market price, the amount of debt banks are willing to fund, and the price <ORGANIZATION>British Air</ORGANIZATION> would be willing to pay. 
A pilot representing a group of 220 pilots hired during <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION>'s 1985 strike filed suit Friday in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> federal court to block the takeover.
<ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>'s management agreed to reduce the seniority of those pilots in exchange for the support of the <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> pilot union for the buy-out proposal.
That unit of its <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Kaolin Co.</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary was sold to a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Unimin Corp</ORGANIZATION>.

Some delays have been caused by a shortage of micoprocessors -- notably <ORGANIZATION>Intel Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's newest chip, the 486 -- but others apparently have been caused by <ORGANIZATION>Dell</ORGANIZATION>'s explosive growth and thinly stretched resources. 
"They've got a lot of different balls in the air at the same time," observes <PERSON>Jim Poyner</PERSON>, a computer securities analyst with Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION>William K. Woodruff & Co</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Dell</PERSON>, meanwhile, concedes the company was "definitely too optimistic" in its expectations. 
Product delays, however, have left <ORGANIZATION>Dell</ORGANIZATION> buffeted by harsher competition in its bread-and-butter line of desktop computers, as powerhouse competitors <ORGANIZATION>Compaq Computer Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION> price their PCs more aggressively.
Analyst <PERSON>James Weil</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Soundview Financial Group</ORGANIZATION> believes <ORGANIZATION>Dell</ORGANIZATION>'s response has been to place increased emphasis on product quality, "in an effort to rise above some of that price pressure." But that has been the key to <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION>'s success, he adds, whereas <ORGANIZATION>Dell</ORGANIZATION> carved out its market niche as a direct seller of low-cost but reliable computers -- and it might be too late in the game for a shift in strategy. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Board of Trade</ORGANIZATION>, the No. 1 <ORGANIZATION>U. S.</ORGANIZATION> grain market, had long chafed under the attention won by its innovative archrival, the livestock-dealing <ORGANIZATION>Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION>.
After four year of tinkering and $2.4 million in seed money, the board set up the new marketplace, titled it the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Board Options Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, and named <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> its first president. 
The <ORGANIZATION>CBOE</ORGANIZATION> opened for business on April 26, 1973, in what had been a <ORGANIZATION>Board of Trade</ORGANIZATION> lunchroom.
Last year, more than 1,800 traders on the <ORGANIZATION>CBOE</ORGANIZATION> bought and sold 112 million contracts on 178 listed stocks, 60% of all <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> listed options trading. 
<PERSON>John Uphoff</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Raymond James & Associates</ORGANIZATION>, said the results weren't surprising, and attributed the buy-back to management's confidence in the Mirage's ability to generate strong cash flow in 1990.
Yesterday, in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>Golden Nugget</ORGANIZATION> common closed at $28.25, up $2. 
<ORGANIZATION>Schlumberger Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, reported third-quarter net income edged up as growth in its oil-field services sector offset a decline in interest income. 
<ORGANIZATION>W.R. Grace & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said its earnings for the third quarter nearly doubled as a result of a $114.4 million pre-tax gain from restructuring its energy operations and other adjustments. 
The gain resulted from the sale of <ORGANIZATION>Grace Equipment Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the initial public offering of a one-sixth interest in <ORGANIZATION>Grace Energy Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and an adjustment in the carrying value of certain natural resource assets not part of <ORGANIZATION>Grace Energy</ORGANIZATION>. 
Three savings-and-loan institutions in <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> were added to the <ORGANIZATION>Resolution Trust Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's conservatorship program after federal regulators declared the thrifts insolvent and named the <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION> their receiver. 
The three institutions are: Mid <ORGANIZATION>Kansas Federal Savings & Loan Association</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Wichita</ORGANIZATION>, which had $830.5 million in assets; <ORGANIZATION>Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association of McAllen</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>McAllen</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, with $582.6 million in assets; and <ORGANIZATION>Surety Savings Association</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>El Paso</LOCATION>, with $309.3 million in assets. 
Separately, <ORGANIZATION>Century Bank</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, was closed by <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> banking officials.
The <ORGANIZATION>Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</ORGANIZATION> approved the assumption of <ORGANIZATION>Century</ORGANIZATION>'s deposits and fully secured liabilities by a newly chartered subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Valley Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it decided to proceed with installation of automatic gauge and shape controls at its 60-inch tandem cold rolling mill in <LOCATION>Allenport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa</LOCATION>. 
Strict new regulations seem certain to pass the state <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> next week, with easy approval by the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and by Democratic Gov. <PERSON>Bob Casey</PERSON> expected shortly thereafter.
Legislation to require the consent of parents before their daughters under the age of 18 can have abortions will probably pass both houses of the <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> legislature and set up a grinding battle to override the expected veto of Democratic Gov. <PERSON>James Blanchard</PERSON>. 
The action in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, for example, will follow last week's collapse of a special session of the <ORGANIZATION>Florida legislature</ORGANIZATION> to enact restrictions on abortions in that state, and the vote here in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> to permit federally paid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest.
But President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is expected to veto the congressional legislation and that, along with the easy approval of the <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> measure, is likely to mute the abortion-rights activists' claims of momentum and underline the challenges faced by this resurgent movement. 
"It's great to feel good for once in 15 years," says <PERSON>Harrison Hickman</PERSON>, a consultant to abortion-rights advocates, reflecting the relief of his compatriots after last week's victories, the first major events since the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>, in its July 3 Webster decision, permitted the states to enact restrictions on abortions. "But how many more times we're going to feel good in the next 15 is another question." 
Indeed, abortion-rights activists still face their greatest tests. "The pro-choice movement has shown -- finally -- that it can mobilize," says <PERSON>Glen Halva-Neubauer</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Furman University</ORGANIZATION> political scientist who specializes in how state legislators handle the abortion question. "But it still hasn't shown that it can win in a state like <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, where abortion has been clearly an electoral issue and where it's been an emotional issue for a long time." 
As a result, <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> state Rep. <PERSON>Stephen Freind</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Delaware County</LOCATION>, the legislature's leading foe of abortion, has been given all but free rein to press a strict seven-point plan to restrict abortion and, he hopes, to force the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> directly to reassess its 1973 <PERSON>Roe</PERSON> v.
The Freind legislation -- the state's <ORGANIZATION>House Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> approved it in <LOCATION>Harrisburg</LOCATION> this week and the full <ORGANIZATION>Pennsylvania House</ORGANIZATION> is expected to take up the bill next Tuesday -- includes a provision to ban abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy, except to avert the death of the mother.
<PERSON>Mr. Freind</PERSON> calculates that the provision, which attacks the trimester standards that <PERSON>Roe</PERSON> established, will "make it necessary" for the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> to review <PERSON>Roe</PERSON> and, perhaps, to overturn it. 
In <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, where the state <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> is expected to approve parental-consent legislation by the end of next week, Gov. <PERSON>Blanchard</PERSON> is the principal obstacle for anti-abortionists.
<PERSON>Susan Rogin</PERSON>, a consultant to abortion-rights activists in the state, takes comfort from the fact that the state's <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> abortion opponents "haven't been able to muster the votes to overturn a veto on abortion in 16 years." But proponents believe they may be able to shake enough votes loose to override the veto if they are successful in portraying the legislation as a matter of parents' rights. 
<PERSON>Pamela Sutherland</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Illinois Planned Parenthood Council</ORGANIZATION>, says she and her allies are "cautiously optimistic" they can defeat it if it comes to a floor vote. 
"The prognosis is only fair," says <PERSON>Kathie Roberts</PERSON>, administrative director of the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Right to Life Committee</ORGANIZATION>. "Next year is an election year and the legislators just don't want to do anything about this now." 
This legislative activity comes as both sides are undertaking new mobilization efforts, plunging into gubernatorial races in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, and girding for next autumn's state elections. 
At the same time, abortion foes have developed a national legislative strategy, deciding to move on what <PERSON>Jacki Ragan</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Right to Life Committee</ORGANIZATION>'s director of state organizational development, calls "reasonable measures that an overwhelming mainstream majority of <LOCATION>Americans</LOCATION> support." These include bans on the use of abortion for birth control and sex selection, and the public funding of alternatives for abortion. "Those who are on the other side can hardly oppose alternative funding if they continue to insist on calling themselves 'pro-choice' rather than `pro-abortion, '" says <PERSON>Mary Spaulding</PERSON>, the group's associate state legislative coordinator. 
Over the weekend, the <ORGANIZATION>National Abortion Rights Action League</ORGANIZATION> singled out eight politicians, including <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Freind</PERSON>, as 1990 targets and held a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> seminar designed to train its leaders in political techniques, including how to put the anti-abortionists on the defensive in state legislatures. "We now see pro-choice legislators going on the offensive for the first time," says <PERSON>Kate Michelman</PERSON>, executive director of the group. 
Sebastian <PERSON>Guzman Cabrera</PERSON> took over the oil workers union, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s most powerful labor organization, only last January.
But even in that short time <PERSON>Mr. Guzman Cabrera</PERSON> has become as controversial in his own way as his deposed predecessor, <PERSON>Joaquin Hernandez Galicia</PERSON>, known as <LOCATION>La Quina</LOCATION>. 
President <PERSON>Carlos Salinas de Gortari</PERSON> used the army to oust <LOCATION>La Quina</LOCATION>, who reigned for 28 years over a graft-riddled empire that made state-run <PERSON>Petroleos Mexicanos</PERSON>, or <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION>, one of the world's most inefficient oil companies.
Now, <PERSON>Mr. Guzman Cabrera</PERSON> is facing accusations that he's as much a company man as <ORGANIZATION>La Quina</ORGANIZATION> was a crook. 
In recent contract negotiations with <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION> management, <PERSON>Mr. Guzman Cabrera</PERSON> accepted major concessions that greatly curtail the union's role in subcontracting, long a source of millions of dollars in illicit earnings.
And with the quiet pragmatism of <PERSON>Mr. Guzman Cabrera</PERSON> replacing the prickly populism of <LOCATION>La Quina</LOCATION>, government technocrats have been given a free hand to open the petrochemical sector to wider private and foreign investment. 
Leftist leader <ORGANIZATION>Cuauhtemoc Cardenas</ORGANIZATION> publicly questioned <PERSON>Mr. Guzman Cabrera</PERSON>'s "moral quality," suggesting he is part of a conspiracy to turn over the country's oil, a symbol of <LOCATION>Mexican</LOCATION> nationalism, to foreigners. 
The 61-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Guzman Cabrera</PERSON> takes such criticisms in stride. "This isn't a new kind of union leadership, it's a new <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
Since world oil prices collapsed in 1982, the government has siphoned <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION>'s coffers to make payments on <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s $97 billion foreign debt.
Some projections show <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> importing crude by the end of the century, barring an overhaul of operations. "Whatever you tried to change, whether it was cutting costs or attracting new partners, the big obstacle was the old union leadership," says oil consultant <PERSON>George Baker</PERSON>. 
Enter <PERSON>Mr. Guzman Cabrera</PERSON>, who has a clear understanding of where union leaders fit in the pro-enterprise regime of President <PERSON>Salinas</PERSON>. "I'm the secretary-general, if there is one," he says, greeting a visitor to his office.
Beginning as a laborer in a refinery, <PERSON>Mr. Guzman Cabrera</PERSON> put in more than 40 years at <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION> before being pushed into retirement by <ORGANIZATION>La Quina</ORGANIZATION> after a dispute two years ago. 
Though he also long benefited from the system built by <ORGANIZATION>La Quina</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Guzman Cabrera</PERSON> says union perks had simply gotten out of hand.
Thus, in recent contract negotiations, <PERSON>Mr. Guzman Cabrera</PERSON> gave up the union's right to assign 40% of all of <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION>'s outside contracts -- an enormous source of kickbacks.
But Pemex managers are the ones most thrilled by the contract. "We are retaking the instruments of administration," says <PERSON>Raul Robles</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Pemex</LOCATION> subdirector.
<PERSON>Grupo Desc</PERSON>, a big conglomerate, has long depended on <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION> petrochemicals to produce plastic packing material.
But when the <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION> plant shut down for an annual overhaul, it would never give notice to its customers. "The capriciousness would completely disrupt our operations," says <PERSON>Ernesto Vega Velasco</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Desc</ORGANIZATION>'s finance director.
But <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION>'s courtship with private companies, and especially foreign ones, is controversial in a country where oil has been a symbol of national sovereignty since foreign oil holdings were nationalized in 1938. "They are preparing the workers for what's coming: foreign control," wrote <PERSON>Heberto Castillo</PERSON>, a leftist leader. 
<ORGANIZATION>Aussedat Rey S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, a French paper producer, said it concluded an agreement with <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Fuji Photo Film Co.</ORGANIZATION> that will allow <ORGANIZATION>Aussedat Rey</ORGANIZATION> to manufacture and sell thermal paper using <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION> technology. 
The Canadian government introduced in the <ORGANIZATION>House of Commons</ORGANIZATION> legislation to extend federal regulatory authority over provincial government-owned telephone utilities in <LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Saskatchewan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Manitoba</LOCATION>. 
The federal government initiative follows a recent <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> decision that held that the major telephone companies in <LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Saskatchewan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Manitoba</LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> coast provinces were interprovincial undertakings and subject to federal legislative authority.
Prior to the ruling the federal government had regulated only the telephone companies in <LOCATION>Quebec</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>British Columbia</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Northwest Territories</ORGANIZATION>. 
The governments of <LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Saskatchewan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Manitoba</LOCATION> have strongly opposed federal regulation of their telephone companies.
<ORGANIZATION>First Fidelity Bancorp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Lawrenceville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, reported a 24% drop in third-quarter profit, because of a decline in earning assets, lower loan volume and tighter interest margins.

<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> said the question of <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>'s membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade should be considered only after <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s own membership in the 97-nation organization is restored. 
Both <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> are seeking seats in <ORGANIZATION>GATT</ORGANIZATION>, which sponsors trade-liberalizing agreements and sets world-commerce rules. "As one of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s provinces, <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> has no right to join <ORGANIZATION>GATT</ORGANIZATION> on its own," <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Li Zhaoxing</PERSON> said. 
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, under the Nationalist government of <PERSON>Chiang Kai-shek</PERSON>, was a founding member of <ORGANIZATION>GATT</ORGANIZATION> in 1947.
The Nationalists withdrew in 1950, after their flight to <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>, and the Communist government in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> applied for restoration of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s membership in July 1986. 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> has voiced opposition to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s bid for <ORGANIZATION>GATT</ORGANIZATION> membership, saying <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has yet to undertake needed economic reforms. 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s biggest women's underwear maker, <ORGANIZATION>Wacoal Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said that it developed a sports car that it plans to market in two years.
Along with the car, <PERSON>Wacoal</PERSON> plans to launch a series of Caspita-brand men's underwear. "Our image is a company that makes women's products," said a <LOCATION>Wacoal</LOCATION> spokesman. "Now, we're going to sell to men." 
<ORGANIZATION>Senshukai Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a travel agent based in <LOCATION>Osaka</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, announced that it and <ORGANIZATION>Nissho Iwai Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a major Japanese trading house, will jointly build a 130-unit condominium in <LOCATION>Queensland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Senshukai</PERSON> has a 60% stake in the venture and <ORGANIZATION>Nissho Iwai</ORGANIZATION> has the rest.
<PERSON>Viktor Sidorenko</PERSON>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>State Committee</ORGANIZATION> on Nuclear Safety, said the two reactors were at Kursk and Smolensk.
News of the halt comes amid growing anger in the <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Byelorussia</LOCATION> over continuing high levels of radiation from <LOCATION>Chernobyl</LOCATION>. 
A former vice president of the <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> branch of <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> was charged in court yesterday on 19 counts of cheating.
<PERSON>Francis Dang</PERSON>, 41, is alleged to have been involved in cheating <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert</ORGANIZATION> of up to 2.1 million <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> dollars (US$1.1 million) by carrying out unauthorized transactions on the <ORGANIZATION>London Commodities Exchange</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>International Petroleum Exchange</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Dang</PERSON> is alleged to have used the account of <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> hotel and property magnate Ong Beng Seng to effect the transactions. 
A <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of International Trade and Industry</ORGANIZATION> official said that a study found that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s annual economic growth rate would eventually be only 0.8% if carbon-dioxide emissions remained at this year's level of 300 million tons.
Just in time for <ORGANIZATION>Halloween</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Oxford University Press</ORGANIZATION> is publishing a "Dictionary of Superstitions." The books 1,500 entries include stepping on cracks and knocking on wood. . . . In <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>'s tiny township of <LOCATION>Kaitaia</LOCATION>, which has had direct dialing for less than a year, about 30 angry phone-company customers questioned the size of their bills.
The <ORGANIZATION>Nuclear Regulatory Commission</ORGANIZATION> ruled unanimously that the financial troubles facing the <LOCATION>Seabrook</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.H.</LOCATION>, nuclear-power plant have no impact on whether the plant receives a full-power license. 
<LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON>James Shannon</PERSON>, opposing the license, said he will appeal the ruling in <ORGANIZATION>federal court</ORGANIZATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>NRC</ORGANIZATION> rejected <PERSON>Mr. Shannon</PERSON>'s argument that <ORGANIZATION>Public Service Co. of New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION>, which owns the largest share of <LOCATION>Seabrook</LOCATION>, and 11 other owners are financially unable to guarantee the plant's safe operation.
<PERSON>Mr. Shannon</PERSON> was seeking a waiver of <ORGANIZATION>NRC</ORGANIZATION> policy that ignores financial considerations in making licensing decisions. 
In its ruling, the <ORGANIZATION>NRC</ORGANIZATION> said that because <PERSON>Seabrook</PERSON> will be allowed to charge rates sufficient to run the plant and make payments on past construction costs, consideration of the owners' financial condition is pointless. 
That level is about the same as some other big banks, but far below the 85% and 100% reserves of <ORGANIZATION>Bankers Trust New York Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>J.P. Morgan & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, respectively. 
By that key measure of operating efficiency, <ORGANIZATION>BankAmerica</ORGANIZATION> turned in a better performance than its well-regarded Los Angeles-based competitor, <ORGANIZATION>Security Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which posted a 0.89% return in the third quarter.
But it continued to badly trail its <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> neighbor, <ORGANIZATION>Wells Fargo & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which reported an extraordinary 1.25% return on assets.
"They {<ORGANIZATION>BankAmerica</ORGANIZATION>} continue to show good performance," said <PERSON>Donald K. Crowley</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
In composite trading yesterday on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>BankAmerica</ORGANIZATION> common stock edged up 12.5 cents to close at $32 a share. 
<ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION>, which has agreed with <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to merge their cellular-telephone businesses, said then that it wouldn't take a position on <ORGANIZATION>McCaw</ORGANIZATION>'s revised tender offer. 
Earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION>McCaw</ORGANIZATION> revised its offer to $125 a share for 22 million <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> shares.
In a statement, <PERSON>Craig O. McCaw</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <PERSON>McCaw</PERSON>, said: "We trust <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> will take no further actions that favor <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth</ORGANIZATION>." 
<ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> would have a priority right to pursue all opportunities to acquire <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> cellular interests in markets other than those in which McCaw holds an interest, or which are contiguous to those markets, unless <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> has an interest there or contiguous to it.
<ORGANIZATION>Eagle Pencil of Shelbyville</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, "<ORGANIZATION>Pencil City U.S.A.</ORGANIZATION>," had made its earliest pilot plastic pencils in 1971.
But it wasn't until after it hired <PERSON>Arthur D. Little</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, research concern, that its new product was refined for commercial sale in 1973.
Three A.D.L. inventors applied April 6, 1973, for the patent, which was assigned and awarded in 1976 to <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro Industries</ORGANIZATION>, then <ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION>'s parent. 
Eagle, now called <ORGANIZATION>Eagle-Berol</ORGANIZATION>, remains a leading company among the 10 in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> that produced about 2.3 billion pencils last year, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Pencil Makers Association</ORGANIZATION>.
As former <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>William McChesney Martin</PERSON> used to say, they would have to take the punch bowl away just as the party is getting interesting. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> is easily assigned the blame for unpleasantness, like high interest rates or slow economic growth, while the politicians can escape responsibility by pointing to the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>'s independence. 
This leads to proposals for "reform" of the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>, which have the common feature of making the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> more responsive to the administration, to the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and to public opinion -- without, however, any assumption of additional responsibility by the politicians.
These proposals include changing the term of the chairman, shortening the terms of the members, eliminating the presidents of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Banks</ORGANIZATION> from the decision-making process, putting the Secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Board</ORGANIZATION>, having the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> audited by an arm of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> (the <ORGANIZATION>General Accounting Office</ORGANIZATION>), putting the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>'s expenditures in the budget, and requiring prompt publication of the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>'s minutes.
Putting the Secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Governors</ORGANIZATION>, one of the leading proposals today, is an example.
(True, a succession of <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> chairmen has given color to the notion that the Secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> belongs on the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>.
By their constant readiness to advise all and sundry about federal budgetary matters the chairmen have encouraged the belief that fiscal policy and monetary policy are ingredients of a common stew, in which case it is natural that the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>, and probably also the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, should be jointly engaged in stirring the pot.
The <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> exercises a power given to it by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and the president.
But <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and the president accept no responsibility for the exercise of the power they have given the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>. 
The greatest contribution <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> could make at this time would be to declare that stabilizing the price level is the primary responsibility of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve System</ORGANIZATION>.
Legislation to this effect has been introduced in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in this session by Rep. <PERSON>Stephen Neal</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>).
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> would be required to make a hard decision, and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> would much prefer to leave the hard decision to the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> and retain its rights of complaint after the fact. 
A former chairman of the president's <ORGANIZATION>Council of Economic Advisers</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Stein</PERSON> is an <ORGANIZATION>American Enterprise Institute</ORGANIZATION> fellow. 
<ORGANIZATION>Lonrho PLC</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> is to come to the rescue of the French distribution group <ORGANIZATION>Societe Commerciale de l'Ouest Africaine</ORGANIZATION> in an operation that has been engineered with the <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> financial group, <ORGANIZATION>Societe Commerciale</ORGANIZATION>'s main shareholder. 
This will give <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> and Lonrho joint control of <ORGANIZATION>Societe Commerciale</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> said Lonrho will participate in the forthcoming capital boost for <ORGANIZATION>Societe Commerciale</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Michael F. Harris</PERSON>, 53, was named executive vice president, <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, for the <ORGANIZATION>Financial Times</ORGANIZATION>, the business newspaper published by this company that also has interests in book publishing, fine china, oil services and investment banking.
<PERSON>Mr. Harris</PERSON> had been vice president for the newspaper's advertising in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
He takes additional responsibility for newspaper sales and distribution of the <ORGANIZATION>Financial Times</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Laurance V. Allen</PERSON>, 44, who had been director for <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, resigned to pursue other business interests and do some consulting. 
In the year earlier period, the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> parent of <ORGANIZATION>Republic National Bank</ORGANIZATION> had net income of $38.7 million, or $1.12 a share.
The company said <PERSON>Mr. Franco</PERSON> developed a plan to establish a business that might be competitive with <ORGANIZATION>Capital Holding Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's Accumulation and <ORGANIZATION>Investment Group</ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON>Mr. Franco</PERSON> headed.
The group temporarily will report to <PERSON>Irving W. Bailey II</PERSON>, chairman, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Capital Holding</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Martin H. Ruby</PERSON>, a managing director of <ORGANIZATION>Capital Holding's Accumulation and Investment Group</ORGANIZATION>, also resigned to pursue other business interests, <ORGANIZATION>Capital Holding</ORGANIZATION> said. 
<PERSON>Mr. Ruby</PERSON>, 39, said that he had "an amicable parting" with <ORGANIZATION>Capital Holding</ORGANIZATION> and that he has "a number of ventures in the financial-services area" under consideration.
In composite <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange Trading</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> stock rose $1.25 a share yesterday to close at $58. 
The <LOCATION>Deerfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, medical products and services company posted net of $102 million, or 34 cents a share, compared with $85 million, or 28 cents a share, a year ago.
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <PERSON>Baxter</PERSON> closed at $22.25 a share, down 12.5 cents. 
In an unusual display of openness, <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> also will be helping customers tie together operations that include lots of equipment made by <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>'s competitors. 
In <LOCATION>Armonk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, an <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman confirmed that <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> executives will be announcing some computer-integrated-manufacturing plans next week but declined to elaborate. 
"This is a step in the right direction," said <PERSON>Martin Piszczalski</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Yankee Group</ORGANIZATION> analyst.
The announcements also should help <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> go on the offensive against <ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment Corp.</ORGANIZATION> on the plant floor.
While <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> has traditionally dominated the market for computers on the business side of manufacturing operations and has done well in the market for design tools, <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION> has dominated computerized manufacturing.
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> will face an uphill climb against <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION>, given <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION>'s reputation for being better than <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> at hooking together different manufacturers' computers.
In addition, <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard</ORGANIZATION>, while a much smaller player, has made a big commitment to the sorts of industry standards that facilitate those hookups and could give <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> some problems.
Both can be expected to go after the market aggressively: <ORGANIZATION>Gartner Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a research firm, estimated the <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION> gets 30% of its revenue from the manufacturing market, and <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard</ORGANIZATION> gets 50%. 
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION>Gartner Group</ORGANIZATION> said generates 22% of its revenue in this market, should be able to take advantage of its loyal following among buyers of equipment.
The whole idea of computer-integrated manufacturing, <ORGANIZATION>CIM</ORGANIZATION>, seems to be making a comeback after losing a little luster over the past couple of years when it became apparent that it wasn't a panacea that would make <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> plants more efficient and banish foreign competition. 
<PERSON>Erik Keller</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Gartner Group</ORGANIZATION> analyst, said organizational changes may still be required to really take advantage of <ORGANIZATION>CIM</ORGANIZATION>'s capabilities -- someone on the shop floor may not like having someone in an office using a personal computer to look over his shoulder, for instance, and may be able to prevent that from happening.
Swedish auto and aerospace concern <ORGANIZATION>Saab-Scania AB</ORGANIZATION> said it received a 250 million krona ($39 million) order from Swiss Crossair, one of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s leading regional air companies, for five <LOCATION>Saab</LOCATION> 340B turboprop commuter aircraft. 
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> formed <ORGANIZATION>Discovision</ORGANIZATION> in 1979 to make laser-read optical products.
<PERSON>James N. Fiedler</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Discovision</ORGANIZATION> and a vice president of <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION>, said that <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> hadn't planned to sell the joint venture, which is now profitable, but that <ORGANIZATION>Pioneer</ORGANIZATION> approached <ORGANIZATION>Discovision</ORGANIZATION> earlier this year.
He said it isn't certain whether <ORGANIZATION>Discovision</ORGANIZATION>'s current management will remain when <LOCATION>Pioneer</LOCATION> buys the company. 
<ORGANIZATION>Canadian Pacific Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> said it proposed acquiring the 44% of <ORGANIZATION>Soo Line Corp.</ORGANIZATION> it doesn't already own for $19.50 a share, or about $81.9 million, after failing to find a buyer for its majority stake earlier this year. 
The proposed acquisition will be subject to approval by the <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Soo Line</PERSON> said. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Soo Line</ORGANIZATION> shares jumped well above the proposed price, closing at $20.25, up $2.75. 
<ORGANIZATION>Canadian Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, which has interests in transportation, telecommunications, forest products, energy and real estate, finally took its majority block off the market this spring. "It turned out we couldn't sell it," a <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Pacific</ORGANIZATION> official said, adding that acquiring the remainder of <PERSON>Soo Line</PERSON> is now "the best way to rationalize operations." 
<LOCATION>Canadian Pacific</LOCATION> is <LOCATION>Soo Line</LOCATION>'s biggest customer and has owned a majority stake in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> railroad since 1947.
<LOCATION>Canadian Pacific</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Soo Line</ORGANIZATION> tracks connect at two points in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> on the Canada-U.S. border and the two companies operate a very successful Chicago-Montreal rail service. 
NEW <LOCATION>ENGLAND</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>CRITICAL CARE Inc.</ORGANIZATION> offered $35 million in convertible subordinated debentures through <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Capital Funding</ORGANIZATION>.
The debentures may be converted into common stock of the <LOCATION>Westborough</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, home health care concern at $52.50 a share.
<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> stocks, which rebounded strongly Tuesday, extended their gains yesterday, but most other <LOCATION>Asian</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> markets closed sharply lower. 
In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Financial Times-Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> 100-share index jumped 34.6 points to close at its intraday high of 2170.1.
The index was under pressure for most of the morning over concerns that the effects of Tuesday night's major earthquake in the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> area would undermine the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market.
<LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> composite, or non-life, insurers, which some equity analysts said might be heavily hit by the earthquake disaster, helped support the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> market by showing only narrow losses in early trading.
The insurers' relative resilience gave the market time to reappraise the impact of the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> disaster on <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> equities, dealers said. 
Among composite insurers, General Accident rose 10 pence to #10.03 ($15.80) a share, <ORGANIZATION>Guardian Royal</ORGANIZATION> climbed 5 to 217 pence, <ORGANIZATION>Sun Alliance</ORGANIZATION> rose 3 to 290, and <ORGANIZATION>Royal Insurance</ORGANIZATION> jumped 12 to 450.
Life insurers fared similarly, with <ORGANIZATION>Legal & General</ORGANIZATION> advancing 3 to 344, although <ORGANIZATION>Prudential</ORGANIZATION> fell 2 to 184 1/2.
<ORGANIZATION>Pearl Group</ORGANIZATION> rose 5 to 628, and <ORGANIZATION>Sun Life</ORGANIZATION> finished unchanged at #10.98. 
Most banking issues retreated after a sector downgrade by <ORGANIZATION>Warburg Securities</ORGANIZATION>, although <ORGANIZATION>National Westminister</ORGANIZATION> showed strength on positive comments from brokerage firms about its long-term prospects.
The session is to consider a defensive plan to spin off assets to fend off Sir <PERSON>James Goldsmith</PERSON>'s #13.4 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION>B.A.T.</ORGANIZATION> 
Trading was suspended in <ORGANIZATION>WCRS Group</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> advertising concern, pending an announcement that it is buying the remaining 50% of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s Carat Holding for 2.02 billion French francs ($318.7 million) and expanding commercial and equity ties with advertising group <ORGANIZATION>Eurocom</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> advanced 19 to 673 as traders contemplated a potential battle between <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor</ORGANIZATION> for control of the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> luxury auto maker. 
<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Nikkei</ORGANIZATION> index of 225 issues rose 111.48 points, or 0.32%, to 35107.56.
In early trading in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION>Nikkei</ORGANIZATION> index rose 135.09 points to 35242.65. 
Traders and analysts said they didn't see any effect on <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> stocks from the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> earthquake.
<ORGANIZATION>Kirin Brewery</ORGANIZATION> was up 100 at 2,000, and <ORGANIZATION>Ajinomoto</ORGANIZATION> gained 70 to 2,840.
Shares closed lower in other major <LOCATION>Asian</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> markets, including <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>.
Elsewhere, prices surged for a second day in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, closed higher in <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION> and were broadly lower in <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>.
Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION>.
But <ORGANIZATION>Pfizer Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, reported flat earnings. 
<ORGANIZATION>Schering-Plough Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Madison</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, reported a 21% rise in earnings as <ORGANIZATION>American Home Products Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> posted an 11% increase in net. 
<ORGANIZATION>American Home Products</ORGANIZATION> said net income benefited from a "lower effective tax rate," reflecting a reduction of foreign tax rates, and additional operations in <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>.
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>American Home Products</ORGANIZATION> closed at $102.25 a share, down 75 cents. 
During the quarter, <PERSON>Pfizer</PERSON> received federal approval of <ORGANIZATION>Procardia XL</ORGANIZATION>, a calcium channel blocker approved for both angina and hypertension, and <PERSON>Monorail Piccolino</PERSON>, used to open obstructed coronary arteries.

<ORGANIZATION>Colorado National</ORGANIZATION> is a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Colorado National Bankshares Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Central</LOCATION> is a unit of <ORGANIZATION>First Bank System of Minneapolis</ORGANIZATION>. 
Outside the white-walled headquarters of the socalled <ORGANIZATION>Society of Orange Workers</ORGANIZATION>, all seems normal in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s abnormal society. 
But inside the white walls of the <ORGANIZATION>Orange Workers</ORGANIZATION>' office -- just about the largest building in town, save for the <ORGANIZATION>Dutch Reformed Church</ORGANIZATION> and the school -- <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s neat racial order is awry.
"If we want to have our own nation, then we must be willing to do all the work ourselves," says <PERSON>Hendrik Verwoerd Jr.</PERSON>, son of the former prime minister and the leader of the <ORGANIZATION>Orange Workers</ORGANIZATION>, founded in 1980. 
The pillars of apartheid may be trembling in the rest of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, with <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION> opening its public facilities to all races, blacks storming the all-white beaches of the <LOCATION>Cape</LOCATION> and the government releasing seven leaders of the banned <ORGANIZATION>African National Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
But here in <LOCATION>Morgenzon</LOCATION>, a sleepy town amid the corn fields of the eastern <ORGANIZATION>Transvaal</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Orange Workers</ORGANIZATION> are holding the pillars steady. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Orange Workers</ORGANIZATION> -- who take their name from <PERSON>William of Orange</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, a hero of the Dutch-descended Afrikaners -- believe that the solution to <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s racial problems isn't the abolition of apartheid, it's the perfection of apartheid -- complete and total separation of the races. 
In their quest to perfect apartheid, the <ORGANIZATION>Orange Workers</ORGANIZATION> have discovered a truth that most of privileged white <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> tries mightily to deny: The master can't become dependent on the slave and expect to remain master forever. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Orange Workers</ORGANIZATION> speak sincerely. "We agree with world opinion that the status quo in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> is morally wrong," says <PERSON>Pieter Bruwer</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Orange Workers</ORGANIZATION>' chief scribe and pamphleteer. "We must either integrate honestly or segregate honestly." 
<PERSON>Morgenzon</PERSON> has long been a special domain of <LOCATION>Afrikanerdom</LOCATION>.
According to <PERSON>Mr. Verwoerd</PERSON>, the early Afrikaner pioneers were the first people to settle in the eastern <ORGANIZATION>Transvaal</ORGANIZATION>, even before the blacks.
It was an ideal place for the <ORGANIZATION>Orange Workers</ORGANIZATION> to start their new nation, unencumbered by the demographics that have undermined apartheid elsewhere in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. 
Over at the <ORGANIZATION>Shell</ORGANIZATION> station, owner <PERSON>Rudi van Dyk</PERSON>, who doubles as <PERSON>Morgenzon</PERSON>'s mayor, worries that the <ORGANIZATION>Orange Workers</ORGANIZATION> have made his town the laughingstock of the nation. "What they want us to do just isn't practical," he says, noting that he employs 16 blacks. "I couldn't afford to hire 16 whites.
Back at the <LOCATION>Verwoerd</LOCATION> house, <PERSON>Hendrik Sr.</PERSON> peers down over the shoulder of <PERSON>Hendrik Jr</PERSON>.
The son believes that when the Afrikaners finally realize there is no turning back the integration of <LOCATION>South African</LOCATION> society and politics, <PERSON>Morgenzon</PERSON> will boom. 
"We urge our people not to wait until they have to fight for their own nation," says <PERSON>Mr. Verwoerd</PERSON>. "By populating a place now, we make ourselves a power any new government will have to take into account." Curiously, he compares the <ORGANIZATION>Orange Workers</ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION>, which his father outlawed in 1960. "The <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> won't be stopped until there is a provision for black aspirations," says <PERSON>Mr. Verwoerd</PERSON>. "Likewise, no government will stop this idea of the Afrikaners." 
In addition, <PERSON>Michael W. O'Donnell</PERSON>, executive vice president of a <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> unit, was named assistant chief financial officer and a senior vice president of the parent company.
A group bidding for <ORGANIZATION>American Medical International Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said it formally received the final financing needed for a $3 billion bid for about 86% of the hospital operator's stock. 
Earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION>IMA</ORGANIZATION> said it had received about $1 billion of senior debt financing from <ORGANIZATION>Chemical Bank</ORGANIZATION> and six other banks; <ORGANIZATION>Chemical Bank</ORGANIZATION> said it was "highly confident" it could arrange the balance of about $509 million. 
In addition, the $3 billion bid includes $1 billion of debt that will be assumed by <ORGANIZATION>IMA</ORGANIZATION>, $600 million of high-yield junk bonds that will be sold by <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and $285 million of equity. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>American Medical</ORGANIZATION> closed at $23.625, up $1.875. 
<ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Montgomery Securities Inc.</ORGANIZATION> are co-managing the offering. 
The parent company's net included a loss -- which it didn't specify -- that was related to the company's 50% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Cineplex Odeon Corp</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Cineplex</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> theater chain, had a second-quarter net loss of $38.7 million. 
<ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> said net also included certain reserves related to the restructuring of its <ORGANIZATION>LJN Toys</ORGANIZATION>' international operations.
These items were partly offset, <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> said, by an unspecified gain on the sale of its <ORGANIZATION>Miller International</ORGANIZATION> unit, a maker and distributor of budget-priced audio cassettes. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> rose $1.50 to $64. 
<ORGANIZATION>H.F. Ahmanson & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest thrift holding company, posted a 12% earnings decline for the third quarter while another large <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> savings and loan, <ORGANIZATION>Great Western Financial Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, reported a slight earnings gain. 
<ORGANIZATION>H.F. Ahmanson</ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION>Home Savings of America</ORGANIZATION>, reported third-quarter net of $49.2 million, or 50 cents a share, down from $56.1 million, or 57 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. 
<LOCATION>Great Western</LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, is a financial services firm and parent to <ORGANIZATION>Great Western Bank</ORGANIZATION>, an S&L. 
<ORGANIZATION>Helmsley Enterprises Inc.</ORGANIZATION> plans to close its company-owned insurance business and is seeking other brokers to take over its policies, according to individuals familiar with the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> firm. 
<ORGANIZATION>Helmsley Enterprises</ORGANIZATION> is the umbrella organization for companies controlled by <PERSON>Harry B. Helmsley</PERSON>.
These include office and residential real estate giant, <ORGANIZATION>HelmsleySpear Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Helmsley Hotels</ORGANIZATION>.
The insurance brokerage agency, just a fragment of <PERSON>Helmsley</PERSON>'s vast empire, would be the first piece of the company to be stripped away since last summer when <PERSON>Mr. Helmsley</PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON>Leona Helmsley</PERSON>, was found guilty of tax evasion. 
<ORGANIZATION>Frank B. Hall Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Briarcliff Manor</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION> is reportedly working out an agreement with <PERSON>Helmsley</PERSON>.
"Although it probably has reduced the level of expenditures for some purchasers, utilization management -- like most other cost containment strategies -- doesn't appear to have altered the long-term rate of increase in health-care costs," the <ORGANIZATION>Institute of Medicine</ORGANIZATION>, an affiliate of the <ORGANIZATION>National Academy of Sciences</ORGANIZATION>, concluded after a two-year study. "Employers who saw a short-term moderation in benefit expenditures are seeing a return to previous trends." 
<PERSON>Howard Bailit</PERSON>, a panel member and a vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Aetna Life & Casualty</ORGANIZATION>, said that utilization management will also do a better job of containing costs as it spreads to cover medical services delivered outside of hospitals. "There's pretty good evidence that utilization management has reduced inappropriate hospitalization," he said.
<PERSON>David Rahill</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>A. Foster Higgins & Co.</ORGANIZATION> said that clients of his consulting firm report that utilization management reduces their hospital care bills by about 5%, but he agreed that for the health-care system as whole, some of these savings are offset by administrative and outpatient care costs. 
<PERSON>Dr. Grossman</PERSON>, who also is president of <ORGANIZATION>New England Medical Center Hospitals</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, noted that the hospitals he runs deal with more than 100 utilization management firms and that many of them have different procedures and requirements.
<ORGANIZATION>HealthVest</ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, real estate investment trust, said that <ORGANIZATION>Chemical Bank</ORGANIZATION>, the lead bank under its domestic bank agreement, told it that if $3.3 million owed to the bank group isn't paid by today, the group will call the $120 million that <ORGANIZATION>HealthVest</ORGANIZATION> has outstanding under the credit line.
In addition, <ORGANIZATION>HealthVest</ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Tokyo Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION> also has notified it of a default and said it might take action to cure the default.
<ORGANIZATION>HealthVest</ORGANIZATION> missed an interest payment to <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Tokyo</ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 1.
However, <ORGANIZATION>HealthVest</ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> bank indicated that it won't accelerate <ORGANIZATION>HealthVest</ORGANIZATION>'s $50 million loan. 
<ORGANIZATION>HealthVest</ORGANIZATION> is in a severe liquidity bind because its affiliate, <ORGANIZATION>Healthcare International Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, has failed to make about $10.6 million in principal and interest payments owed since August.
<ORGANIZATION>Healthcare</ORGANIZATION> operates many of the health-care properties that <ORGANIZATION>HealthVest</ORGANIZATION> owns. 
Separately, the <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> concern said it signed letters of intent for the cash and stock purchases of a total of 29 well-servicing rigs from two concerns located in <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Robert M. Gintel</PERSON>, senior partner of a <LOCATION>Greenwich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, investment firm, said he plans to launch a proxy fight against the board of Boston-based <ORGANIZATION>Xtra Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Gintel</PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION>Gintel & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, said he plans to conduct a proxy contest to elect a majority of <ORGANIZATION>Xtra</ORGANIZATION>'s board at the next annual stockholders meeting.
<PERSON>Mr. Gintel</PERSON> has filed suit in <ORGANIZATION>Delaware Chancery Court</ORGANIZATION>, seeking to block Xtra's anti-takeover tactic. 
In a filing with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Gintel</PERSON> said Xtra "has pursued business strategies that aren't in the best interest of stockholders." 
<ORGANIZATION>USX Corp.</ORGANIZATION> declined a <ORGANIZATION>United Steelworkers</ORGANIZATION> request for a reopening of its four-year labor contract that is due to expire Jan. 31, 1991. 
A <ORGANIZATION>United Steelworkers</ORGANIZATION> spokeman said <PERSON>Lynn Williams</PERSON>, the union's president, was out of town.
The union won't respond to the <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> statement until <PERSON>Mr. Williams</PERSON> has studied it, the spokesman said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said its bids for <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Guber-Peters Entertainment Co.</ORGANIZATION> have been cleared by federal antitrust regulators. 
The Japanese company said the waiting period under the <LOCATION>Hart-Scott-Rodino</LOCATION> antitrust act for the $3.4 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> and the $200 million offer for <ORGANIZATION>Guber-Peters</ORGANIZATION> expired Monday.
<ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> has agreed to buy both companies, but is in a legal battle with <ORGANIZATION>Warner Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION> over the services of producers <PERSON>Peter Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jon Peters</PERSON>. 
In a filing with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> also said two more suits have been filed opposing the company's agreement to buy <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> added that a hearing has been set for Thursday in the <ORGANIZATION>Delaware Chancery Court</ORGANIZATION> in one of the suits. 
The <LOCATION>Dayton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, maker of parts for the building and transportation industries said holders of the two issues can convert their stock into common shares through the close of business Dec. 1.
"The market is sending nervous signals," says <PERSON>Peter J. Canelo</PERSON>, chief market strategist for <ORGANIZATION>Bear, Stearns & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, and it's "unwise" to be overcommitted to stocks.
<PERSON>Alan Weston</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Weston Capital Management</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> money-management firm, adds that in periods of uncertainty like today, "it's a good time to cut out the dead branches of your portfolio." 
Not everybody agrees that it's time to trim. "We aren't inclined to prune stock portfolios now," says <PERSON>Steven G. Einhorn</PERSON>, chairman of the investment policy committee of <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ORGANIZATION> "Investors should stay with their stocks.
GET RID OF THE DOGS. "Sell stocks that aren't doing well now, and that don't have good earnings prospects," says <PERSON>Alfred Goldman</PERSON>, technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION>St. Louis-based A.G. Edwards & Sons</ORGANIZATION>. "Most people do just the opposite: They sell their winners and keep their losers." Which types of stocks are most likely to qualify?
A company doesn't have to post a loss to be a candidate for sale, says <PERSON>Charles I. Clough Jr.</PERSON>, chief market strategist at <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>John Markese</PERSON>, director of research for the <ORGANIZATION>American Association of Individual Investors</ORGANIZATION>, raises a cautionary note. "Substituting a rule of thumb for your own judgment" can be a mistake, he says.
The companies apt to run into earnings problems soonest are the ones with heavy debt loads, says <PERSON>Larry Biehl</PERSON>, partner in the <LOCATION>San Mateo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, money-management firm of <ORGANIZATION>Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Canelo</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Bear Stearns</ORGANIZATION> agrees: "If we do have an economic slowdown," he says, "companies with high debt ratios will be dumped en masse." The best course for individual investors is to sell these stocks now, the two advisers say. 
SELL `WHISPER' STOCKS. <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's difficulty in obtaining bank financing for its leveraged buy-out and its resulting price plunge is a tip-off to what's going to happen to "takeover stocks," says <PERSON>Mr. Canelo</PERSON>.
EXAMINE WHAT HAS CHANGED. <PERSON>Tom Schlesinger</PERSON>, market analyst at <ORGANIZATION>A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, says investors should consider selling if there has been a fundamental change in a company since they bought its stock.
Gold and silver broker <PERSON>Preston Semel</PERSON> asked a federal court to halt the <ORGANIZATION>Commodity Exchange</ORGANIZATION> from imposing a record $550,000 fine on his firm. 
The suit, filed in federal court in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, also asks that the <ORGANIZATION>Comex</ORGANIZATION>'s nine-month suspension of <PERSON>Mr. Semel</PERSON> be lifted, pending the broker's appeal of the disciplinary measures.
The <ORGANIZATION>Comex</ORGANIZATION> accused the 39-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Semel</PERSON> of "fraudulent conduct" and improper trading.
<PERSON>Mr. Semel</PERSON> and his firm, <ORGANIZATION>Semel & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, have appealed the <ORGANIZATION>Comex</ORGANIZATION> decision and the sanctions to the <ORGANIZATION>Commodity Futures Trading Commission</ORGANIZATION>.
The <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> building group <ORGANIZATION>Dumez S.A.</ORGANIZATION> said profit jumped 70% in the first half of 1989, partly on the strength of nonrecurring gains from a share issue by its Canadian unit. 
The group noted that 75 million francs of the advance reflected a one-time gain from the June offering by its <ORGANIZATION>United Westburne</ORGANIZATION> unit in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>.
NATIONWIDE HEALTH PROPERTIES, <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, said it wouldn't pay its fourth-quarter dividend, despite a 44% increase in third-quarter earnings, to $3.5 million, or 42 cents a share.
<ORGANIZATION>FileNet Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Costa Mesa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, said it expects to report a third-quarter loss of about $1.8 million, or 17 cents a share, because of a $2.5 million reserve to be taken against potential losses on a contract with the state of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Exxon Corp.</ORGANIZATION> built the plant but closed it in 1985 and sold off much of the equipment to dismantling contractors, from whom <ORGANIZATION>Coastal</ORGANIZATION> bought back much of the equipment. 
Storage, <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, which makes data-storage devices for mainframe computers, said the huge increase in net reflects "strong sales" of its tape products, particularly the 4400 <ORGANIZATION>Automated Cartridge System</ORGANIZATION>, which holds a library of tape cartridges.
For the nine months, <ORGANIZATION>Storage</ORGANIZATION> had net of $25.5 million, or 98 cents a share, including an $11.3 million extraordinary gain for the anticipated proceeds from liquidating an <LOCATION>Irish</LOCATION> unit.
<ORGANIZATION>Doman Industries Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> said it increased its stake in <ORGANIZATION>Western Forest Products Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> to 56% from 22%, through a two-step transaction valued at 137 million Canadian dollars ($US116.7 million). 
Doman is based in <LOCATION>Duncan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>British Columbia</LOCATION>.
The company, founded and controlled by <PERSON>Harbanse Doman</PERSON>, its chairman and president, said the purchase would make it <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s 10th largest forest products company. 
Under terms of the transaction, which was proposed in June, <PERSON>Doman</PERSON> said it acquired <ORGANIZATION>International Forest Products Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> 's 22% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Western Forest</ORGANIZATION>, and Western Forest, in a related transaction, bought back a 22% interest in the company from <ORGANIZATION>Fletcher Challenge Canada Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Fletcher Challenge Canada</ORGANIZATION> stake was then canceled, <PERSON>Doman</PERSON> said, raising <PERSON>Doman</PERSON>'s interest in <ORGANIZATION>Western Forest</ORGANIZATION> to 56%.
<PERSON>Doman</PERSON> said it was also granted an option to acquire the remaining 44% interest in Western Forest, which is currently held by two <LOCATION>Canadian</LOCATION> banks. 
<ORGANIZATION>International Forest</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Western Forest</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Fletcher Challenge Canada</ORGANIZATION> are Vancouver-based forest products concerns. 
A Canadian government agency conditionally approved proposed exports to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> of natural gas from big, untapped fields in the <LOCATION>Mackenzie River</LOCATION> delta area of the western Canadian Arctic. 
Three companies, <ORGANIZATION>Esso Resources Canada Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Shell Canada Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Canada Resources Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, applied to the <ORGANIZATION>Canadian National Energy Board</ORGANIZATION> to export 9.2 trillion cubic feet of <LOCATION>Mackenzie</LOCATION> delta natural gas over 20 years starting in 1996. 
The board said the export licenses would be issued on the condition that <LOCATION>Canadian</LOCATION> interests would also be allowed to bid for the <ORGANIZATION>Mackenzie</ORGANIZATION> delta gas on terms similar to those offered to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> customers. 
They include <ORGANIZATION>Enron Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Texas Eastern Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Interstate Transmission Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
The project could result in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> taking more than 10% of its natural gas supplies from <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, up from about 5% currently.
The board estimated that the cost of building a pipeline from the <LOCATION>Mackenzie</LOCATION> delta to <LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION> would be about C$5.9 million.
<ORGANIZATION>Esso</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Oil Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> which is 71%-owned by <ORGANIZATION>Exxon Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, will be allowed to export 5.1 trillion cubic feet to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in the 20-year period.
<ORGANIZATION>Shell</ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Royal Dutch/Shell Group</ORGANIZATION>, will be allowed to export 0.9 trillion cubic feet, and <LOCATION>Gulf</LOCATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Olympia & York Developments Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> will be allowed to export 3.2 trillion cubic feet. 
The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Export-Import Bank</ORGANIZATION> tentatively decided to guarantee commercial bank financing for the purchase of two <ORGANIZATION>Boeing Co.</ORGANIZATION> 767 airliners by <LOCATION>Avianca</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>'s international airline, at a cost of about $150 million. 
Because of the size of the proposed loan guarantee, the <ORGANIZATION>Ex-Im Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s preliminary commitment is subject to review by the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate Banking</ORGANIZATION> committees.
Year-earlier net of $21 million, or 84 cents a share, included the results of <LOCATION>Loral</LOCATION>'s former <ORGANIZATION>Aircraft Braking Systems and Engineered Fabrics</ORGANIZATION> divisions, which were sold April 27 to the company's chairman, <PERSON>Bernard L. Schwartz</PERSON>. 
The increase was due mainly to a $325 million order from <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> to equip its fleet of F-16 fighters with <LOCATION>Loral</LOCATION>'s ALQ-178 Rapport <ORGANIZATION>III</ORGANIZATION> electronic countermeasures system.
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>Loral</ORGANIZATION> closed at $33.25, down 37.5 cents. 
<ORGANIZATION>PPG Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, hurt by softness in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> automotive and construction industries, said third-quarter net income fell 5.5% to $106.7 million, or 97 cents a share, from $112.9 million, or $1.03 a share, a year ago. 
The coating segment also posted higher sales particularly in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>PPG</ORGANIZATION> closed at $41 a share, down 37.5 cents. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> shares lost 37.5 cents to $18.125. 
Tuesday's earthquake will depress local real-estate values in the short term and force companies to reconsider expanding in or relocating to the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, real-estate and relocation specialists said. 
This isn't going to help," said <PERSON>Kenneth T. Rosen</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Rosen</PERSON>, among others, suggested that the quake, the strongest since the 1906 temblor that struck <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, will in the short term create a two-tier price system for quake-prone communities, with dwellings built on sturdy ground likely to demand higher prices. 
One <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> neighborhood likely to test <PERSON>Mr. Rosen</PERSON>'s theory soon is the city's fashionable <LOCATION>Marina district</LOCATION>, which boasts some of the highest home prices in the state.
Brokers agreed with the two-tier price theory. "My gut feeling is that the <LOCATION>Marina</LOCATION> properties will be affected," said <PERSON>Grace Perkins</PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Grubb & Ellis Residential Brokerage Inc</ORGANIZATION>. Neither she nor other real-estate executives and brokers could project how much less <PERSON>Marina</PERSON> properties might bring, but she said the two-tier price structure would affect prices "for a while." 
"What you're going to get is 'We don't want to put all of our eggs in one basket' theory," said <PERSON>James H. Renzas</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Location Management Services Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, relocation concern. 
<PERSON>Mr. Renzas</PERSON>, among others, said the quake will prod companies in certain industries, like semiconductors, computers and aerospace, to consider moving operations that involve particularly sensitive machinery to locations outside <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
One <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> aerospace firm, for example, two months ago asked <ORGANIZATION>Location Management</ORGANIZATION> to compare the costs of reinforcing its current building against earthquakes with the cost of building a new structure elsewhere.
Prices also rose on almost every other major exchange in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Nikkei</ORGANIZATION> index of 225 issues, which gained 111.48 points Wednesday, climbed 266.66, or 0.76%, to 35374.22.
In early trading in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Friday, the <ORGANIZATION>Nikkei</ORGANIZATION> index rose 170.65 points, to 35544.87. 
Sentiment was helped by the small gain made by <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> stocks Wednesday despite anxiety over possible effects of the major earthquake that struck northern <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Tuesday. 
Having survived both last Friday's 6.9% Wall Street plunge and the immediate aftermath of the <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> area earthquake, <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> market participants expressed relief that trading had returned to normal. 
<PERSON>Hiroyuki Murai</PERSON>, general manager of the stock trading division at <ORGANIZATION>Nikko Securities</ORGANIZATION>, said that after looking at the reasons for Friday's Wall Street plunge, participants realized that the <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> markets have different economic fundamentals.
<PERSON>Yoshiaki Mitsuoka</PERSON>, head of the investment information department at <ORGANIZATION>Daiwa Investment Trust & Management</ORGANIZATION>, said that if <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> stocks just fluctuate in or near their current range, the <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> market will remain firm with a moderately upward trend for the rest of the year. 
"Investor interest switches back and forth ceaselessly as they are unable to shift their weight to one side for sure," <PERSON>Mr. Mitsuoka</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Daiwa Investment Trust</ORGANIZATION> said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Fujisawa Pharmaceutical</ORGANIZATION> gained 130 to 1,930 yen ($13.64) a share, <ORGANIZATION>Mochida Pharmaceutical</ORGANIZATION> was up 150 at 4,170, and <ORGANIZATION>Eisai</ORGANIZATION> advanced 60 to 2,360. 
<ORGANIZATION>Daiwa House</ORGANIZATION> advanced 100 to 2,610, <ORGANIZATION>Misawa Homes</ORGANIZATION> was up 60 at 2,940, and <ORGANIZATION>Sekisui House</ORGANIZATION> gained 100 to 2,490. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ohbayashi</ORGANIZATION> was up 60 to close at 1,680, <PERSON>Shimizu</PERSON> gained 50 to 2,120, and <ORGANIZATION>Kumagai-Gumi</ORGANIZATION> advanced 40 to 1,490. 
Other winners included real estate issues <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Estate</ORGANIZATION>, which closed at 2,500, up 130, and <ORGANIZATION>Mitsui Real Estate Development</ORGANIZATION>, which gained 100 to 2,890. 
<ORGANIZATION>Kawasaki Steel</ORGANIZATION> was down 11 at 788, <ORGANIZATION>Kobe Steel</ORGANIZATION> lost 5 to 723, and <ORGANIZATION>Nippon Steel</ORGANIZATION> slipped 6 to 729. 
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Financial Times-Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> 100-share index finished 19.2 points higher at 2189.3.
B.A.T Industries surged in afternoon dealings after its shareholders approved a plan to dispose of its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> retailing operations to fend off <ORGANIZATION>Hoylake Investment</ORGANIZATION>'s #13.4 billion ($21.33 billion) hostile bid.
In other European markets, shares closed sharply higher in <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and higher in <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>.
Prices also closed higher in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> but were lower in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>. 
Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>TransAtlantic Holdings PLC</ORGANIZATION>, a British-based, South African-controlled financial services investment group, and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Societe Centrale Union des Assurances de Paris</ORGANIZATION> reached an accord effectively reducing chances of an unfriendly takeover for <ORGANIZATION>Sun Life Assurance Society PLC</ORGANIZATION>. 
In a joint statement, the two companies, whose combined holdings equal 52.7% of <ORGANIZATION>Sun Life</ORGANIZATION>'s ordinary shares, said their agreement is aimed at reducing "the uncertainty and instability for <ORGANIZATION>Sun Life</ORGANIZATION> that has resulted from two major shareholders owning" a controlling interest in the company. 
<ORGANIZATION>TransAtlantic</ORGANIZATION>, whose <ORGANIZATION>Transol Investments Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> unit owns the largest minority stake in <LOCATION>Sun Life</LOCATION>, has agreed not to make a takeover bid for the British life insurer without the prior consent of the French company, known as <ORGANIZATION>UAP</ORGANIZATION>.
In return, the agreement would force <ORGANIZATION>UAP</ORGANIZATION> to buy <ORGANIZATION>TransAtlantic</ORGANIZATION>'s 29.8% holding in <ORGANIZATION>Sun Life</ORGANIZATION> or sell its 22.9% stake to <ORGANIZATION>TransAtlantic</ORGANIZATION> at a price set by <ORGANIZATION>Transatlantic</ORGANIZATION>. 
Renault and <ORGANIZATION>DAF Trucks NV</ORGANIZATION> announced a preliminary agreement to jointly manufacture a line of trucks in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Philippe Gras</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Renault</ORGANIZATION> managing director, said the new line will cover trucks of between 2.5 tons and 4.2 tons and will be built at <ORGANIZATION>Renault</ORGANIZATION>'s Bapilly plant in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and at <ORGANIZATION>DAF</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> plant.
The venture is the latest example of the trend toward cooperative projects in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> ahead of the 1992 deadline for eliminating trade barriers within the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Gras</PERSON> said the joint venture represents considerable savings for both <ORGANIZATION>Renault</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>DAF</ORGANIZATION>, since both companies would in any case have had to renew their existing ranges of light goods vehicles.
Renault officials said the potential European market for light trucks in the 2.5-ton to 4.2-ton range is between 700,000 and 800,000 vehicles annually, and <PERSON>Renault</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>DAF</ORGANIZATION> are aiming for a combined market share of about 11%. 
Both <PERSON>Renault</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>DAF</ORGANIZATION> will have world-wide marketing rights for the new range of vans and light trucks.
Under a separate arrangement, <ORGANIZATION>British Aerospace PLC</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Rover Group PLC</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary will also be able to offer the vehicles through its dealers in the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Renault</ORGANIZATION>'s truck-building subsidiary <ORGANIZATION>Renault Vehicles Industriels</ORGANIZATION> will have similar rights in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>DAF</ORGANIZATION> is 16%-owned by <ORGANIZATION>British Aerospace</ORGANIZATION>, with a further 6.5% held by the Dutch state-owned chemical group <ORGANIZATION>NV DSM</ORGANIZATION>.
The <PERSON>van Doorne</PERSON> family of the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION> holds an additional 11% of <ORGANIZATION>DAF</ORGANIZATION>'s capital. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Federal National Mortgage Association</ORGANIZATION> said 39 lenders across the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> have agreed to offer home loans under <ORGANIZATION>Fannie Mae</ORGANIZATION>'s pilot program for elderly people. 
<ORGANIZATION>Fannie Mae</ORGANIZATION>, a federally chartered and shareholder-owned company, said the lenders include <ORGANIZATION>Prudential Home Mortgage Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Prudential Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> that operates in every state.
<ORGANIZATION>Prudential Insurance</ORGANIZATION> is based in <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION> 
As the music swells, viewers discover they're watching a commercial for Lone Star Beer, the pride of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, a product of <ORGANIZATION>G. Heileman Brewing Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>La Crosse</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION>, unit of <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
As the ad's tone implies, the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> spirit is pretty xenophobic these days, and <ORGANIZATION>Lone Star</ORGANIZATION> isn't alone in trying to take advantage of that.
In the past, writes <ORGANIZATION>Houston Chronicle</ORGANIZATION> columnist <PERSON>Jim Barlow</PERSON>, outlanders were accepted only after passing a series of tests to prove they had the "right" <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> attitudes and "of course they had to be dipped for parasites." 
<ORGANIZATION>Lone Star's Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION> parent, for instance, hails from <LOCATION>Perth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
North Carolinians, <LOCATION>New Yorkers</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Californians</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Chicagoans</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ohioans</LOCATION> own <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> banks.
Even the beloved <ORGANIZATION>Dallas Cowboys</ORGANIZATION> were bought by an <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> oil man. 
"<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> has lost its distinctiveness, leaving Texans with a hunger to feel proud about themselves," says <PERSON>Stephen Klineberg</PERSON>, a sociology professor at <ORGANIZATION>Rice University</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>. "This plays right into the hands of the advertising agencies." 
For example, the iced-tea radio campaign for <PERSON>Thomas J. Lipton Co.</PERSON>, an <LOCATION>Englewood Cliffs</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, unit of <ORGANIZATION>Anglo-Dutch Unilever Group</ORGANIZATION>, emphatically proclaims: "Real Texans do not wear dock-siders -- ever.
In developing that theme at <ORGANIZATION>Interpublic Group of Cos.</ORGANIZATION> ' Lintas: <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> unit, account supervisor <PERSON>Lisa Buksbaum</PERSON> says she made a "couple of phone calls" to <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> ad friends and reported her "findings" to a team of writers.
<PERSON>Stan Richards</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Richards Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, tells of the Texan who saw the agency's tear-jerking commercial for <ORGANIZATION>First Gibraltar Bank F.S.B.</ORGANIZATION> -- complete with the state's anthem -- and promptly invested $100,000 in the thrift's CDs.
Never mind that <ORGANIZATION>First Gibraltar</ORGANIZATION> is one of the failed <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> thrifts taken over by outsiders -- in this case, an investor group headed by <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> financier <PERSON>Ronald Perelman</PERSON>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>North Texas Chevy Dealers</ORGANIZATION> recently had a record sales month after the debut of ad campaign that thumbs its nose at elite <ORGANIZATION>Easterners</ORGANIZATION>.
And deposits at <ORGANIZATION>NCNB Texas National Bank</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>NCNB Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, have increased $2 billion since last year after heavy advertising stressing commitment to <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. "Obviously, pride sells in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>," says a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION>Bozell Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neb.</LOCATION>, which represents 
Ford trucks may outsell Chevy trucks in places like "<LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION>," sniffs a commercial for Chevrolet, a division of <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
The commercial, created by <PERSON>Bateman</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Bryan & Galles Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, adds derisively: "I bet it takes a real tough truck to haul your Ivy League buddies to the yacht club." Because they want a truck that is "<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> tough," the commercial concludes, "Texans drive <ORGANIZATION>Chevy</ORGANIZATION>." 
<ORGANIZATION>J.C. Penney Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which relocated from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to suburban <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> two years ago, gently wraps itself in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> pride through a full-page magazine ad: "Taking the long-range view to conserve what is of value to future generations is part of the <ORGANIZATION>Lone Star</ORGANIZATION> lifestyle," the ad reads. "It's part of our style, too." 
The most-strident anti-outsider sentiment among bankers comes from the <ORGANIZATION>Independent Bankers Association of Texas</ORGANIZATION>, although it's hard to tell from previews of the $5 million "The I's of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>" TV campaign.
A video sent to association members, featuring shots of the <LOCATION>Alamo</LOCATION>, cowboys, fajitas and a statue of <PERSON>Sam Houston</PERSON>, doesn't mince words. "Texans can sniff a phony a mile away," the narrator warns outsiders. "So, don't come and try to con us with a howdy y'all or a cowboy hat." 
In a statement, <ORGANIZATION>Alex Kroll, Young & Rubicam</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, said "under the present circumstances {we} have agreed that it is prudent to discontinue that contract." <ORGANIZATION>Young & Rubicam</ORGANIZATION> has pleaded innocent to the charges.
NEW ACCOUNT: <ORGANIZATION>Sunshine Biscuits Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Woodbridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, awarded its estimated $5 million account to <ORGANIZATION>Waring & LaRosa</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
The account had been at <ORGANIZATION>Della Femina McNamee WCRS</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
MEDIA POLICY: <ORGANIZATION>MacNamara Clapp & Klein</ORGANIZATION>, a small <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> shop, is asking magazine ad representatives to tell it when major advertising inserts will run in their publications.
The ad is part of <ORGANIZATION>Classic Coke</ORGANIZATION>'s 1990 ad campaign, with the tag line, "Can't beat the Real Thing." Basketball star <PERSON>Michael Jordan</PERSON> and singer <PERSON>Randy Travis</PERSON> have also agreed to appear in ads. 
<ORGANIZATION>Computer Sciences Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>El Segundo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> will negotiate details of a contract valued at about $170 million to provide software for the <ORGANIZATION>Ames Research Center</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> awarded the contract to <ORGANIZATION>CSC</ORGANIZATION> in November but an appeal by <ORGANIZATION>Sterling Software Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> sent the contract to the <ORGANIZATION>General Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals</ORGANIZATION> and the board required <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> to re-evaluate bidders' proposals.
As directed by the board, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> completed the evaluation and again chose <ORGANIZATION>CSC</ORGANIZATION>.

Data for 1987 from the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Suggestion Systems</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Japan Human Relations Association</ORGANIZATION> also indicate that Japanese employers adopt four of five suggestions, while their <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> counterparts accept just one in four. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies tend to favor suggestions "that go for the home runs," says <PERSON>Gary Floss</PERSON>, vice president of corporate quality at <ORGANIZATION>Control Data Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
That helps explain why <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> employers grant an average award of $604.72 per suggestion, while <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s payment is $3.23.
A Security magazine survey places the effect of takeovers and buy-outs among the industry's 10 biggest challenges. "If it causes management to take their eye off the ball, inventory shrinkage is going to be affected," says <PERSON>Lewis Shealy</PERSON>, vice president for loss prevention at <ORGANIZATION>Marshall Field's</ORGANIZATION>, the department store chain. 
Security consultant <PERSON>Dennis Dalton</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Ventura</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, thinks mergers often trigger longer lunch hours and increased absenteeism, conduct which can sap the bottom line more than thefts. 
Consultant <PERSON>John Keller</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Southlake</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, urges that top management adopt a "tough hands-on approach" with very tight controls and monitoring.
A survey by <ORGANIZATION>Sirota, Alper & Pfau</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> consulting firm, underscores the difficulty for top management in satisfying employees and investors on that score. 
<ORGANIZATION>Cipher Data</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> maker of magnetic tape peripherals and optical disc drives, said the loss included reserves of $3.8 million related to a corporate restructuring. 
<ORGANIZATION>Cipher Data</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Mr. Marinaro</PERSON> consequently has resigned from those posts and from the company's board.
<ORGANIZATION>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the newly merged drug and health-care-product company, reported record third-quarter earnings for both companies in the merger.

<ORGANIZATION>Amdura Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said its bank group, led by Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION>Continental Bank</ORGANIZATION>, agreed to extend its $40 million bridge loan until March 31, 1990, and gave it a new $30 million credit line. 
<ORGANIZATION>Amdura</ORGANIZATION>'s bridge loan, part of the financing for <ORGANIZATION>Amdura</ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>CoastAmerica</ORGANIZATION> in December 1988, was to come due next Friday.
<LOCATION>Amdura</LOCATION>, a <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> hardware and automotive distributor, said the new credit agreement will provide the working capital needed to meet ongoing requirements. 
<ORGANIZATION>Clinton Gas Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it received a contract from <ORGANIZATION>Timken Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Canton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, to manage the natural gas purchasing, scheduling and transportation activities for <ORGANIZATION>Timken</ORGANIZATION>'s seven <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and two <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> plants. 
<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Timken</PERSON> agreed not to disclose the value of the contract. 
<PERSON>Timken</PERSON>, a producer of bearings and specialty steel, already buys gas from <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, that its <PERSON>Clinton Gas Marketing</PERSON> unit wants to line up a number of such gas management contracts.
Manufacturers frequently don't have anyone who is a specialist in natural gas, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> said, and a specialist such as <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> can save them substantial amounts of money.

Just last month, a <ORGANIZATION>Bank of New York</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary agreed to buy the credit-card operation of <ORGANIZATION>Dreyfus Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Dreyfus Consumer Bank</ORGANIZATION> for $168 million, a transaction that is expected to be completed by the end of the year. 
<ORGANIZATION>First City</ORGANIZATION>, which issues both <ORGANIZATION>MasterCard</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Visa</ORGANIZATION> cards, has agreed to act as an agent bank. 
<ORGANIZATION>First City</ORGANIZATION> said that because of increased competition in the credit-card business, it had decided it either had to expand its own holdings substantially or sell them. "We think there's a good prospect that competition is going to get pretty fierce in this market," said <PERSON>James E. Day</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>First City</ORGANIZATION> vice president. "We see it becoming a bargain-basement kind of business." 
<ORGANIZATION>First City</ORGANIZATION>, which recently purchased three small <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> banking concerns, said it would use the proceeds to pursue additional expansion opportunities in the <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION> and elsewhere.
"I think they'll be able to move faster to make acquisitions in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>," said <PERSON>Brent Erensel</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette</ORGANIZATION>. "That's something they can do very well." 
Slowing sales of its profitable Jeep Cherokee and Wagoneer sport utility vehicles are forcing <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to temporarily idle its <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, assembly plant for the first time since April 1986. 
Sales of <LOCATION>Cherokee</LOCATION>, the best-selling Jeep, and the lower-volume <PERSON>Wagoneer</PERSON> were actually up about 10% through the end of last month.
But that's less than <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> officials had hoped when they set ambitious production schedules for the <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION> plant earlier this year. 
Even when it became clear this spring that demand wasn't coming up to expectations, <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> officials "resisted" cutting output because <LOCATION>Cherokee</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Wagoneer</PERSON> are "very profitable vehicles," the spokesman said. 
Instead, <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> officials in late May slapped $1,000 cash rebates on the vehicles, including the first such incentives on the popular four-door <ORGANIZATION>Cherokee</ORGANIZATION> since <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> bought Jeep in 1987.
The result: <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> dealers had a bloated 82-day supply of the Cherokee as of the end of last month and a 161-day supply of the Comanche pickup, which <PERSON>Toledo</PERSON> also builds.
<PERSON>Steve Lowe</PERSON>, general manager of <LOCATION>Jasper</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, dealership, said new rebates of $500 to $1,000 on the models have stimulated sales, but not enough to significantly cut dealer stocks. "If people aren't buying, you have to close plants," he said. 
Separately, <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> said it will idle for four weeks the <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> assembly plant that builds the <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler LeBaron</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Dodge Daytona</ORGANIZATION> models.
<ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, said it will idle for yet another week its <LOCATION>Linden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, assembly plant, bringing to three weeks the total time that plant will be idled during October. 
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> said the assembly plant, which builds the <ORGANIZATION>Chevrolet Corsica</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Beretta</LOCATION> compact cars, originally was scheduled to reopen Monday but now will not resume production until Oct. 30.
Sluggish sales of the <LOCATION>Beretta</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Corsica</LOCATION> spurred <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> to offer $800 rebates on those cars.
The <LOCATION>Corsica</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Beretta</LOCATION> make up the highest-volume car line at Chevrolet, but sales of the cars are off 9.6% for the year, and fell a steep 34.2% early this month. 
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> has scheduled overtime at its <LOCATION>Lordstown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Janesville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION>, assembly plants, which build the <ORGANIZATION>Chevrolet Cavalier</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> said it will shut down for one week its <ORGANIZATION>Kentucky Truck Plant</ORGANIZATION> because of a "shortage of dealer orders." The shutdown will idle 2,000 hourly employees and eliminate production of about 1,300 medium and heavy duty trucks.

Is an American Secretary of <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION> seriously suggesting that the <ORGANIZATION>Khmer Rouge</ORGANIZATION> should help govern <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION>?
There are no easy choices in <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION>, but we can't imagine that it benefits the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> to become the catalyst for an all-too-familiar process that could end in another round of horror in <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION>. 
Now that <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> appears to have pulled out its occupation army, the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> is talking again about accepting an "interim" coalition government in the <LOCATION>Cambodian</LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION>Phnom Penh</LOCATION>.
The coalition would include the current Vietnamese-backed <PERSON>Hun Sen</PERSON> regime, the two non-communist resistance groups led by <PERSON>Son Sann</PERSON> and <PERSON>Prince Sihanouk</PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION>Khmer Rouge</ORGANIZATION>.
The aim would be to end the guerrilla war for control of <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION> by allowing the <ORGANIZATION>Khmer Rouge</ORGANIZATION> a small share of power.
The <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> says that any <ORGANIZATION>Khmer Rouge</ORGANIZATION> participation would have to be "minimal." 
Recall that <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Sandinistas</PERSON> came into <LOCATION>Managua</LOCATION> as partners in a coalition government with anti-Somoza moderates.
Within two years, the moderates were exiled or in prison, <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> had gone communist, and the Sandinistas were building one of the biggest armies in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> and threatening their neighbors.
Even <PERSON>Mao Tse-tung</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> began in 1949 with a partnership between the communists and a number of smaller, non-communist parties. 
What complicates the scene in <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION> is that the current regime is already communist, as are its Vietnamese overseers back in <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION>, as are the <ORGANIZATION>Khmer Rouge</ORGANIZATION> -- who are the strongest of the three guerrilla groups.
That would leave <PERSON>Hun Sen</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>Khmer Rouge</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <PERSON>Hun Sen</PERSON> regime has sent thousands of conscript laborers to die of malaria and malnourishment while building <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION>'s equivalent of the <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> Wall near the <LOCATION>Thai</LOCATION> border.
The <ORGANIZATION>Khmer Rouge</ORGANIZATION>, however, carry an unsurpassed record for <LOCATION>Cambodian</LOCATION> tyranny.
Some of our sources in <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> say the notorious old <ORGANIZATION>Khmer Rouge</ORGANIZATION> leader, <PERSON>Pol Pot</PERSON>, has been holed up this summer in <ORGANIZATION>Khmer Rouge</ORGANIZATION> camps near the Thai-Cambodian border. 
So it's difficult to swallow the notion that <PERSON>Mr. Baker</PERSON> is willing to accept conditions that would help the <ORGANIZATION>Khmer Rouge</ORGANIZATION> set up shop again in <LOCATION>Phnom Penh</LOCATION>.
But <PERSON>Prince Sihanouk</PERSON> has backed all sorts of ideas over the years, and done rather better by himself than by <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION>.
Nor should the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> worry much about offending <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, which still aids the <ORGANIZATION>Khmer Rouge</ORGANIZATION>.
It's time the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> recognized that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> does not play by gentlemen's rules. 
For the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> to lend even the slightest support to the most infamous killers on <LOCATION>Indochina</LOCATION>'s bleak scene could only disturb <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s allies elsewhere.
It would be entirely rational for communist insurgents in countries such as the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> to conclude the following: Fight viciously enough and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, under the banner of pragmatism, might eventually help negotiate your way to victory.
The administration and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> have lately tangoed around the idea of sending military aid to <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION>'s non-communists.
But now the possibility of "diplomatic movement" (<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s withdrawal, the Baker initiative) has put that plan on hold, with the proviso that if the going got rough, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> would then rearm the opposition.
At the very least, the odds are heavily weighted against the prospects of preventing the <ORGANIZATION>Khmer Rouge</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION>'s communists from ultimately moving against their opponents.
Analysts said the results were as expected, but several added that the earnings masked underlying weaknesses in several businesses. "The quality of earnings wasn't as high as I expected," said <PERSON>Eric Philo</PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Dun & Bradstreet</ORGANIZATION> said operating earnings rose 8%, excluding the sale of <ORGANIZATION>Official Airline Guides</ORGANIZATION>. 
Third-quarter sales of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> credit services were "disappointingly below sales" of a year earlier, <ORGANIZATION>Dun & Bradstreet</ORGANIZATION> said.
Analysts predict the sales impact will linger. "There isn't much question there will continue to be a ripple effect," said <PERSON>John Reidy</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Dun & Bradstreet</ORGANIZATION> noted that price competition in its <ORGANIZATION>Nielsen Marketing Research</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Nielsen Clearing House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Donnelley Marketing</ORGANIZATION> businesses also restrained revenue growth.
It cited cyclical conditions in its <ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>D&B Plan Services</ORGANIZATION> units. 
"It's pretty much weak across the board," said <PERSON>Martin Regalia</PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION>National Council of Savings Institutions</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unit dipped to a session low against the mark just after the release of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> consumer price index.
In <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Friday, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> currency opened for trading at 141.93 yen, up from Thursday's <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> close of 141.55 yen. 
They noted that because the consumer price index, known as the CPI, is a more comprehensive measure of inflation and is rising less rapidly than the producer-price index, or <ORGANIZATION>PPI</ORGANIZATION>, it could signal further easing by <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Kevin Logan</PERSON>, chief economist with the <ORGANIZATION>Swiss Bank Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said that both <ORGANIZATION>PPI</ORGANIZATION> and CPI climbed around 4 1/2% year-to-year in September.
"The <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> won't be stampeded into easing," <PERSON>Mr. Logan</PERSON> said, predicting that for now, interest rates will stay where they are. 
"There's a bottomless pit of dollar demand" by Japanese investors, said <PERSON>Graham Beale</PERSON>, managing director of foreign exchange at <ORGANIZATION>Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, adding that purely speculative demand wouldn't hold the dollar at its recent levels against the Japanese currency. 
<PERSON>Robert White</PERSON>, manager of corporate trading at <ORGANIZATION>First Interstate of California</ORGANIZATION>, called the market "psychologically pro-mark," noting that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> remains a "veritable grab bag" for Japanese investors which accounts for the unabated demand for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollars. 
On the <ORGANIZATION>Commodity Exchange</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, gold dropped $1.60 to $367.10 an ounce in moderate trading.
Housing, for instance, has remained a fairly steady component of household assets over the past decade -- although common wisdom would have expected an increase. "There is a lot of attention paid to housing as a form of household wealth," says <PERSON>Edward N. Wolff</PERSON>, professor of economics at <ORGANIZATION>New York University</ORGANIZATION>. "But it hasn't increased much relative to other assets.
In addition, investors' desire to hold stocks -- directly and through mutual funds -- has held surprisingly steady; stocks' importance among assets largely reflects the ups and downs of the stock market, and not a shift in stock-holding preferences. "Stocks have not spread to the general public, despite the fact that the environment is much different," concludes <PERSON>Robert Avery</PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION>Cornell University</ORGANIZATION>. "To me it says that despite all the views that we spend too much of our wealth on paper assets, we have ways of holding wealth similar to 100 years ago." 
<ORGANIZATION>G.D. Searle & Co.</ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION>Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION> approved the sale of <LOCATION>Kerlone</LOCATION>, a hypertension drug developed by a joint venture between <ORGANIZATION>Searle</ORGANIZATION> and a <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> concern. 
<LOCATION>Searle</LOCATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Monsanto Co.</ORGANIZATION>, said the "beta-blocker" high-blood-pressure drug <PERSON>Kerlone</PERSON> is the first product to reach the market through <ORGANIZATION>Lorex Pharmaceuticals</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> company jointly owned by <ORGANIZATION>Searle</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Synthelabo</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> pharmaceutical concern owned by <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>L'Oreal S.A.</ORGANIZATION> 
<ORGANIZATION>Fletcher Challenge Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> said its <ORGANIZATION>Petrocorp</ORGANIZATION> unit agreed to acquire certain <LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION> oil and gas interests from <ORGANIZATION>Amoco Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <LOCATION>Canadian</LOCATION> unit, for about 130 million Canadian dollars (US$110.6 million). 
<PERSON>Fletcher Challenge</PERSON>, a big New Zealand-based forest products concern with forestry operations in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, said the assets include stakes in four natural gas fields and one oil field near <LOCATION>Provost</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION>, plus gas processing facilities and about 247,000 acres of undeveloped land.
The proposed purchase requires approval from <ORGANIZATION>Investment Canada</ORGANIZATION>, which monitors large foreign investments in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Petrocorp</ORGANIZATION>, a New Zealand-based oil and gas producer, said the planned purchase would be its first oil and gas acquisition outside its home country, and would form the basis for a new stand-alone exploration and production unit in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Sam Ginn</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, told securities analysts in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> that the company expects somewhat slower per-share earnings growth in 1990, although annual growth should return to the traditional figure of about 7% thereafter. 
But as <PERSON>Judge Thomas M. Jenkins</PERSON> donned his robes so he could give final approval, the major earthquake struck, its epicenter not far from his courtroom in <LOCATION>Redwood City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. 
And the lawyers were just as eager as the judge to wrap it up. "We were never going to get these insurance companies to agree again," says <PERSON>John V. Trump</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> defense lawyer in the case. 
For the record, <PERSON>Jeffrey Kaufman</PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON>Fireman</PERSON>'s Fund, said he was "rattled -- both literally and figuratively." 
The insurance adjusters think differently. "I didn't know if it was World War III or what," says <PERSON>Melanie Carvain</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Morristown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION> "Reading the settlement into the record was the last thing on my mind." 
A half-dozen Soviet space officials, in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> in July for an exhibit, stopped by to see their counterparts at the <ORGANIZATION>National Space Development Agency of Japan</ORGANIZATION>.
"We were just surprised," says <PERSON>Tad Inada</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>NASDA</ORGANIZATION>'s director for international affairs. "Shocked." 
That <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, with its dilapidated economic machine, would try to sell high technology to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, one of the world's high-tech leaders, sounds like a coals-to-Newcastle notion.
But "the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> has areas where it isn't behind <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>," says <PERSON>Mikhail Shapovalov</PERSON> of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. "We have obtained through the development of Cosmos {the Soviet space program} technologies you don't see anywhere else." 
<LOCATION>Japan-U.S.</LOCATION> trade relations are bumpy these days, and some Japanese favor decreasing their reliance on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> technology in light of the <ORGANIZATION>FSX</ORGANIZATION> fighter-plane flap, when <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials reversed an earlier decision and refused to share certain crucial fighter-plane technology. 
Soviet efforts to sell their technology abroad don't appear to worry the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s principal ally. "We have never opposed the development of economic relations between our allies and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>," says a <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> official. "Frankly, I wouldn't expect the Japanese to get hooked on anybody's technology, least of all the Soviets." 
The Soviets held export exhibitions that included high-tech items in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>.
Last week, a <LOCATION>Soviet</LOCATION> delegation came to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to push more space technologies. 
In August, representatives of <ORGANIZATION>Keidanren</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s largest business organization, visited <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> to explore exports and investments that would help the Soviet economy.
But, while the Soviets can't expect direct technology flow from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, they also hope to benefit from Japanese manufacturing expertise. "The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> has a lot of know-how, but it has been difficult to put that into actual production because of various structural problems in the economy," says <PERSON>Mr. Shapovalov</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> official.
Still stinging from the international backlash over the sale two years ago of sensitive military technology to the Soviets by a subsidiary of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Toshiba Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, many Japanese are eager to avoid appearing to help the Soviets in any way.
Another hurdle concerns <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s attempts to persuade the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> to relinquish its post-World War II control of four islands north of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
And what they have shown isn't impressive. "My impression is that there isn't anything which arouses our interest at first glance," says an official from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of International Trade and Industry</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Peter Gumbel</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> contributed to this article.

<PERSON>Jeanette Traverso</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> lawyer, gave up running three times a week to play a weekly round of golf, finding it more social and serene.

Slightly more, like <PERSON>Leslie Sherren</PERSON>, a law librarian in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> who attends dance aerobics five times a week, exercise to relieve stress. "Working with lawyers," she says, "I need it." 
But fully 90% of those polled felt they didn't need to belong to a health club.

Besides the Machinists pact, accords representing 30,000 of the company's engineering and technical employees in the <ORGANIZATION>Puget Sound</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Wichita</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kan.</LOCATION>, areas expire in early December.
Also, a contract with the <ORGANIZATION>United Auto Workers</ORGANIZATION> at the company's helicopter plant in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> expired Oct. 15.
In a separate matter, the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> yesterday said <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay the government $11 million to settle claims that the company provided inaccurate cost information to the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> while negotiating contracts to replace the aluminum skins on the KC-135 tanker aircraft. 
<ORGANIZATION>Kidder Peabody</ORGANIZATION> became the most recent firm to swear off stock-index arbitrage trading for its own account, and <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION> late yesterday took the major step of renouncing the trading strategy even for its clients. 
Describing this and other grisly killings, <PERSON>Sen. Strom Thurmond</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>) recently urged fellow lawmakers to revive a broad federal death penalty. "The ultimate punishment," he declared, "will protect the law-abiding from the vicious, cruel individuals who commit these crimes." 
There's just one problem: The law that <PERSON>Sen. Thurmond</PERSON> is pushing would be irrelevant in the case of the <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> restaurant murders and almost all other killings.
The pending bill, introduced by <PERSON>Mr. Thurmond</PERSON>, would revive the long-dormant federal death-penalty laws by instituting legal procedures required by the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>.
"In that sense, the whole debate is sort of a fraud," argues a Democratic <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> staff member. "It's distracting attention from serious issues, like how to make DEA, <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> and Customs work together" on drug enforcement. 
Republicans acknowledge that few people would be executed under the Thurmond bill, but they contend that isn't the point. "Many scholars are of the opinion that the mere existence of the penalty deters many people from the commission of capital crimes," says <PERSON>Sen. Orrin Hatch</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>).
<PERSON>Thomas Boyd</PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> official, says the new federal drug-related crimes punishable by death since last November may result in a jump in capital sentences, though that hasn't happened so far. 
Before the bill left committee, <PERSON>Sen. Edward Kennedy</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>) attached an amendment that would allow a defendant to escape from a death sentence in jurisdictions shown to have meted out executions in a racist manner. 
"That burden is very difficult, if not impossible, to meet," says <PERSON>Mr. Boyd</PERSON>. "How do you prove a negative?" Since most prosecutors wouldn't be able to demonstrate conclusively that racial considerations didn't affect sentencing, executions everywhere might come to a halt, <PERSON>Mr. Boyd</PERSON> explains. 
The <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION> amendment would, in effect, legislate around the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> ruling.
Lawyers would eagerly seize on the provision in their death-penalty appeals, says <PERSON>Richard Burr</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>NAACP Legal Defense</ORGANIZATION> and Educational Fund's capital-punishment defense team. 
<PERSON>Mr. Kennedy</PERSON> failed to get his amendment incorporated into last year's anti-drug legislation, and it will be severely attacked on the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> floor this time around.
As the country's new leader, <PERSON>Egon Krenz</PERSON>, prepared to travel to <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> today for talks with Soviet leader <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>, hundreds of thousands of East Germans massed in the streets of <LOCATION>Leipzig</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Halle</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Schwerin</PERSON> to call for internal freedoms and the legalization of the New Forum opposition group.
<PERSON>Krenz</PERSON>, however, vowed to preserve the <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION>'s hold on political power and said East Germans shouldn't destabilize the nation with unrealistic demands.

While the <LOCATION>Kremlin</LOCATION> has urged a ban on output of the poison gases, the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> wants to continue producing the weapons even after an international treaty calling for their destruction is signed. 
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s government said peaceful demonstrations such as the anti-apartheid rally Sunday near <LOCATION>Soweto</LOCATION> have helped ease tensions and assisted political changes.
Secretary of State <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> expressed concern that Nicaraguan President <PERSON>Ortega</PERSON> may attempt to use alleged attacks by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>backed Contra rebels as an excuse to scuttle elections scheduled for February.
<PERSON>Baker</PERSON>'s remarks came as the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> urged both sides to honor the truce.

The <ORGANIZATION>Oakland Athletics</ORGANIZATION>' four-game sweep over the <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco Giants</ORGANIZATION> in the World Series may widen already-sizable losses that the <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> network will incur on the current, final year of its baseball contract. 
The sweep by the A's, whose pitchers and home-run hitters dominated the injury-prone <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>, will only make things worse for <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>, owned by <ORGANIZATION>Capital Cities/ABC Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s baseball experience may be of interest to <ORGANIZATION>CBS Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which next season takes over the broadcasting of all baseball playoffs in a four-year television contract priced at $1.06 billion.
<ORGANIZATION>CBS Sports</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Neal Pilson</PERSON> has conceded only that <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> will have a loss in the first year.
Last year's series, broadcast by <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>, was the lowest-rated Series in four years; instead of featuring a major <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> team against a <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> team, it pitted the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Dodgers</ORGANIZATION> against the losing <ORGANIZATION>Oakland A's</ORGANIZATION>. 
RU-486 "probably represents a technical advance in an area where none is needed, or at least not very much," said <PERSON>Phillip Stubblefield</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>National Abortion Federation</ORGANIZATION>, at a reproductive health conference in 1986.
The <ORGANIZATION>Health and Human Services Department</ORGANIZATION> currently forbids the <ORGANIZATION>National Institutes of Health</ORGANIZATION> from funding abortion research as part of its $8 million contraceptive program.
But the <ORGANIZATION>Population Council</ORGANIZATION>, a 37-year-old, $20 million nonprofit organization that has the backing of the <ORGANIZATION>Rockefeller</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mellon</ORGANIZATION> foundations and currently subsidizes most <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> research on contraceptives, has recently been paying for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> studies of RU-486 on a license from its French developer, <PERSON>Roussel-Uclaf</PERSON>, a joint subsidiary of the German pharmaceutical company <ORGANIZATION>Hoechst</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> government. 
In the year since the pill went on the French market, the <ORGANIZATION>National Organization for Women</ORGANIZATION> and its offshoot, former NOW President <PERSON>Eleanor Smeal</PERSON>'s Fund for a Feminist Majority, have been trying to browbeat the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> pharmaceutical industry into getting involved. (Its scare-tactic prediction: the pill "will be available in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, either legally or illegally, in no more than 2-5 years.") 
A June 1988 article in Mother Jones magazine is typical of the general level of media ignorance. "For a woman whose period is late, using RU-486 means no waiting, no walking past picket lines at abortion clinics, and no feet up in stirrups for surgery," burbles health writer <PERSON>Laura Fraser</PERSON>. "It also means she will never have to know whether she had actually been pregnant." Wrong on all counts, <PERSON>Miss Fraser</PERSON>. 
RU-486 is being administered in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> only under strict supervision in the presence of a doctor. (<ORGANIZATION>Roussel</ORGANIZATION> reportedly has every pill marked and accounted for to make sure none slips into the black market.) Thus, a woman who used RU-486 to have an abortion would have to make three trips to the clinic past those picket lines; an initial visit for medical screening (anemics and those with previous pregnancy problems are eliminated) and to take the pill, a second trip 48 hours later for the prostaglandin, administered either via injection or vaginal suppository, and a third trip a week later to make sure she has completely aborted. 
At the behest of pro-choice members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, a four-year reauthorization bill for Title X federal family-planning assistance now contains a $10 million grant for "development, evaluation and bringing to the marketplace of new improved contraceptive devices, drugs and methods." If this passes -- a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> version has already been cleared for a floor vote that is likely early next year -- it would put the federal government into the contraceptive marketing business for the first time.
The French Economics Ministry approved a planned asset swap between the defense and electronics group Thomson-CSF <ORGANIZATION>S.A.</ORGANIZATION> and the bank group <ORGANIZATION>Credit Lyonnais</ORGANIZATION>. 
The approval also ends any hope that <PERSON>Banque Nationale</PERSON> de <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, another state-sector bank, might have had about taking <ORGANIZATION>Credit Lyonnais</ORGANIZATION>'s place in the accord.
"Due to the earthquake in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> is donating its commercial air time to broadcast <ORGANIZATION>American Red Cross Emergency Relief</ORGANIZATION> messages.
The <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> logo flashed on the screen for a moment, and then came a taped plea for donations from former President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> -- followed by the silent print telling viewers where to call.
<ORGANIZATION>Nissan Motor</ORGANIZATION> is just one of a slew of advertisers that have hitched their ads to the devastating <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> quake and Hurricane Hugo.
Along with <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Grand Metropolitan PLC</ORGANIZATION>'s Burger King and <LOCATION>New York Life Insurance</LOCATION> have tied ads to <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> donations.
Other ads don't bother with the fundraising; a touching, if self-congratulatory, <ORGANIZATION>American Telephone & Telegraph</ORGANIZATION> ad that aired Sunday intermixed footage of the devastation in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, with interviews of people recounting how <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> helped. 
At <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>, "we felt we wanted to do something to help them gather money, and we had this airtime on Monday Night Football," explains <PERSON>Brooke Mitzel</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> advertising creative manager. "What did we get out of it?
They chance alienating the customers they hope to woo by looking like opportunistic sharks. "People see extra messages in advertising, and if a manufacturer is clearly trying to get something out of it . . . if it's too transparent . . . then consumers will see through that," warns <PERSON>John Philip Jones</PERSON>, chairman of the advertising department at the <ORGANIZATION>Newhouse School of Public Communications</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Syracuse University</ORGANIZATION>. 
"It can backfire because companies can step across the line and go too far, be too pushy," agrees <PERSON>Gary Stibel</PERSON>, a principal with <ORGANIZATION>New England Consulting Group</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Westport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION> "The ultimate form of charity is when you don't tell anyone." Still, he says that only a few of the quake-related campaigns have been "tasteless" and that "the majority have been truly beneficial to the people who need the help.
Burger King's chief executive officer, <PERSON>Barry Gibbons</PERSON>, stars in ads saying that the fast-food chain will donate 25 cents to the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> for every purchase of a BK Doubles hamburger.
The campaign, which started last week and runs through Nov. 23, with funds earmarked for both the quake and Hugo, "was <PERSON>Barry</PERSON>'s idea," a spokeswoman says. "<PERSON>Barry</PERSON> felt very committed.
<ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION>'s upscale Lexus division, a sponsor of the World Series, also put in a plug for <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> donations in a World Series game it sponsored. "The World Series is brought to you by <PERSON>Lexus</PERSON>, who urges you to help relieve the suffering caused by the recent earthquake . . . ," the game announcer said.
And <LOCATION>New York Life</LOCATION> made a plea for <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> donations in newspaper ads in the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> area, latching onto the coattails of the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION>'s impeccable reputation: "The <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> has been helping people for 125 years.
<PERSON>Nancy Craig</PERSON>, advertising manager for the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION>, readily admits "they're piggybacking on our reputation." But she has no problem with that, she says: "In the meanwhile, they're helping us." The <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> doesn't track contributions raised by the disaster ads, but it has amassed $46.6 million since it first launched its hurricane relief effort Sept. 23.

When the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Soviet</ORGANIZATION> passed laws on workers' rights in May 1987 and on self-managing cooperatives a year later, some Western observers assumed <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON> had launched the Soviet Union on a course that would lead inevitably to the creation of a market economy.
These fears were clearly apparent when, last week, Secretary of State <PERSON>James Baker</PERSON> blocked a speech by <PERSON>Robert Gates</PERSON>, deputy national security adviser and Soviet expert, on the ground that it was too pessimistic about the chances of <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON>'s economic reforms succeeding. 
Along with some other revealing indicators, these developments suggest that while <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON> wishes to move away from some rigid central controls, he is bent on creating economic structures of a kind that would scarcely find favor with the Austrian or <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> schools of economic thought.
The emergence of <LOCATION>Russian</LOCATION> corporatism had been anticipated in journalist <ORGANIZATION>George Urban</ORGANIZATION>'s introduction to a series of colloquies -- "Can the Soviet System Survive Reform?" -- published this spring. "Communism will reach its final stage of development in a feckless <LOCATION>Russo</LOCATION> -- corporation-socialist in form, nationalistic in content and <ORGANIZATION>Oriental</ORGANIZATION> in style -- that will puzzle the world with alternating feats of realism and recklessness. . . ." 
The closeness of Soviet perestroika to the fascist social blueprint of <PERSON>Mussolini</PERSON> was evident when <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON> presented his economic vision to the Soviet Congress.
<PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON> is in a much stronger position to pursue the corporatist ideal than was <PERSON>Mussolini</PERSON>, who was never able to influence business giants such as <ORGANIZATION>Pirelli</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Fiat</ORGANIZATION>.
The most important development in <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON>'s policy for marginalizing the opposition movement is the claim that the <LOCATION>U.S.S.R.</LOCATION> also suffers from terrorism.
An increasing number of references by the Soviet press to opposition groups now active in the <LOCATION>U.S.S.R.</LOCATION>, particularly the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Union</ORGANIZATION>, allege that they show "terroristic tendencies" and claim that they would be prepared to kill in order to achieve their aims.
<PERSON>Miss Brady</PERSON> is deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION>Russian Research Foundation</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Treasury Department</ORGANIZATION> proposed that banks be required to keep detailed records of international wire transfers, which officials believe is the main vehicle used by drug traffickers to move billions of dollars in and out of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
In recent testimony on <LOCATION>Capitol Hill</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> officials said they were considering the new reporting requirements, and the expected publication of the proposal in the Federal Register today is the first official step toward creating final regulations.
<PERSON>Sen. John Kerry</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>), chairman of a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations subcommittee that oversees the issue of money laundering, criticized the proposal for ignoring wire transfers between foreign banks that are executed and cleared on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> wire systems.
In yesterday's composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Louisiana-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at $39.25, down 37.5 cents. 
<PERSON>Pierre Peladeau</PERSON>, a Canadian newspaper publisher little-known in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, figures to become a big player in <LOCATION>North American</LOCATION> printing -- and his ambitions don't end there. 
Yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Quebecor Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> printing, publishing and forest-products company 53%-owned by <PERSON>Mr. Peladeau</PERSON>, agreed to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Maxwell Communication Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> printing subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION>Maxwell Graphics Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, for $500 million in cash and securities.
The purchase, expected to be completed by year end, will make Quebecor the second-largest commercial printer in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, behind only <ORGANIZATION>R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. 
The printing customers that <ORGANIZATION>Quebecor</ORGANIZATION> will gain through <ORGANIZATION>Maxwell Graphics</ORGANIZATION> include the Sunday newspaper supplement Parade, <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION>, Sports Illustrated and <ORGANIZATION>TV Guide</ORGANIZATION>. 
But the transaction is just <PERSON>Mr. Peladeau</PERSON>'s latest step in a larger design: to build Quebecor through acquisitions into an integrated paper, publishing and printing concern with a reach throughout <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>.
Analysts say <ORGANIZATION>Quebecor</ORGANIZATION>'s purchase is part of a trend toward consolidation in the <LOCATION>North American</LOCATION> printing industry.
Along with <PERSON>Donnelley</PERSON>, says <PERSON>Jacques Massicotte</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION>, "Quebecor has positioned itself as one of the two key players." He adds: "I think this is a great strategic move for Quebecor.
<PERSON>Mr. Peladeau</PERSON> says he isn't trying to catch up to <LOCATION>Donnelley</LOCATION>, which has annual sales of over $3 billion. "Size doesn't matter," <PERSON>Mr. Peladeau</PERSON> says. "What counts is the bottom line." 
Some of <PERSON>Mr. Peladeau</PERSON>'s ventures, including an earlier push into the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market, haven't paid off on the bottom line.
Quebecor still lags in the Quebec circulars market, while <PERSON>Mr. Peladeau</PERSON>'s former employees are expanding across <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Peladeau</PERSON> took his first big gamble 25 years ago, when he took advantage of a strike at <ORGANIZATION>La Presse</ORGANIZATION>, then <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION>'s dominant French-language newspaper, to launch the <ORGANIZATION>Journal de Montreal</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Peladeau</PERSON> has never made any apologies for publishing the tabloid, a brash mix of crime and sports. "I've read <PERSON>Balzac</PERSON>," he answers critics. "It's tabloid news from A to Z." 
Quebecor also publishes a second tabloid in <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION>, the struggling 18-month-old <ORGANIZATION>Montreal Daily News</ORGANIZATION>; dailies in <LOCATION>Quebec City</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Winnipeg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Manitoba</LOCATION>; and dozens of weeklies covering most of <LOCATION>Quebec</LOCATION>.
Finally, with <ORGANIZATION>Maxwell Communication</ORGANIZATION>, the company controls 54% of <ORGANIZATION>Donohue Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Quebec City</LOCATION> pulp and paper concern. 
In yesterday's accord, <ORGANIZATION>Quebecor</ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay $400 million in cash for <ORGANIZATION>Maxwell Graphics</ORGANIZATION>, and to give <ORGANIZATION>Maxwell Communication</ORGANIZATION> a 20% stake, valued at $100 million, in <LOCATION>Quebecor</LOCATION>'s new printing subsidiary.
The new, as yet unnamed, subsidiary will combine <ORGANIZATION>Quebecor</ORGANIZATION>'s existing printing unit and <ORGANIZATION>Maxwell Graphics</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Pierre-Karl Peladeau</PERSON>, the founder's son and the executive in charge of the acquisition, says <ORGANIZATION>Quebecor</ORGANIZATION> hasn't decided how it will finance its share of the purchase, but he says it most likely will use debt. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Maxwell</ORGANIZATION> deal is <ORGANIZATION>Quebecor</ORGANIZATION>'s second big printing acquisition in just over a year.
Last October, <PERSON>Quebecor</PERSON> bought 23 Canadian printing plants from <ORGANIZATION>BCE Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> telecommunications, manufacturing, energy and real estate company.
<ORGANIZATION>Maxwell</ORGANIZATION>'s sale of its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> printing unit was expected, the last major business to be disposed of in a major reshuffling of assets.
According to its most recent annual report, covering the 15 months ended March 31, <ORGANIZATION>Maxwell Communication</ORGANIZATION> bought $3.85 billion in assets -- including <ORGANIZATION>Macmillan Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Official Airlines Guides</ORGANIZATION> -- and sold $2 billion in non-strategic businesses.
Now, <ORGANIZATION>Maxwell</ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON>Robert Maxwell</PERSON> says he has an appetite for new acquisitions in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, adding that he could spend "a good deal more" than $1 billion on another <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> purchase. 
In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Maxwell Communication</ORGANIZATION> shares rose nine pence, to 216 pence ($3.41). 
In <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Quebecor</ORGANIZATION>'s multiple voting Class A stock closed at C$16.375 (US$13.94), down 12.5 Canadian cents.

<ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> is planning to build a new engine plant in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> that may be built in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, provided the company can reach a satisfactory agreement with unions, sources said. 
Officials of <ORGANIZATION>Vauxhall Motors Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s British unit, were meeting with union leaders late yesterday in hopes of winning such an accord.

The question is at the root of a brawl between <ORGANIZATION>Humana Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the big for-profit hospital and insurance company, and its not-for-profit brethren in its home state of <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>. 
The law has prevented $216 million of unnecessary expenditures since 1986, according to <PERSON>William S. Conn</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Kentucky Hospital Association</ORGANIZATION>. 
But according to <PERSON>David Jones</PERSON>, <PERSON>Humana</PERSON>'s chief executive, it promotes technology monopolies, stifles innovation and raises prices. 
If the <ORGANIZATION>Legislature</ORGANIZATION> doesn't repeal the law, due for revision in 1990, <PERSON>Mr. Jones</PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION>Humana</ORGANIZATION> may move its insurance operations, including 3,000 jobs in <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>, to another state. 
<PERSON>Mr. Conn</PERSON> charges that <LOCATION>Humana</LOCATION>'s own actions undermine its argument.
When a hospital in <LOCATION>Lexington</LOCATION> installed a lithotripter last year, demand for a similar kidney-stone smashing machine at a <LOCATION>Humana</LOCATION> hospital in <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION> fell 34%.
The <LOCATION>Humana</LOCATION> hospital responded by jacking up prices to make up for lost revenue, <PERSON>Mr. Conn</PERSON> says, and now charges as much as $8,000 for the procedure, which costs only about $3,500 in <LOCATION>Lexington</LOCATION>. 
"Ten years ago, a physician would go to a town and take out a loan (to start a practice)," says <PERSON>James Merritt</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Merritt, Hawkins & Associates</ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, physician recruiter that conducted the survey. "They won't do that very often today at all.

The 12-bed "cooperative care" unit is one of about 18 nationwide where a family member or friend helps care for a patient in the hospital. "The philosophy is to make the patient and the family very responsible for a portion of their own care," says <PERSON>Anthony J. Grieco</PERSON>, medical director of cooperative care at <ORGANIZATION>New York University Medical Center</ORGANIZATION>, where the concept began 10 years ago. "It helps us, and them, while they're here, and it certainly makes them a better health-care team when they get home." 
The approach has generated so much interest that <ORGANIZATION>NYU</ORGANIZATION> is host to the first conference on cooperative care Nov. 30. "It's really part of the hospital of the 21st century," <PERSON>Dr. Grieco</PERSON> says.

President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said that three members of his cabinet will lead a presidential mission to <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> to gauge how the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> can help the new non-Communist government's economic changes. 
The mission will visit <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> from Nov. 29 to Dec. 2, the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> said. 
In remarks at a <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> ceremony marking Polish <ORGANIZATION>Heritage Month</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> announced that Agriculture Secretary <PERSON>Clayton Yeutter</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Robert Mosbacher</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Labor</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Elizabeth Dole</PERSON> will lead the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> group.
<PERSON>Michael Boskin</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Council of Economic Advisers</ORGANIZATION>, also will be a member. 
In addition, the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> said that <PERSON>Charles Harper</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>ConAgra Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>John McGillicuddy</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Manufacturers Hanover Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, will be among a group of at least 15 business and labor representatives in the presidential mission.
<PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> said the group is to "focus on economic sectors where <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> expertise and cooperation can indeed make a difference." 
<PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> has asked <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to provide more than $400 million in economic aid and food grants for <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>'s new government, but has been chided by Democrats for failing to do more. 
A state judge postponed a decision on a move by holders of <ORGANIZATION>Telerate Inc.</ORGANIZATION> to block the tender offer of <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones & Co.</ORGANIZATION> for the 33% of <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> it doesn't already own. 
Vice Chancellor <PERSON>Maurice A. Hartnett III</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Delaware's Court of Chancery</ORGANIZATION> heard arguments for more than two hours here, but he made no comment and asked no questions.
<ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> has offered to pay $18 a share, or about $576 million, for the remaining <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> stake.
<PERSON>Robert Kornreich</PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> holders, told <PERSON>Judge Hartnett</PERSON> the <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> offer is "arrogant" and "hostile." He accused <PERSON>Dow Jones</PERSON> of "using unfair means to obtain the stock at an unfair price." 
<PERSON>Michael Rauch</PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION>, defended the offer as adequate, based on what the company considers realistic projections of <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION>'s revenue growth, in the range of 12%.
Many investors give <PERSON>Michael Foods</PERSON> about as much chance of getting it together as <ORGANIZATION>Humpty Dumpty</ORGANIZATION>.
Two <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION> shareholder suits in the past month have accused top officers of making "various untrue statements." These federal-court suits accuse the officers of failing to disclose that Easy Eggs were unlikely to sell briskly enough to justify all of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON>'s production capacity. 
The <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> fast-food chain, owned by Grand Metropolitan of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, expects to consume roughly 34 million pounds of liquefied eggs annually. 
Perhaps to debunk the analysts' talk of over-capacity, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> today will take some of the skeptics on a tour of its new <LOCATION>Gaylord</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minn.</LOCATION>, plant. 
The extent of <ORGANIZATION>Marriott</ORGANIZATION>'s use isn't known, and <ORGANIZATION>Marriott</ORGANIZATION> officials couldn't be reached for comment. 
"The stock, in my opinion, is going to go lower, not only because of disappointing earnings but {because} the credibility gap is certainly not closing," says <PERSON>L. Craig Carver</PERSON> of <PERSON>Dain Bosworth</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Carver</PERSON> says that at a recent Dain-sponsored conference in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, he asked <PERSON>Michael</PERSON>'s chief executive officer if the fourth quarter would be down.
Analyst <ORGANIZATION>Robin Young of John Kinnard & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, calls himself "the last remaining bull on the stock." He argues that <PERSON>Michael Foods</PERSON> is misunderstood: "This is a growth company in the packaged food industry -- a rare breed, like finding a white rhino." Earnings aren't keeping pace, he says, because of heavy investments in the egg technologies and drought-related costs in its potato business. 
Last week a closely held <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> concern, <ORGANIZATION>Papetti High-Grade Egg Products Co.</ORGANIZATION>, rolled out an aseptically packaged liquefied item called Table Ready.
Company President <PERSON>Steve Papetti</PERSON> says <PERSON>Marriott</PERSON> will be among his clients as well. 
Says New York-based short seller <PERSON>Mark Cohodes</PERSON>, "In my mind this is a $7 stock." <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> late yesterday announced a $3.8 million stock buy-back program. 
But dry growing conditions in the <LOCATION>Red River Valley of Minnesota</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> are pushing spot prices of potatoes beyond what <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> contracted to pay last spring.
Secretary of <ORGANIZATION>State Baker</ORGANIZATION>, we read, decided to kill a speech that <PERSON>Robert Gates</PERSON>, deputy national security adviser and a career Soviet expert, was going to give to a student colloquium, the <ORGANIZATION>National Collegiate Security Conference</ORGANIZATION>.
So far as we can see, there is no disagreement among <PERSON>Mr. Baker</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Quayle</PERSON>, the <PERSON>Mr. Gates</PERSON> we've read, or for that matter President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>.
They all understand point one: Nothing the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> can do will make much difference in whether <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON> succeeds with perestroika.
Perhaps <PERSON>Mr. Gates</PERSON> would emphasize more than <PERSON>Mr. Baker</PERSON> the many hurdles the Soviet leader must leap if he is going to succeed.
<ORGANIZATION>GATT</ORGANIZATION> membership will not matter to <LOCATION>Donbas</LOCATION> coal miners short of soap, nor will a START treaty make any difference to <LOCATION>Ukrainian</LOCATION> nationalists. 
On the other hand, so long as <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON> is easing his grip on his empire, everyone we've heard agrees that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> can benefit by engaging him.
Yet much of the political culture seems intent on castigating the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration for not "helping" <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr. Baker</PERSON> seems especially sensitive to the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> ailment known as Beltway-itis.
Its symptoms include a cold sweat at the sound of debate, clammy hands in the face of congressional criticism, and fainting spells when someone writes the word "controversy." As one unidentified official clearly in the late stages of the disease told the Times: "<PERSON>Baker</PERSON> just felt that there were some lines in the speech that could be misinterpreted and seized by the press." In short, the problem is not intra-administration disagreement, but preoccupation with the prospect that perestrokia might fail, and its political opponents will ask "Who lost <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>?" 
<PERSON>Mr. Baker</PERSON> may want to avoid criticism from <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON>George Mitchell</PERSON>, but as Secretary of State his audience is the entire Free World, not just <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
In any case, he's likely to find that the more he muzzles his colleagues, the more leaks will pop up all around <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, a lesson once learned by <PERSON>Henry Kissinger</PERSON>.
We note that in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> yesterday <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Cheney</PERSON> said that European euphoria over <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON> is starting to be tempered by a recognition of "the magnitude of the problems he was trying to deal with." 
Despite warnings from such leaders as former <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Board</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>William McChesney Martin</PERSON> that unfixed commissions would undo the industry, the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> in September 1973 said full competition must start May l, 1975. 
Ray <PERSON>Garrett Jr.</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> chairman, said the "breadth and depth of the discounting is more than I expected." Even a federal measure in June allowing houses to add research fees to their commissions didn't stop it. 
It came in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s "Big Bang" 1986 deregulation; and <ORGANIZATION>Toronto</ORGANIZATION>'s "Little Bang" the same year.
The major question, said one holder who asked not to be named, is whether <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Bennett S. LeBow</PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION>Brooke Partners</ORGANIZATION> controls <ORGANIZATION>Western Union</ORGANIZATION>, is willing to offer a large enough equity stake to entice bondholders into agreeing to a new swap. 
Just when <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> liberalism had pulled the arms plug on the Contras and their friend <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>, along comes <PERSON>Mr. Ortega</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> this weekend to "blunder" into the hands of what are often called conservatives.
Conservatives are the faction in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> politics which always said that <PERSON>Mr. Ortega</PERSON> and his friends don't want to hold an election in <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>.
He knows that making <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> look silly in a photograph with him will trigger <LOCATION>Noriegan</LOCATION> fulminations, and that announcing an end to the liberals' cease-fire will produce mainly their concern over the Contras' military activities in northern <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>.
It is the presence of internal and external "enemies" which justifies the need for a large, active army that <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> continues to supply with bullets. 
Profit-taking accounted for much of the slide in <ORGANIZATION>OTC</ORGANIZATION> stock prices, according to <PERSON>David Mills</PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Boston Company Advisers</ORGANIZATION>.
"The profit locking-in is definitely going on," said <PERSON>Mr. Mills</PERSON>, whose firm manages $600 million for <ORGANIZATION>Boston Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
The selling by money managers and individual investors is turning traders bearish as well. "We are advising a lot of our clients to make moves that make sense to them, rather than waiting until the last minute, because things have been so volatile," said <PERSON>William Sulya</PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION>OTC</ORGANIZATION> trading at <ORGANIZATION>A.G. Edwards & Sons</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Ralph Costanza</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>OTC</ORGANIZATION> trading department at <ORGANIZATION>Smith Barney</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Harris Upham</ORGANIZATION>, said many market players are awaiting some resolution of the current debate over program trading. 
<ORGANIZATION>Weisfield</ORGANIZATION>'s surged 14 to 53 after agreeing in principle to be acquired by a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Ratners Group</ORGANIZATION> for $50 a share.
<ORGANIZATION>Ratners</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Weisfield</ORGANIZATION>'s said they expect to sign definitive agreements shortly and to complete the transaction by Dec. 15. 
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> assumed its recently customary place on the OTC most active list as its <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> depository receipts gained 1/4 to 11 7/8 on volume of 1.2 million shares and <ORGANIZATION>Daimler-Benz</ORGANIZATION> joined the list of companies interested in the British car maker.
<PERSON>Daimler</PERSON> said it has had talks with <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> about possible joint ventures. 
Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor</ORGANIZATION> continue their pursuit of the company.
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> has acquired more than 13% of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s shares, and <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> has received <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> regulatory clearance to buy 15%. 
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Inc.</ORGANIZATION> are discussing formation of a group to sell securities-price data. 
The spokeswoman said the move isn't directly a response to <ORGANIZATION>Quotron</ORGANIZATION>'s loss of its two biggest customers, <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>American Express Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, to <ORGANIZATION>Automated Data Processing Inc.</ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. 
The spokeswoman noted that last week, <ORGANIZATION>Kidder, Peabody & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the securities subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION>, chose a <LOCATION>Quotron</LOCATION> subsidiary to provide order-processing services.
And Oct. 24, <PERSON>Quotron</PERSON> said it will market the automated trading system of broker-dealer <ORGANIZATION>Chapdelaine Government Securities Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
Quotron isn't profitable on <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>'s books because of the interest charges the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> bank holding company incurred in buying the financial-data concern for $680 million, says <PERSON>Ronald I. Mandle</PERSON>, analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Sanford C. Bernstein & Co</ORGANIZATION>.
This past summer, <ORGANIZATION>Quotron</ORGANIZATION> sold its customer-service unit, employing 600, to <ORGANIZATION>Phoenix Technologies Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a closely held computer-service firm in <LOCATION>Valley Forge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>DPC</ORGANIZATION>, an investor group led by New York-based <ORGANIZATION>Crescott Investment Associates</ORGANIZATION>, had itself filed a suit in state court in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> seeking to nullify the agreement.
Earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION>Dataproducts</ORGANIZATION> had rejected a $15 a share offer from <ORGANIZATION>DPC</ORGANIZATION>, saying it wasn't adequately financed.
<ORGANIZATION>DPC</ORGANIZATION> last week launched a new, $10-a-share offer for the <LOCATION>Woodland Hills</LOCATION>, Calif.-based computer printer maker. 
<PERSON>Mr. Jordan</PERSON> has served as executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>United Negro College Fund</ORGANIZATION>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Voter Education Project of the Southern Regional Council</ORGANIZATION> and attorney-consultant to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity</ORGANIZATION>.
<LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> -- $813.4 million of general obligation bonds, Fiscal 1990 Series C and D, including $757.4 million of tax-exempt bonds and $56 million of taxable bonds, tentatively priced by a <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs & Co.</ORGANIZATION> group.
<ORGANIZATION>Collateralized Mortgage Securities Corp.</ORGANIZATION> -- $150 million of Remic mortgage securities offered in 12 classes by <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
The offering, Series 1989-3, is by a company established by <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION> for issuing <ORGANIZATION>Remics</ORGANIZATION> and other derivative mortgage securities.
<ORGANIZATION>Beneficial Corp.</ORGANIZATION> -- $248.3 million of securities backed by home-equity loans through <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ORGANIZATION>.
The offering is rated triple-A by <ORGANIZATION>Moody's</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION>, based on the quality of the underlying home equity loans and a letter of credit covering 10% of the deal from <ORGANIZATION>Union Bank of Switzerland</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Rochester Community Savings Bank</ORGANIZATION> -- $200 million of 8.85% certificates backed by automobile loans priced to yield 8.99% via <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
The issue, through <ORGANIZATION>RCSB</ORGANIZATION> 1989-A Grantor Trust, was priced at a yield spread of 100 basis points above the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> 7 3/4% note due July 1991.
The issue is rated triple-A by <ORGANIZATION>Moody's</ORGANIZATION>, based on the quality of the underlying auto loans and a letter of credit covering 13% of the deal from <ORGANIZATION>Credit Suisse</ORGANIZATION>. 
South Australian Government <ORGANIZATION>Finance Authority</ORGANIZATION> (agency) -- 125 million Australian dollars of zero-coupon Eurobonds due Dec. 12, 1994, priced at 50.9375 to yield 15.06% less fees via <ORGANIZATION>Hambros Bank Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. Guaranteed by the <ORGANIZATION>South Australian Treasury</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Government Insurance Office of New South Wales</ORGANIZATION> (agency) -- A$50 million of 17 1/2% Eurobonds due Dec. 4, 1991, priced at 101.95 to yield 17.06 less fees via <ORGANIZATION>Westpac Banking Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Fees 1 1/4. 
<ORGANIZATION>Swedish Export Credit Corp.</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>) -- 100 million Swiss francs of 6 1/8% privately placed notes due Sept. 30, 1996, priced at 100 3/4 to yield 5.99% via <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp Investment Bank Switzerland</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON>Lee A. Iacocca</PERSON> said the nation's No. 3 auto maker will need to close one or two of its assembly plants because of the slowdown hitting the industry. 
In an interview with the trade journal <ORGANIZATION>Automotive News</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Iacocca</PERSON> declined to say which plants will close or when <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> will make the moves.
According to industry analysts, <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> plants most likely to close are the <ORGANIZATION>St. Louis No.</ORGANIZATION> 1 facility, which builds <PERSON>Chrysler LeBaron</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Dodge Daytona</ORGANIZATION> models; the <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, Jeep plant, which dates back to the early 1900s; and two Canadian plants that build the Jeep Wrangler and <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION>'s full-sized vans. 
<ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> has had to temporarily close the <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION> plants recently because of excess inventories of vehicles built there. 
At <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION>'s 1990 model preview last month, <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Motors</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Robert A. Lutz</PERSON> said the No. 3 auto maker, along with other <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> manufacturers, might be forced to "realign . . . capacity" if market demand doesn't improve.
<ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> has signaled that as many as five of its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Canadian plants may not survive the mid-1990s as it struggles to trim its excess vehicle-production capacity. 
With companies such as <ORGANIZATION>Honda Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Toyota Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Nissan Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> running so-called transplant auto operations, Japanese auto production in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> will reach one million vehicles this year. 
Already <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> has closed the <LOCATION>Kenosha</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION>, plant it acquired when it bought <ORGANIZATION>American Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in 1987.
<ORGANIZATION>Mitsui</ORGANIZATION> expects the antibiotic products to be exported to <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Revco D.S. Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the drugstore chain that filed for bankruptcy-court protection last year, received a $925 million offer from a group led by <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON>Robert Bass</PERSON>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Revco</ORGANIZATION> insists that the proposal is simply an "expression of interest," because under Chapter 11 <ORGANIZATION>Revco</ORGANIZATION> has "exclusivity rights" until Feb. 28.
A financial adviser for <ORGANIZATION>Revco</ORGANIZATION> bondholders, <PERSON>David Schulte</PERSON>, of Chilmark Partners, had mixed reactions to the offer. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Revco</ORGANIZATION> bonds are high-yield, high-risk "junk" bonds; holders have $750 million in claims against <ORGANIZATION>Revco</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Schulte</PERSON> said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Acadia Partners Limited Partnership</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Fort Worth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, partnership that includes the <PERSON>Robert M. Bass Group</PERSON>, made the proposal.
<PERSON>Mr. Bass</PERSON> is based in <LOCATION>Fort Worth</LOCATION>. 
"If bought at the right price, it could still be profitable," said <PERSON>Jeffrey Stein</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>McDonald & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>. 
Last week, <ORGANIZATION>Revco</ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION>Anac Holding Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said the company reported a loss of $16.2 million for the fiscal first quarter, compared with a loss of $27.9 million in the year-earlier quarter.
The company, based in <LOCATION>Twinsburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, said its operating profit before depreciation and amortization increased 51%, to $9.2 million from $6.1 million. 
<ORGANIZATION>Acadia Partners</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Bass Group</ORGANIZATION> declined to comment.
The partnership also includes <ORGANIZATION>American Express Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Revco</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, <PERSON>Boake A. Sells</PERSON>, said both the company and the bondholders have put forth reorganization plans, but little progress has been made since negotiations began this summer. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Schulte</PERSON>, the bondholders' adviser, said <ORGANIZATION>Revco</ORGANIZATION> was dragging its feet in responding to the proposal. "They want to pretend it doesn't exist," he said. 
<PERSON>Mr. Schulte</PERSON>, who met with <LOCATION>Acadia</LOCATION> representatives on Oct. 10, said, "It's certainly a responsible offer.
<ORGANIZATION>The Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> let stand a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> court's ruling that the manufacturers of a drug once used to prevent miscarriages must share liability for injuries or deaths when the maker of an individual dose is unknown. 
The <ORGANIZATION>New York Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> ruling parallels a 1980 decision by the <ORGANIZATION>California Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> requiring shared liability among manufacturers for injuries when it can't be determined which company is at fault.
<PERSON>Paul Rheingold</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> lawyer who represents DES victims, said that before the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> ruling, only the states of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> had followed the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> decision.
"Generally, when <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> go one way, it has a tremendous influence on other states, especially small ones," said <PERSON>Mr. Rheingold</PERSON>.
The high court refused to hear appeals by <ORGANIZATION>Rexall Drug Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which went out of business in 1987 and was taken over by <ORGANIZATION>RXDC Liquidating Trust</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>E.R. Squibb & Sons Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Squibb Corp.</ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION>Eli Lilly & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
<LOCATION>Tigue</LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION>E.R. Squibb & Sons Inc.</ORGANIZATION> vs.
<PERSON>Hymowitz</PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION>Eli Lilly & Co.</ORGANIZATION> vs.
But last February, a federal appeals court in <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> upheld a damage award against <ORGANIZATION>General Dynamics</ORGANIZATION>, rejecting the company's use of the government contractor defense.
<ORGANIZATION>General Dynamics</ORGANIZATION> was sued by the families of five <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> divers who were killed in 1982 after they re-entered a submarine through a diving chamber.
-- Let stand the mail fraud and conspiracy conviction of <PERSON>John Lavery</PERSON>, a former vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Beech-Nut Nutrition Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Nestle S.A.</ORGANIZATION>
-- Left intact an award of $1.5 million in damages against <ORGANIZATION>Dow Chemical Co.</ORGANIZATION> in the death of an <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> man from exposure to Agent Orange.
The award was made by a federal court to the widow of a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> employee who contracted <PERSON>Hodgkin</PERSON>'s disease after using herbicides containing Agent Orange in a weed-killing program. (<ORGANIZATION>Dow Chemical Co.</ORGANIZATION> vs.
<ORGANIZATION>Mercury Savings & Loan Association</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Huntington Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, reported a third-quarter loss of $3.9 million, or 61 cents a share, compared with net income of $1.4 million, or 22 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. 
Such a focus is "more profitable, more efficient and gives us a greater sense of control," said <PERSON>William A. Shane</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mercury</PERSON>'s senior executive vice president.
The collapse of a $6.79 billion labor-management buy-out of <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION> may not stop some of Wall Street's top talent from collecting up to $53.7 million in fees. 
According to one person familiar with the airline, the buy-out group -- led by <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION>'s pilots union and <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Stephen Wolf</PERSON> -- has begun billing <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> for fees and expenses it owes to investment bankers, law firms and banks. 
The tab even covers $8 million in commitment fees owed to <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Chase Manhattan Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, even though their failure to obtain $7.2 billion in bank loans for the buy-out was the main reason for its collapse. 
The merger agreement says the buy-out group is entitled to be repaid $26.7 million in fees for its investment bankers, <ORGANIZATION>Lazard Freres & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, and its law firm, <ORGANIZATION>Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison</ORGANIZATION>. 
In addition to the $8 million for <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Chase</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers</ORGANIZATION> is also owed $3 million for promising to make a $200 million bridge loan. 
Separately, <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stock rose $4 a share to $175 in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> on reports that <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON> has asked <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION> unions if they're interested in cooperating with <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON> in a new bid for <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>. 
But neither the pilots nor the machinists appear interested, and <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON> is barred from making a new bid under terms of an agreement he made with <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> in September unless <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> accepts an offer below $300 a share. 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s exports of cars, trucks and buses declined 2.4% to 535,322 units in September from a year earlier, the <ORGANIZATION>Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association</ORGANIZATION> said. 
The <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> regions were unchanged. 
A small decline in total construction for the entire year is possible if contracting for housing doesn't increase in response to this year's lower mortgage rates, said <PERSON>George A. Christie</PERSON>, vice president and chief economist of <ORGANIZATION>Dodge</ORGANIZATION>, the forecasting division of publisher <ORGANIZATION>McGraw-Hill Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>James River Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, said it acquired the tissue operations of <ORGANIZATION>Buhrmann-Tetterode N.V.</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION> for about $77 million. 
The Dutch unit, known as <ORGANIZATION>Celtona B.V.</ORGANIZATION>, is a leading maker of consumer and away-from-home tissue products for the <LOCATION>Benelux</LOCATION> region.
In addition, the acquisition includes production assets of <ORGANIZATION>Invercon Papermils</ORGANIZATION>, a maker of household tissue products for the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>James River</PERSON>, a maker of pulp, paper and plastic products, already has interests in tissue businesses in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Allianz</PERSON> said it won French government approval to buy as much as one-third of <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION>, a diversified financial, transport and food holding company.
The move comes a week after <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> announced that it was preparing to bid for 66.7% control of <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION>. 
Munich-based <PERSON>Allianz</PERSON>'s brief explanatory statement said it is acting to protect its own interests as a shareholder of <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION>.
That would be a blow to both <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION>.
Each had claimed <PERSON>Allianz</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s largest insurance company, as a tacit ally. 
It led to broad market speculation that <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> now will sweeten its bid, which is expected to be formally launched later this week, after approval from <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> government regulators. 
<PERSON>Allianz</PERSON>'s entry reflects the increasing eagerness of West German companies, looking ahead to the reduction in European Community internal barriers in 1992, to get involved in what until now were considered internal <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> affairs.
<ORGANIZATION>Deutsche Bank</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Dresdner Bank</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Commerzbank</ORGANIZATION> all also have expressed eagerness to expand in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> before 1992. 
<ORGANIZATION>Dresdner Bank</ORGANIZATION> this month moved to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Banque Internationale</ORGANIZATION> des Placements, a small <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> merchant bank that <ORGANIZATION>Deutsche Bank</ORGANIZATION> had looked at and passed over.
<ORGANIZATION>Commerzbank</ORGANIZATION> had hoped to buy a stake in <ORGANIZATION>Credit Lyonnais</ORGANIZATION>, until the Socialists returned to government last year and canceled plans to privatize the large French bank.
<ORGANIZATION>Deutsche Bank</ORGANIZATION> has actively sought a <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> acquisition for at least two years.
Lately, analysts say, <ORGANIZATION>Deutsche Bank</ORGANIZATION> has shocked some in the <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> financial community by indicating it wants a strong bank with a large number of branches. 
"We are still looking," said a <ORGANIZATION>Deutsche Bank</ORGANIZATION> spokesman. "The banks we think would fit into our concept are either government-owned or not for sale, though <ORGANIZATION>Deutsche Bank</ORGANIZATION> would be able to pay a good price." 
While <ORGANIZATION>Allianz</ORGANIZATION> officials weren't willing to comment in any detail on their plans, they said <PERSON>Allianz</PERSON> currently holds between 5% and 10% of <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION>, an apparent increase from the 5% stake that <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> officials had earlier announced.
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> market sources said they believed <PERSON>Allianz</PERSON> was buying yesterday morning, and <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> moved up 108 francs ($17.19) to close at 1,908 francs in heavy trading.
It was the first day of trading following the suspension of <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> shares last Monday, when <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> announced its plan to pay 1,850 francs for each <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> share. 
<ORGANIZATION>Allianz</ORGANIZATION> also holds a 50% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION>'s insurance subsidiary, one of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s largest insurance groups, which it bought for about 6.5 billion francs just before <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> launched its bid.
<ORGANIZATION>Allianz</ORGANIZATION> said in its statement that it was acting to protect that interest, which ties it to <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> as a partner. 
<PERSON>Allianz</PERSON>'s statement stressed the company's previously announced position that <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION>'s offer price is too low.
<PERSON>Allianz</PERSON> also suggested, without saying so directly, that it regrets that <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> isn't bidding for all of <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION>'s shares.
The problem here, analysts say, is that if <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> wins its 66.7%, remaining <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> shares will fall in value.
That displeases many current holders, such as <ORGANIZATION>Allianz</ORGANIZATION>, which couldn't be sure of selling all their shares if they tendered to <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Allianz</ORGANIZATION> statement led to speculation that <PERSON>Allianz</PERSON> eventually could sell to <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION>.
That would be bad news for <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION>'s current management, which was counting on <PERSON>Allianz</PERSON> to help fend off <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> currently intends to offer 1,850 francs a share for <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> shares that receive full dividends this year.
Alternatively, it would offer to swap three <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> shares for one <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> share.
<ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> already holds about 18.7% of <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION>, and the acquisition of the additional 48% would cost it about 11 billion francs under its current bid. 
The bid values <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> at around 23 billion francs, depending on how many holders of <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> warrants exchange them for shares before the bid expires. 
The biotechnology concern said the agreement between its longtime West German distributor, <ORGANIZATION>Boehringer-Ingleheim</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Dr. Karl Thomae</PERSON> G.m.b.
H. subsidiary, and <ORGANIZATION>Hoechst</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Behringwerke</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary was an attempt to expand the market for blood-clot drugs in general. 
A <ORGANIZATION>Genentech</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said the agreement calls for <ORGANIZATION>Hoechst</ORGANIZATION> to promote <ORGANIZATION>TPA</ORGANIZATION> for heart patients and streptokinase for other clot-reducing purposes. 
<ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it lowered ratings on long-term debt of <ORGANIZATION>CS First Boston Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the holding company of <LOCATION>Wall Street</LOCATION> giant <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, because of <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION>'s "aggressive merchant banking risk" in highly leveraged takeovers. 
In downgrading <ORGANIZATION>CS First Boston</ORGANIZATION>'s subordinated domestic, Euromarket and Swiss debt to single-A-3 from single-A-2, <ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION>'s is matching a move made by the other major credit rating concern, <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor's Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, several months ago.
<ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION>'s also confirmed the Prime-1 rating, its highest, on <ORGANIZATION>CS First Boston</ORGANIZATION>'s commercial paper, or short-term corporate IOUs. 
In addition, <ORGANIZATION>Moody's</ORGANIZATION> said it downgraded <ORGANIZATION>Financiere Credit Suisse-First Boston</ORGANIZATION>'s senior and subordinated Swiss debt to single-A-2 from single-A-1 and lowered Financiere <ORGANIZATION>CSFB N.V.</ORGANIZATION>'s junior subordinated perpetual Eurodebt, guaranteed by <ORGANIZATION>Financiere Credit Suisse</ORGANIZATION> -- <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION>, to single-A-3 from single-A-2.
<ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION>'s merchant banking risks mounted last month as highly leveraged <ORGANIZATION>Campeau Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION>'s most lucrative client of the decade, was hit by a cash squeeze and the high-risk junk bond market tumbled.
<ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION> incurred millions of dollars of losses on <ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION> securities it owned as well as on special securities it couldn't sell.
<ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION> financings for several other highly leveraged clients, including <PERSON>Ohio Mattress</PERSON>, unraveled as the high-risk junk bond market plummeted. 
<ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION>'s said its rating changes actions "reflect <ORGANIZATION>CS First Boston</ORGANIZATION>'s aggressive merchant banking risk as well as the risk profile of its current merchant banking exposures." It said <ORGANIZATION>CS First Boston</ORGANIZATION> "has consistently been one of the most aggressive firms in merchant banking" and that "a very significant portion" of the firm's profit in recent years has come from merchant banking-related business. 
"<ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION>'s believes that the uncertain environment for merchant banking could put pressure on <ORGANIZATION>CS First Boston</ORGANIZATION>'s performance," the rating concern said, citing "continued problems" from the firm's exposures to "various Campeau-related firms" and to <ORGANIZATION>Ohio Mattress</ORGANIZATION>. 
"These two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of <ORGANIZATION>CS First Boston</ORGANIZATION>'s equity," <ORGANIZATION>Moody's</ORGANIZATION> said. "Total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm's equity." 
A group of <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> investors has offered to buy <ORGANIZATION>Knight-Ridder Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's ailing <ORGANIZATION>Detroit Free Press</ORGANIZATION> for $68 million but has left unclear how the offer will be financed. 
The offer came just prior to arguments before the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> over whether the <ORGANIZATION>Free Press</ORGANIZATION> should be allowed to enter into a joint operating pact with <ORGANIZATION>Gannett Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Detroit News</ORGANIZATION>. 
The group led by <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, publicist <PERSON>William D. McMaster</PERSON> didn't name an investment banker backing the deal or say how much its members will contribute to the offer.
The company has said the paper isn't for sale, and has rebuffed <PERSON>Mr. McMaster</PERSON>'s earlier requests for access to <ORGANIZATION>Free Press</ORGANIZATION> financial statements. 
In his letter to <ORGANIZATION>Knight-Ridder</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>James K. Batten</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. McMaster</PERSON> said he arrived at the $68 million figure using <ORGANIZATION>Knight-Ridder</ORGANIZATION>'s corporate financial statements and comments by <ORGANIZATION>Knight-Ridder</ORGANIZATION> officials that the <ORGANIZATION>Free Press</ORGANIZATION> has a $50 million value in salvage. 
The lawsuit was filed by <ORGANIZATION>Lone Star Steel</ORGANIZATION>'s unsecured creditors' committee on behalf of <ORGANIZATION>Lone Star Steel</ORGANIZATION>, which has been operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code since June 30. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Lone Star Steel</ORGANIZATION> lawsuit also asks the court to rule that <ORGANIZATION>Lone Star Technologies</ORGANIZATION> is jointly responsible for a $4.5 million <ORGANIZATION>Lone Star Steel</ORGANIZATION> pension payment that was due, but wasn't paid, in September and that the parent company can't recover the amount from its subsidiary if the parent company makes the payment. 
Separately, <ORGANIZATION>Lone Star Technologies</ORGANIZATION> said the bankruptcy court granted <ORGANIZATION>Lone Star Steel</ORGANIZATION> an extension until year end on its exclusive period to present a reorganization plan.
In a meeting in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> yesterday, the committee put on hold instructions it gave two weeks ago to its experts to explore other options for <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s future, the sources said.
That means <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, can go forward with its pitch for creditor approval as early as today, when it is expected to deliver a revised reorganization plan to the committee.
An <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said "the $40 million will have no effect whatsoever on the asset structure of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s plan.
Earlier this month the accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION>Ernst & Young</ORGANIZATION> and the securities firm of <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the experts hired by the creditors, contended that <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> would have difficulty meeting earnings targets the airline was projecting.
<ORGANIZATION>Ernst & Young</ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s plan would miss projections by $100 million.
<ORGANIZATION>Goldman</ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> would miss the same mark by at least $120 million. 
Yesterday, <PERSON>Joel Zweibel</PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s creditors committee, declined to comment on whether the experts had ever been instructed to look at other choices and whether they now were asked not to.
<ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> eventually decided not to sell off a major chunk, its <LOCATION>South American</LOCATION> routes, which were valued at $400 million.
Private housing starts in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> were unchanged in September from a year earlier at 144,610 units, the <ORGANIZATION>Construction Ministry</ORGANIZATION> said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Bancroft Convertible Fund Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, likely will reject a renewed offer from <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Robert I. Green</PERSON> to buy <ORGANIZATION>Bancroft</ORGANIZATION> for $18.95 a share. 
<PERSON>Sigmund Levine</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Bancroft</ORGANIZATION> secretary and treasurer, said the closed-end fund's directors will consider <PERSON>Mr. Green</PERSON>'s offer in a couple of weeks at a regular meeting. "He hasn't added anything," <PERSON>Mr. Levine</PERSON> said, predicting the board will again reject <PERSON>Mr. Green</PERSON>'s proposal. 
In a <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> filing, <PERSON>Mr. Green</PERSON> said he had boosted his holdings in <LOCATION>Bancroft</LOCATION> common to 10.4% from 8.5%, and renewed an offer he made in March to acquire the fund. 
<PERSON>Mr. Levine</PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION>Bancroft</ORGANIZATION>'s shares have been trading at or above <PERSON>Mr. Green</PERSON>'s offering price for the last several months. 
He said <PERSON>Bancroft</PERSON> attorneys are scheduled to meet with <PERSON>Mr. Green</PERSON>'s attorneys in <ORGANIZATION>Delaware Chancery Court</ORGANIZATION> at the end of this week to respond to the investor's request for company records for the past five years.
The <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Board</ORGANIZATION> said it is delaying approval of <ORGANIZATION>First Union Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's proposed $849 million acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Florida National Banks of Florida Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, pending the outcome of an examination into <ORGANIZATION>First Union</ORGANIZATION>'s lending practices in low-income neighborhoods. 
The current dispute involves allegations that <PERSON>Charlotte</PERSON>, N.C.-based <ORGANIZATION>First Union</ORGANIZATION> hasn't lived up to its responsibilities under the reinvestment act. 
During the summer, <ORGANIZATION>Legal Services Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> legal aid group, filed a petition with the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> on behalf of residents in four <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> counties.
In deferring action on the merger, the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> said, "The Board does not believe that there is sufficient information in the record at this time to allow {it} to reach a final conclusion on <ORGANIZATION>First Union</ORGANIZATION>'s record of helping to meet the credit needs of the communities it serves in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, including low to moderate-income neighborhoods in those communities." 
The <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> said the Comptroller of the Currency is expected to begin a Community Reinvestment Act examination of <ORGANIZATION>First Union's Florida and North Carolina</ORGANIZATION> banking units in the next two weeks. 
<ORGANIZATION>Florida National</ORGANIZATION>, if acquired, would almost double <ORGANIZATION>First Union</ORGANIZATION>'s banking franchise in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> to $17 billion in assets.
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>First Union</ORGANIZATION> shares rose 25 cents to $23.
Earlier this year, the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> denied an application by <ORGANIZATION>Continental Bank Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to purchase <ORGANIZATION>Grand Canyon State Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Scottsdale</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, on grounds that <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> hadn't fully complied with the Community Reinvestment Act. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> found that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> exports in 1988, net of imports, were understated by $20.9 billion a year and understated at the annualized rate of $25.4 billion in the first quarter of 1989.
The first three major areas of the service sector to be revamped were expenditures by foreign students in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> (net after expenditures by Americans studying abroad), some exports by professional firms (a law firm billing a German client for services rendered in watching legislation in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> is as much an export as shipment of an American jet engine), and improved data from travel and tourism. 
In just these three areas, the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> found $23 billion more exports than previously reported and $11.6 billion more imports, with the net result that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> service surplus in 1988 increased by $11.3 billion, to $19 billion. 
<PERSON>Mr. Freeman</PERSON> is an executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>NRM Energy Co.</ORGANIZATION> said it filed materials with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> calling for it to restructure into a corporation from a limited partnership. 
However, unpaid distributions on the acquisition preferred are cumulative and would total $23 million a year, hurting <ORGANIZATION>NRM</ORGANIZATION>'s financial flexibility and its ability to raise capital, <ORGANIZATION>NRM</ORGANIZATION> said. 
Under the plan, <ORGANIZATION>NRM</ORGANIZATION> said holders of its common units will receive one share of new common stock in <ORGANIZATION>Edisto Resources Corp.</ORGANIZATION> for every 14.97 common units owned.
After the transaction, current common unitholders will own about 21.3% of <LOCATION>Edisto</LOCATION>, current acquisition preferred holders will own 72.3%, and current stockholders of <ORGANIZATION>Edisto</ORGANIZATION> will own about 6.4%, about the same stake as <ORGANIZATION>Edisto</ORGANIZATION> owns now in <ORGANIZATION>NRM</ORGANIZATION>. Edisto currently is the general partner of <ORGANIZATION>NRM</ORGANIZATION>. 
As the largest holder of acquisition preferred units, <ORGANIZATION>Mesa Limited Partnership</ORGANIZATION> would own about 28% of <LOCATION>Edisto</LOCATION> after the transaction.
As part of the transaction, <PERSON>Edisto</PERSON> agreed to give <ORGANIZATION>Mesa</ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION>Amarillo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, oil and gas partnership managed by <PERSON>T. Boone Pickens Jr.</PERSON>, a seat on its board. 
<ORGANIZATION>NRM</ORGANIZATION> said its $2.60 senior cumulative convertible preferred units will be converted into an equal number of shares of $2.60 senior cumulative convertible preferred stock of <LOCATION>Edisto</LOCATION>. 
If Japanese companies are so efficient, why does <ORGANIZATION>Kawasaki-Rikuso Transportation Co.</ORGANIZATION> sometimes need a week just to tell its clients how soon it can ship goods from here to <LOCATION>Osaka</LOCATION>?
Because the companies have lacked office computers considered standard equipment in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION>, Japanese corporations' reputation as hi-tech powerhouses is only half right.
In April, the <ORGANIZATION>Long-Term Credit Bank</ORGANIZATION> linked its computers in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> with its three <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> offices. 
Combined PC and work-station use in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> will jump as much as 25% annually over the next five years, according to some analysts, compared with about 10% in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
And with a labor shortage and intense competitive pressure to improve efficiency, more and more Japanese companies are concluding that they have no choice. "We have too many people in our home offices," says <PERSON>Yoshio Hatakeyama</PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION>Japan Management Association</ORGANIZATION>. "Productivity in Japanese offices is relatively low." 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> may be a tough market for outsiders to penetrate, and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is hopelessly behind <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> in certain technologies.
After years of talking about selling in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, more and more <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies are seriously pouring in.
<ORGANIZATION>Lotus Development Corp.</ORGANIZATION> has slashed the lag between <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> product introductions to six months from three years.
<ORGANIZATION>Ungermann-Bass Inc.</ORGANIZATION> has a bigger share of the computer-network market in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> than at home. 
Typical is one office of the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of International Trade and Industry's Machinery and Information Industries Bureau</ORGANIZATION> -- the main bureaucracy overseeing the computer industry. "Personal Computer" yearbooks are lined up on nearly every desk, and dog-eared copies of <ORGANIZATION>Nikkei Computer</ORGANIZATION> crowd magazine racks.
In the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, more than half the PC software sold is either for spreadsheets or for database analysis, according to <LOCATION>Lotus</LOCATION>.
Machines dedicated solely to word processing, which have all but disappeared in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, are still more common in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> than PCs.
"Computers here are used for data gathering," says <PERSON>Roger J. Boisvert</PERSON>, who manages the integrated-technologies group in <ORGANIZATION>McKinsey & Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> office.
Because the Japanese "alphabet" is so huge, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> has no history of typewriter use, and so "keyboard allergy," especially among older workers, remains a common affliction. "I have no experience before with such sophisticated machinery," says <PERSON>Matsuo Toshimitsu</PERSON>, a 66-year-old executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Japan Air Lines</ORGANIZATION>, explaining his reluctance before accepting a terminal in his office this summer. 
Some analysts estimate the average PC costs about 50% more in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> than the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market, too, is dominated by a giant, <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
If a record industry lacked a common standard, <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> CD owners could listen to a <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> version of <PERSON>Madonna</PERSON>'s "Like a Prayer" but not one made for a <ORGANIZATION>Panasonic</ORGANIZATION> player.
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> established its standard to try to stop falling behind upstart <ORGANIZATION>Apple Computer</ORGANIZATION>, but <ORGANIZATION>NEC</ORGANIZATION> was ahead from the start and didn't need to invite in competitive allies. 
Most rivals "have a working relationship with <ORGANIZATION>NEC</ORGANIZATION>, often through cross-licensing of technology," the <ORGANIZATION>Japan Personal Computer Software Association</ORGANIZATION> noted recently. "They hesitate to market NEC-compatible machines; <ORGANIZATION>NEC</ORGANIZATION> disapproves of such machines, and marketing one would jeopardize their relationship." 
While tens of thousands of software packages using the <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> standard are available in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, they say only about 8,000 are written for <ORGANIZATION>NEC</ORGANIZATION>.
A year ago, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Fair Trade Commission</ORGANIZATION> warned <ORGANIZATION>NEC</ORGANIZATION> about possible violations of anti-monopoly laws for discouraging retailers from discounting. 
In <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, "software is four to five years behind the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> because hardware is four to five years behind, because <ORGANIZATION>NEC</ORGANIZATION> is enjoying a monopoly," complains <PERSON>Kazuhiko Nishi</PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION>Ascii Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s leading PC-magazine publishing and software companies. "There are no price wars, no competition." An <ORGANIZATION>NEC</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman responds that prices are higher in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> because customers put a greater emphasis on quality and service than they do in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
She adds that some technological advances trail those in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> because the Japanese still import basic operating systems from <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> companies. 
<ORGANIZATION>Toyota Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's sales offices in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> have one-tenth the computers per employee that its own <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> offices do; over the next five years, it is aiming for rough parity.
By increasing the number of PCs it uses from 66 to 1,000, <ORGANIZATION>Omron Tateishi Electronics Co.</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>Kyoto</LOCATION>, hopes not only to make certain tasks easier but also to transform the way the company is run. "Managers have long been those who supervise their subordinates so orders would be properly acted on," a spokesman says. "But new managers will have to be creators and innovators . . . and for that purpose it is necessary to create an environment where information from both inside and outside the company can be reached easily, and also shared." 
<ORGANIZATION>Seiko Epson Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a newcomer to the industry, fought off a legal challenge and started selling <ORGANIZATION>NEC</ORGANIZATION> clones last year.
<ORGANIZATION>Fujitsu Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> is lavishing the most expensive promotion campaign in its history -- including a 100,000-guest bash at <LOCATION>Tokyo Dome</LOCATION> -- for its sophisticated sound/graphics FM Towns machine, which it advertises for everything from balancing the family checkbook to practicing karaoke, bar singing. 
Two years ago, most of the smaller makers joined under the <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft Corp.</ORGANIZATION> umbrella to adopt a version of the <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> AT standard.
That hasn't generated much sales, but this summer <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> rallied all the major <ORGANIZATION>NEC</ORGANIZATION> competitors to make their new machines compatible with the <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> OS/2 standard. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> makers have under 10% share, compared with half the market in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and 80% at home. 
Though no formal trade barriers exist, the Japanese computer industry is difficult for outsiders to enter. "If it were an open market, we would have been in in 1983 or 1984," says <PERSON>Eckhard Pfeiffer</PERSON>, who heads <ORGANIZATION>Compaq Computer Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> and international operations.
His company, without any major effort, sells more machines in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> than in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
Although it has opened a <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> subsidiary, it is still only "studying" <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, the only nation that hasn't adopted IBM-oriented specifications.
And because general retail centers such as <ORGANIZATION>ComputerLand</ORGANIZATION> have little presence in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, sales remain in the iron grip of established computer makers. 
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>, though long a leader in the Japanese mainframe business, didn't introduce its first PC in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> until five years after <ORGANIZATION>NEC</ORGANIZATION> did, and that wasn't compatible even with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> standard.
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>FTC</ORGANIZATION> says it is investigating Apple for allegedly discouraging retailers from discounting. 
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> just last year started selling its first machine that could run in both Japanese and English and that substantially enhances compatibility with its <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> products. 
"It may take five years to break even in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>," says <PERSON>John A. Siniscal</PERSON>, who runs the <LOCATION>Asia-Pacific</LOCATION> office for <ORGANIZATION>McCormack & Dodge</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> software company. "But it's an enormous business opportunity." 
The downturn in total value may be only temporary, suggested <PERSON>Herb Adler</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>KPMG Peat Marwick</ORGANIZATION> partner.
Two of the major factors buoying prices, the prolonged strikes at the <LOCATION>Highland Valley</LOCATION> mine in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Cananea</LOCATION> mine in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, were finally resolved.
Also, the premiums paid by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government on a purchase of copper for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Mint were lower than expected, and acted as a price depressant, analysts said.
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> normally depends heavily on the <LOCATION>Highland Valley</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Cananea</LOCATION> mines as well as the <LOCATION>Bougainville</LOCATION> mine in <LOCATION>Papua New Guinea</LOCATION>.
But as <ORGANIZATION>Highland Valley</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Cananea</LOCATION> begin operating, they are expected to resume their roles as <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s suppliers.
According to <PERSON>Fred Demler</PERSON>, metals economist for <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, "<LOCATION>Highland Valley</LOCATION> has already started operating and <LOCATION>Cananea</LOCATION> is expected to do so soon." 
Workers at two Chilean mines, <LOCATION>Los Bronces</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>El Soldado</LOCATION>, which belong to the Exxon-owned <ORGANIZATION>Minera Disputado</ORGANIZATION> group, will vote Thursday on whether to strike after a two-year labor pact ends today.
According to <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Demler</PERSON>, the potential strike is expected to be resolved quickly, which may be one reason why the situation didn't affect prices much.
<PERSON>Mr. Demler</PERSON> said that stocks of copper in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> producers' hands at the end of September were down 16,000 metric tons from August to 30,000 tons.
Consumer stocks of copper in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> fell to 44,000 tons at the end of September from 54,000 tons a month earlier, and stocks of copper held by consumers and merchants outside of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> at the end of July stood at 123,000 tons, down from 125,000 tons in June.
According to one analyst, prices opened higher because of reports over the weekend that <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>, at the <LOCATION>Pan-American</LOCATION> summit meeting in <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>, had agreed to a reduction in their coffee export quotas for the sake of creating a new agreement.
The reports, attributed to the Colombian minister of economic development, said <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> would give up 500,000 bags of its quota and <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> 200,000 bags, the analyst said.
The Colombian minister was said to have referred to a letter that he said President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> sent to <LOCATION>Colombian</LOCATION> President <PERSON>Virgilio Barco</PERSON>, and in which President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said it was possible to overcome obstacles to a new agreement.
<ORGANIZATION>Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> filed an application with Canadian regulators to build a 4.4 billion Canadian dollar (US$3.74 billion) pipeline to transport natural gas from <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s Arctic to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> markets beginning in 
The application by Foothills, owned by Calgary-based <ORGANIZATION>Nova Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Westcoast Energy Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, is expected to kick off what could be a contentious battle for the right to transport vast quantities of gas to southern markets from still-undeveloped fields in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Mackenzie River</LOCATION> delta. 
"This is a pre-emptive strike by Foothills," said <PERSON>Rick Hillary</PERSON>, natural gas manager of the Calgary-based <ORGANIZATION>Independent Petroleum Association of Canada</ORGANIZATION>, an industry group. 
At least two rival applications are expected to emerge in coming months, including one from <ORGANIZATION>TransCanada PipeLines Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s largest natural gas pipeline operator.
Another is expected from a consortium of oil and gas producers who won conditional approval this month from <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Energy Board</ORGANIZATION> to export about 9.2 trillion cubic feet of <LOCATION>Mackenzie</LOCATION> delta gas to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> starting in 1996. 
The producers include <ORGANIZATION>Shell Canada Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Royal Dutch/Shell Group</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Esso Resources Canada Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Oil Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, which is 71%-owned by <ORGANIZATION>Exxon Corp.</ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Canada Resources Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Olympia & York Developments Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 
"The {<ORGANIZATION>National Energy Board</ORGANIZATION>} approval of the exports just waved the starting flag for the next stage, the rush to build facilities to transport the gas," said <PERSON>Bill Koerner</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Brady & Berliner</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, law firm. 
Foothills' main rival to build a <ORGANIZATION>Mackenzie Delta</ORGANIZATION> pipeline is likely to be <ORGANIZATION>TransCanada PipeLines</ORGANIZATION>.
The Toronto-based company, together with <ORGANIZATION>Tenneco Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, has had an incomplete proposal filed with Canadian regulators since 1984 that it is now updating. 
Like Foothills, <ORGANIZATION>TransCanada</ORGANIZATION>'s Polar Gas consortium plans to build a pipeline directly south from the <LOCATION>Mackenzie River</LOCATION> delta in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s western Arctic with an initial capacity to transport 1.2 billion cubic feet of gas daily.
Industry sources said they expect a fierce battle to emerge between <ORGANIZATION>TransCanada</ORGANIZATION>, which has a monopoly on Canadian gas transportation east of <LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Nova</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Westcoast</LOCATION>, which control the pipelines within and running west of <LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION>, respectively. 
But last week <PERSON>Gerald Maier</PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>TransCanada</ORGANIZATION>, said the company "intends to be a party to any transportation system that goes up there" and that it would consider joint ventures with other players to ensure it has a role. 
<PERSON>Kent Jesperson</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Foothills</ORGANIZATION>, said the company believes the project would be viable if gas prices reach US$3.25 a thousand cubic feet by 1995, in current dollars, up from a current spot price of about US$1.50. 
<PERSON>Mr. Jesperson</PERSON>'s US$3.25 estimate is somewhat below the $3.39 floor price that Calgary-based consulting firm <ORGANIZATION>Paul Ziff & Co.</ORGANIZATION> recently said would be needed for <PERSON>Mackenzie</PERSON> delta gas producers to see a return on their investment. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> gas buyers must also decide whether they want to enter firm contracts for <ORGANIZATION>Mackenzie</ORGANIZATION> delta gas or develop <LOCATION>Alaskan</LOCATION> reserves in the <LOCATION>Prudhoe Bay</LOCATION> area first, a project that has been on hold for more than a decade. 
<PERSON>Robert Pierce</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Foothills</ORGANIZATION>, said it's too early to say whether <LOCATION>Alaskan</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Mackenzie</LOCATION> delta gas would flow to market first.
But <PERSON>Foothills</PERSON> said it plans to seek regulatory approval to build an alternative line, the <ORGANIZATION>Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System</ORGANIZATION> further north toward <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>.
If that option is favored by gas buyers and regulators, <PERSON>Foothills</PERSON> said it would build another smaller pipeline connecting <ORGANIZATION>Mackenzie Delta</ORGANIZATION> reserves to the <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> mainline. 
<PERSON>Douglas Stoneman</PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Shell Canada</ORGANIZATION>, noted that producers would prefer to avoid hearings into competing proposals that would lengthen the regulatory review process and bog down development. 
Instead, <PERSON>Richard Haskayne</PERSON>, president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Interprovincial</ORGANIZATION>'s Calgary-based parent, <ORGANIZATION>Interhome Energy Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said the company would prefer to work with other "interested parties" on a joint proposal. 
A half-dozen candidates, backing policies ranging from Thatcherism to watered-down Marxism, are given a chance of winning. "Whoever says he knows which of the six will win is out of his mind," says <PERSON>Antonio Britto</PERSON>, a centrist member of <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>. 
The favorite remains <PERSON>Fernando Collor de Mello</PERSON>, a 40-year-old former governor of the state of <LOCATION>Alagoas</LOCATION>.
He came out of nowhere to grab the lead in opinion polls, probably less because of his vague program to "build a new <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>" than because of his good looks, the open backing of the powerful <PERSON>Rede Globo</PERSON> television network and his reputation as a hunter of "maharajahs," or overpaid and underworked civil servants. 
Two left-wing politicians, Socialist <PERSON>Leonel Brizola</PERSON>, a former governor of <LOCATION>Rio de Janeiro</LOCATION> state, and Marxist-leaning <PERSON>Luis Inacio da Silva</PERSON>, currently are running neck and neck at about 15%, and three other candidates are given a chance of reaching the Dec. 17 runoff election between the two biggest vote-getters: Social Democrat <PERSON>Mario Covas</PERSON> and two conservatives, <PERSON>Paulo Salim Maluf</PERSON>, a former governor of the state of <LOCATION>Sao Paulo</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Guilherme Afif Domingos</PERSON>. 
The big question is whether the new president will have the strength and the political support in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to take steps to cure <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s economic ills.
If <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> devises an economic strategy allowing it to resume growth and service debt, this could lead it to open up and deregulate its sheltered economy, analysts say, just as Argentinian President <PERSON>Carlos Saul Menem</PERSON> has been doing even though he was elected on a populist platform. 
"Confidence was starting to come back because we didn't have wildly volatile days," says <PERSON>Tyler Jenks</PERSON>, research director for <ORGANIZATION>Kanon Bloch Carre & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> research firm. "Now everything" -- such as program trading and wide stock market swings -- "that everyone had pushed back in their consciousness is just sitting right there." 
At <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Investments</ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest fund group, money funds continue to draw the most business, says <PERSON>Michael Hines</PERSON>, vice president, marketing.
In October, net sales of stock funds at <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity</ORGANIZATION> dropped sharply, <PERSON>Mr. Hines</PERSON> said.
"There will be a continuation and possibly greater focus on conservative equity funds, at the expense of growth and aggressive growth funds," says <PERSON>Avi Nachmany</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Strategic Insight</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> fund-research concern. 
"It's a super-exciting set of discoveries," says <PERSON>Bert Vogelstein</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Johns Hopkins University</ORGANIZATION> researcher who has just found a gene pivotal to the triggering of colon cancer. "Only a decade ago cancer was a black box about which we knew nothing at the molecular level.
<PERSON>Bill</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bonnie Quinlan</PERSON> are among the first beneficiaries of the new findings.
The <LOCATION>Dedham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, couple knew even before <PERSON>Bonnie</PERSON> became pregnant in 1987 that any child of theirs had a 50% chance of being at risk for retinoblastoma, an eye cancer that occurs about once every 20,000 births.
A test using new "genetic probes" showed that little <PERSON>Will Quinlan</PERSON> had not inherited a damaged retinoblastoma supressor gene and, therefore, faced no more risk than other children of developing the rare cancer. "It made our New Year," says <PERSON>Mr. Quinlan</PERSON>. 
Equally important, the initial discovery of the gene that controls retinal cell growth, made by a <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> doctor named <PERSON>Thaddeus Dryja</PERSON>, has opened a field of cancer study, which in recent months has exploded. "It turns out that studying a tragic but uncommon tumor made possible some fundamental insights about the most basic workings of cancer," says <PERSON>Samuel Broder</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION>. "All this may not be obvious to the public, which is concerned about advances in treatment, but I am convinced this basic research will begin showing results there soon." 
Right now about a dozen laboratories, in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, are racing to unmask other suspected tumor-suppressing genes.
Then, a scientific team led by molecular geneticist <PERSON>Webster Cavenee</PERSON>, then at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Utah</ORGANIZATION>, found the answer.
It was the first time anyone had showed that the loss of both copies of the same gene could lead to the eruption of a cancer. "It was extraordinarily satisfying," says <PERSON>Dr. Knudson</PERSON>, now at Fox Chase Cancer Research Center in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>. "I was convinced that what was true of retinoblastoma would be true for all cancers." 
But in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Dr. Vogelstein</PERSON>, a young molecular biologist at <ORGANIZATION>Johns Hopkins Medical School</ORGANIZATION>, believed <PERSON>Dr. Knudson</PERSON> was right, and set out to repeat the <LOCATION>Cavenee</LOCATION> experiment in cells from other cancers.
<PERSON>Dr. Vogelstein</PERSON> next turned his attention to colon cancer, the second biggest cancer killer in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> after lung cancer.
<PERSON>Dr. Vogelstein</PERSON> and a doctoral student, <PERSON>Eric Fearon</PERSON>, began months of tedious and often frustrating probing of the chromosomes searching for signs of genetic damage.
Their report galvanized other molecular biologists. "It was the confirming evidence we all needed that {gene} losses were critical to the development of a common tumor," says Ray White at <ORGANIZATION>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Salt Lake City</LOCATION>. 
His doubts stemmed from the fact that several years earlier a <ORGANIZATION>Princeton University</ORGANIZATION> researcher, <PERSON>Arnold Levine</PERSON>, had found in experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could transform normal cells into cancerous ones.
But <PERSON>Mr. Levine</PERSON> had said the p53 gene caused cancer by promoting growth, whereas the <PERSON>Johns Hopkins</PERSON> scientists were looking for a gene that suppressed growth. 
Despite that, when the <PERSON>Johns Hopkins</PERSON> scientists compared the gene they had found in the human cancer cells with the <PERSON>Mr. Levine</PERSON>'s p53 gene they found the two were identical; it turned out that in <PERSON>Mr. Levine</PERSON>'s cancer studies, he had unknowingly been observing a damaged form of p53 -- a cancer-suppressing gene. 
The discovery "suddenly puts an obscure gene right in the cockpit of cancer formation," says <PERSON>Robert Weinberg</PERSON>, a leader in cancer-gene research at <ORGANIZATION>Whitehead Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>. 
Researchers in <LOCATION>Edinburgh</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>, have found that in 23 of 38 breast tumors, one copy of chromosome 17 was mutated at the spot where gene p53 lies.
In a report out last week, <PERSON>John Minna</PERSON> and colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION> say that about half the cells taken from lung cancer tissue they tested are missing this gene. 
Ray White in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Walter Bodmer</PERSON>, a researcher in <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>, are close to finding another gene involved with some types of colon cancer, thought to be on chromosome 5. 
Already two major pharmaceutical companies, the <ORGANIZATION>Squibb</ORGANIZATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, are collaborating with gene hunters to turn the anticipated cascade of discoveries into predictive tests and, maybe, new therapies. 
In any case, says <PERSON>Dr. Minna</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION>, "We're witnessing the discovery of one of the most important steps in the genesis of cancer." 
It can be hoped that <LOCATION>Spanish</LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON>Felipe Gonzalez</PERSON> will draw the right conclusion from his narrow election victory Sunday.
<PERSON>Mr. Gonzalez</PERSON> and his colleagues, particularly the finance minister, <PERSON>Carlos Solchaga</PERSON>, are charged with having abandoned their socialist principles and with having become arrogant elitists who refuse even to go on television (controlled by the state) to face their accusers.
They are very considerable: Since 1986, when <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> joined the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>, its gross domestic product has grown at an annual average of 4.6% -- the fastest in the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Gonzalez</PERSON> also has split with the left in reaffirming <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> commitment and in renewing a defense treaty with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
They, as well as numerous Latin American and East European countries that hope to adopt elements of the <LOCATION>Spanish</LOCATION> model, are supporting the direction <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> is taking.

Tales of haunts and horrors are proliferating beyond the nation's Elm Streets and <LOCATION>Amityvilles</LOCATION>. "I get calls nearly every day from people who have ghosts in their house," says <PERSON>Raymond Hyman</PERSON>, a skeptical psychology professor at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Oregon</ORGANIZATION>. 
In a public opinion poll published in the October issue of Parents Magazine, a third of those queried said they believe that ghosts or spirits make themselves known to people.

As expected, the longer-term tax-exempt <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> bonds had yields nearly as high as those on taxable long-term <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bonds.
Bond dealers said the rates for the long-term tax-exempt <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> bonds were among the highest, as a percentage of <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> rates, for any <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> issue in recent memory. 
A spokesman for <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> Comptroller <PERSON>Harrison Goldin</PERSON> said the high rates reflect investors concerns about the city's financial health and political uncertainties.

Singer <PERSON>Bette Midler</PERSON> won a $400,000 federal court jury verdict against <ORGANIZATION>Young & Rubicam</ORGANIZATION> in a case that threatens a popular advertising industry practice of using "sound-alike" performers to tout products. 
The decision in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> federal court stems from a 1985 <ORGANIZATION>Mercury Sable TV</ORGANIZATION> ad that <ORGANIZATION>Young & Rubicam</ORGANIZATION> worked up for <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co</ORGANIZATION>.
The agency then turned to a former backup singer for <PERSON>Ms. Midler</PERSON> who appeared in the ad and crooned what was generally considered a more than credible imitation of <PERSON>Ms. Midler</PERSON>'s 1973 hit song "Do You <PERSON>Wanna Dance</PERSON>." 
<PERSON>Peter Laird</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> lawyer for <PERSON>Ms. Midler</PERSON>, said, "We believe that the verdict reaffirms her position and our position that advertisers and advertising agencies cannot with impunity imitate the voices of well-known performers.
Last year's appeals court decision, for instance, spawned several suits, reportedly including a recent action by the heirs of singer <PERSON>Bobby Darin</PERSON> against <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's Corp.</ORGANIZATION> over its "Mac Tonight" TV commercials, a rough parody of <PERSON>Mr. Darin</PERSON>'s "Mack the Knife" trademark. 
The appeals-court decision last year was particularly surprising because the same court had dismissed a similar case in 1970 involving singer <PERSON>Nancy Sinatra</PERSON> and a tire ad -- also a <ORGANIZATION>Young & Rubicam</ORGANIZATION> product.
<PERSON>Ms. Sinatra</PERSON> sued over the use of her "These Boots are Made for <PERSON>Walkin</PERSON>'" song in the ad. 
"One thing that is a little unnerving is that you had three old men on the court of appeals in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> coming up with a statement that <PERSON>Nancy Sinatra</PERSON> is not distinctive but that <PERSON>Bette Midler</PERSON> is.
I am not sure that judges, many of whom I like very much, are proper repositories for making distinctions about pop singers," said <PERSON>Richard Kurnit</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> advertising lawyer. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>Rymer</ORGANIZATION> closed yesterday at $10.875, down 12.5 cents. 
<ORGANIZATION>Kidder, Peabody & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION>, announced it would stop doing stock-index arbitrage for its own account, and <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION> pulled out of the practice altogether. 
At the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, which has been buffeted by complaints from angry individual investors and the exchange's own listed companies, Chairman <PERSON>John J. Phelan Jr.</PERSON> held an emergency meeting with senior partners of some of the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s 49 stock specialist firms.
A <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> spokesman would only say, "We're working the problem and looking at the issue and meeting with a broad number of customers and constituents to get their views and ideas on the issue." The program-trading outcry was taken to a new level when giant <ORGANIZATION>Contel Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it and 20 or more of the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s listed companies are forming an unprecedented alliance to complain about the exchange's role in program trading. 
<ORGANIZATION>Merrill</ORGANIZATION> has been the fourth-biggest stock-index arbitrage trader on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> this year, executing an average of 18.1 million shares a month in such trades, or about one million shares a day. 
<ORGANIZATION>Merrill</ORGANIZATION>, in a statement by Chairman <PERSON>William A. Schreyer</PERSON> and President <PERSON>Daniel P. Tully</PERSON>, said index arbitrage "has been clearly identified in the investing public's mind as a contributing factor to excess market volatility," so <ORGANIZATION>Merrill</ORGANIZATION> won't execute such trades until "effective controls" are in place. 
Last Thursday, <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> also said it would cease index arbitrage altogether, but the firm wasn't as big an index arbitrager as <ORGANIZATION>Merrill</ORGANIZATION> is.
Other large firms, including <ORGANIZATION>Bear, Stearns & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, last week announced a pullback from index arbitrage, but only for the firms' own accounts. 
<ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION> made an abrupt about-face on program trading yesterday, after a special meeting between the firm's president and chief executive officer, <ORGANIZATION>Michael Carpenter</ORGANIZATION>, and its senior managers.
Just a week ago, <PERSON>Mr. Carpenter</PERSON> staunchly defended index arbitrage at <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION>, the most active index-arbitrage trading firm on the stock exchange this year.
Index arbitrage, <PERSON>Mr. Carpenter</PERSON> said last week, doesn't have a "negative impact on the market as a whole" and <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION>'s customers were "sophisticated" enough to know that. 
<ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION> so far this year has executed a monthly average of 37.8 million shares in index-arbitrage trading, and is second only to <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley</ORGANIZATION> in overall program trading, which includes index arbitrage.
Most of <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION>'s program trading is for its own account, according to the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Kidder</PERSON> denied that <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, <PERSON>John F. Welch</PERSON>, had anything to do with <PERSON>Kidder</PERSON>'s decision.
But at least one chief executive said he called <PERSON>Mr. Welch</PERSON> to complain about <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION>'s aggressive use of program trading, and other market sources said they understood that <PERSON>Mr. Welch</PERSON> received many phone calls complaining about <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION>'s reliance on index arbitrage as a major business.
<ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION> has generally been sensitive to suggestions that GE makes decisions for its <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION> unit. "Our decision had nothing to do with any pressure <PERSON>Mr. Welch</PERSON> received," <PERSON>Mr. Carpenter</PERSON> said. "This was a <ORGANIZATION>Kidder Peabody</ORGANIZATION> stand-alone decision." 
A spokeswoman for GE in <LOCATION>Fairfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, said, "Absolutely no one spoke to <PERSON>Jack Welch</PERSON> on this subject" and added, "Anyone who claims they talked to <PERSON>Jack Welch</PERSON> isn't telling the truth." 
<ORGANIZATION>Merrill</ORGANIZATION>'s index arbitragers will continue to do other kinds of computer-assisted program trading, so there probably won't be any layoffs at the firm, people familiar with <ORGANIZATION>Merrill</ORGANIZATION>'s program operation said. 
Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Bear Stearns Chairman</ORGANIZATION> and Chief Executive <PERSON>Alan C. Greenberg</PERSON> said his firm will continue stock-index arbitrage for its clients.
<PERSON>Mr. Greenberg</PERSON>, noting that stock-index arbitrage rises and ebbs with stock market's volatility, said that for the first four months of the firm's fiscal year beginning in July, stock-index arbitrage had been a "break-even" proposition for <PERSON>Bear Stearns</PERSON>. 
In response to a shareholder's suggestion, <PERSON>Mr. Greenberg</PERSON> agreed that <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> firms will simply pick up the index-arbitrage business left behind by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> institutions. 
And there was speculation yesterday that <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Investments</ORGANIZATION> and other large mutual-fund companies might soon follow the lead of <ORGANIZATION>Kemper Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and other institutions in cutting off trading business to securities firms that do program trading.
A <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity</ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> denied the speculation, saying the program-trading issue was more of a regulatory problem. 
But a much smaller mutual fund company, the <ORGANIZATION>USAA Investment Management Co.</ORGANIZATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION>USAA</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, said it informed nine national brokerage firms it will cease business with them unless they stop index-arbitrage trading.
<PERSON>Michael J.C. Roth</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>USAA</ORGANIZATION> executive vice president, called program trading "mindless." He said there is "no valid investment reason" for stock-index futures to exist. 
<PERSON>Charles Wohlstetter</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Contel</ORGANIZATION>, who is helping organize the alliance of Big Board-listed firms, said he had no time to work yesterday because he received so many phone calls, faxes and letters supporting his view that the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> has been turned into a "gambling casino" by program traders. 
"We are reaching the moment of truth" on Wall Street, said Rep. <PERSON>Edward J. Markey</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>), chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on telecommunications and finance.

<ORGANIZATION>The Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> agreed to decide whether the federal <ORGANIZATION>Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.</ORGANIZATION> may require <ORGANIZATION>LTV Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to reassume funding responsibility for a $2.3 billion shortfall in the company's pension plans. 
The filing was partly the result of the $2.3 billion shortfall in <ORGANIZATION>LTV</ORGANIZATION>'s three pension plans operated for its <ORGANIZATION>LTV Steel Co.</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary's employees. 
In January 1987, as <ORGANIZATION>LTV Steel</ORGANIZATION> continued operating while under reorganization, the agency terminated the three <ORGANIZATION>LTV</ORGANIZATION> pension plans to keep its insurance liability from increasing.
A few months later, under pressure from the <ORGANIZATION>United Steelworkers</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>LTV</ORGANIZATION> instituted a new program to provide retirement benefits similar to those in the terminated plans.
<ORGANIZATION>LTV</ORGANIZATION> challenged the order, and a federal district court in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> in June 1988 ruled that the agency improperly ordered <ORGANIZATION>LTV</ORGANIZATION> to reassume responsibility for the plans. 
In <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>LTV</ORGANIZATION> said that it was disappointed that the court agreed to hear the case because it believes the move will further delay its Chapter 11 proceedings.
But <ORGANIZATION>LTV</ORGANIZATION>, a steel, aerospace and energy concern, said it is confident that the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> will uphold the lower-court decisions and said it expects to continue discussions with the agency about a settlement while the case is being reviewed.

Gen-Probe, an industry leader in the field of genetic probes, which is a new technology used in diagnostic tests, last year signed an agreement for <ORGANIZATION>Chugai</ORGANIZATION> to exclusively market its diagnostic products in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> for infectious diseases and cancer.
That arrangement apparently has worked well, and <PERSON>Thomas A. Bologna</PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Gen-Probe</ORGANIZATION>, founded in 1983, said the sale of the company means "we will be able to concentrate on running the business rather than always looking for sources of financing." <LOCATION>Chugai</LOCATION> agreed to pay $6.25 a share for <ORGANIZATION>Gen-Probe</ORGANIZATION>'s 17.6 million common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. 
Because the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> leads in most areas of biotechnology -- largely because of research investment by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government -- the sale is sure to increase concerns that Japanese companies will buy <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> know-how and use it to obtain the upper hand in biotechnology trade and competition. 
"The biotechnology firms may be setting up their own competitors," said <PERSON>Richard Godown</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Industrial Biotechnology Association</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Chugai</PERSON> has been one of the most active Japanese players in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> biotechnology companies; it has an equity investment in <ORGANIZATION>Genetics Institute Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, and a joint-venture agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Upjohn Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Kalamazoo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich</LOCATION>. 
The Japanese government, <PERSON>Mr. Godown</PERSON> said, has stated that it wants 10% to 11% of its gross national product to come from biotechnology products. "It is becoming more of a horse race every day between the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>," he said, adding that some fear that as with the semiconductor, electronics, and automobile industries, Japanese companies will use U.S.-developed technology to gain trade advantages. 
By 1988, when only 10 genetic probe-based tests of diagnostic infectious diseases of humans had been approved for marketing by the <ORGANIZATION>Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION>, eight of them had been developed and sold by <ORGANIZATION>Gen-Probe</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Osamu Nagayama</PERSON>, deputy president of <LOCATION>Chugai</LOCATION>, which spends about 15% of its sales on research and development, was unable to pinpoint how much money <PERSON>Chugai</PERSON> would pump into <ORGANIZATION>Gen-Probe</ORGANIZATION>. "We think Gen-Probe has technology important to people's health," he said, adding: "We think it is important for us to have such technology." He and <PERSON>Mr. Bologna</PERSON> emphasized that both companies would gain technological knowledge through the sale of <ORGANIZATION>Gen-Probe</ORGANIZATION>, which will expand "significantly" as a result of the acquisition. 
Recently, <ORGANIZATION>Gen-Probe</ORGANIZATION> received a broad <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> patent for a technology that helps detect, identify and quantify non-viral organisms through the targeting of a form of genetic material called ribosomal <ORGANIZATION>RNA</ORGANIZATION>. 
Among other things, <PERSON>Mr. Bologna</PERSON> said that the sale will facilitate <ORGANIZATION>Gen-Probe</ORGANIZATION>'s marketing of a diagnostic test for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. 
<PERSON>Chugai</PERSON> also will help Gen-Probe with its regulatory and marketing expertise in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Bologna</PERSON> said.

<PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>'s remarks were seen as a rebuff to several leading members of her own <ORGANIZATION>Conservative Party</ORGANIZATION> who have called for a more clear-cut British commitment to the <ORGANIZATION>EMS</ORGANIZATION>. 
At the same time, a recent poll shows that <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> has hit the lowest popularity rating of any <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> leader since polling began 50 years ago. 
Comments by <PERSON>John Major</PERSON>, who has succeeded <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>, also failed to damp market concern, despite his pledge to maintain relatively high British interest rates. 
One <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trader, however, dismissed sterling doomsayers while acknowledging there is little immediate upside potential for the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> unit.

<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Mr. Azoff</PERSON> declined comment, as did <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON>Mr. Azoff</PERSON> had also been discussing such a venture.
But record industry executives familiar with the talks said <PERSON>Mr. Azoff</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> came to an agreement yesterday to form a 50-50 joint-venture company funded by <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> and run by <PERSON>Mr. Azoff</PERSON>.
The agreement is said to be similar to <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>'s 50-50 partnership with record and movie producer <PERSON>David Geffen</PERSON>, whose films and records are distributed by the <ORGANIZATION>Warner Bros.</ORGANIZATION> studio and the <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> records unit.
Like <PERSON>Mr. Geffen</PERSON>'s arrangement, the venture gives <PERSON>Mr. Azoff</PERSON> a link to the world's largest and most successful record distributor; in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> alone, <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> has a 40% share of the market, about double its nearest competitor, <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>CBS Records</ORGANIZATION>.
The 41-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Azoff</PERSON>, a former rock `n' roll manager, is credited with turning around <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION>'s once-moribund music division in his six years at the company.
But <PERSON>Mr. Azoff</PERSON> had been negotiating for more than a year to get out of his <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> contract, which expired in 1991.
<PERSON>Mr. Azoff</PERSON> reportedly was bored and frequently clashed with top <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> management over a number of issues such as compensation and business plans. 
<ORGANIZATION>Warner Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION> resumed settlement talks on their legal battle over <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> producers <PERSON>Peter Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jon Peters</PERSON>, but continued to level strong accusations at each other in legal documents. 
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> has filed a $1 billion breach of contract suit in <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Superior Court</ORGANIZATION> against <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> and the Guber-Peters duo, who in turn are countersuing <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> for trying to interfere in <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Guber Peters Entertainment Co.</ORGANIZATION> in two transactions valued at over $5 billion. 
Although settlement talks had been dropped, attorneys for the two sides apparently began talking again yesterday in an attempt to settle the matter before Thursday, when a judge is expected to rule on <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>'s request for an injunction that would block the two producers from taking over the management of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>.
Yesterday, in documents filed in connection with that case, <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> accused <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> officials of falsely claiming that they never read the five-year contract requiring the two producers to make movies exclusively for <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>, citing <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> filings made by <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> that described the contracts. 
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> was referring to documents filed last week in which <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> Vice Chairman <PERSON>Michael Schulof</PERSON> and <PERSON>Walter Yetnikoff</PERSON>, president of its <ORGANIZATION>CBS Records</ORGANIZATION> unit, said they had taken <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> at their word when the producers told them that getting out of the contract would be no problem because of a previous oral agreement. 
<PERSON>Wayne Smith</PERSON>, an attorney at <ORGANIZATION>Gibson</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Dunn & Crutcher</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> representing <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> executives hadn't seen the contract because "it wasn't relevant once <PERSON>Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peters</PERSON> told them <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> would let them terminate it at any time." <PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON> said statements about the contract made in <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> filings were made by attorneys who did have access to the contracts but who weren't part of the negotiations between <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> and the duo. 
<PERSON>Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peters</PERSON> that the two sides had an oral agreement that enabled the producers to terminate their contract with <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> should the opportunity to run a major studio come up.
But <PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> intends to prove that the oral agreement did in fact exist, and that even the existing written contract doesn't preclude the producers from taking executive posts at another studio. 
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> described as "nonsense" yesterday <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>'s assertions in prior court filings that <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> could in theory run <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> while still fulfilling their contract to produce movies for <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>.
Such a dual role would be "impractical and unethical," <PERSON>Warner</PERSON> said, adding, "that concept is as silly as suggesting that the head coach of the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Dodgers</ORGANIZATION> could simultaneously be general manager of the <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco Giants</ORGANIZATION>." 
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>, which is in the process of being acquired by New York-based <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, also said it paid the two producers a fixed annual salary of $3 million. 
<ORGANIZATION>Cray Research Inc.</ORGANIZATION> won government clearance for its proposed reorganization of founder <PERSON>Seymour Cray</PERSON>'s supercomputer design team into a separate company. 
<ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION> approval of the move as a tax-free transaction was the last hurdle to splitting up the world's dominant maker of supercomputers, which <PERSON>Mr. Cray</PERSON> founded in 1974. 
<ORGANIZATION>Cray</ORGANIZATION>'s directors set Nov. 15 as the record date for distribution of shares in the new company, to be called <ORGANIZATION>Cray Computer Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
An estimated 14.7 million <ORGANIZATION>Cray Computer</ORGANIZATION> shares will be distributed, <ORGANIZATION>Cray Research</ORGANIZATION> said. 
Under the accord, <ORGANIZATION>Cray Research</ORGANIZATION> will transfer to <PERSON>Mr. Cray</PERSON>'s fledgling operation $53.3 million of assets primarily related to the Cray-3 development project his team is undertaking and will lend <ORGANIZATION>Cray Computer</ORGANIZATION> $98.6 million. 
<ORGANIZATION>Cray Research</ORGANIZATION> will retain a 10% interest in the new company, which will be based in <LOCATION>Colorado Springs</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>WPP GROUP'S Ogilvy & Mather</ORGANIZATION> expects profit margins to improve to 11.5% in 1990 in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Yesterday's edition didn't specify where the improvement would take place. 
The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</ORGANIZATION> sued <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> state for age discrimination against appointed state judges.
The suit, filed in federal court in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, charges that <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s mandatory retirement age of 76 violates federal law. 
Separately, the commission intervened in a <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> state judge's age-bias suit in federal court in <LOCATION>New Haven</LOCATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>New York</ORGANIZATION> suit was filed on behalf of Justice <PERSON>Isaac Rubin</PERSON>, whose appointment to the state appellate division expires at year end, and all other judges hurt by the alleged age discrimination.
The suit, assigned to federal <PERSON>Judge Kimba Wood</PERSON>, seeks a permanent injunction, back pay for judges who have been forced to retire, reinstatement of retired judges and "other affirmative relief necessary to eradicate the effects of (<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s) unlawful employment practices." 
The issue is one of a judge's experience, his competence and his physical ability to serve on the bench," Justice <PERSON>Rubin</PERSON> said. "I've had no problems performing my duties and responsibilities." Because Justice <PERSON>Rubin</PERSON> turned 76 on May 9, he isn't eligible to be reappointed to the bench at the end of the year. 
Most <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> judges are elected, and the federal age-discrimination law doesn't apply to elected officials, said <PERSON>James L. Lee</PERSON>, regional attorney for the <ORGANIZATION>EEOC</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
In <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, however, most state judges are appointed by the governor and approved by the <ORGANIZATION>state legislature</ORGANIZATION>.
The parties in the <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> case have agreed to stay proceedings pending the appeal of another <ORGANIZATION>EEOC</ORGANIZATION> age-bias case against <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>.
In the <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> case, a federal judge ruled that the state's mandatory age of 70 for appointed judges was illegal; <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>'s appeal of that decision is pending before the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Aaron Ment</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>'s chief court administrator, declined to comment on the suit and the <ORGANIZATION>EEOC</ORGANIZATION>'s intervention.
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON>Dick Thornburgh</PERSON>'s plan to dissolve the 14 regional organized-crime strike forces is expected to go into effect next month, despite the opposition of <ORGANIZATION>Democratic</ORGANIZATION> congressional leaders and lawyers in the special units. 
<PERSON>Mr. Thornburgh</PERSON> will be free to disband the strike forces after <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> approves a $479 million appropriation for federal law-enforcement and drug-interdiction agencies, according to <PERSON>David Runkel</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman.
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> temporarily halted <PERSON>Mr. Thornburgh</PERSON>'s effort with an appropriation resolution that prohibited him from using budgeted funds to implement his plan. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Eastern District</ORGANIZATION> unit in <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, lost seven of its 15 attorneys this year partly because the lawyers were troubled by the proposed reorganization, says <PERSON>Laura A. Brevetti</PERSON>, who left the strike force to join <ORGANIZATION>Morrison Cohen Singer & Weinstein</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> law firm. 
A spokesman for <PERSON>Sen. Edward M. Kennedy</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>) says <PERSON>Mr. Thornburgh</PERSON> would be required to reinstate the units next year if an proposed omnibus crime bill is passed.
<PERSON>Mr. Runkel</PERSON> says he doubts <PERSON>Mr. Kennedy</PERSON> can muster enough congressional support to reorganize the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>WHITMAN & RANSOM</ORGANIZATION> recruits lawyers from disbanding firm: The 204-lawyer <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> firm will bring in at least 12 partners and a not yet determined number of associates from <ORGANIZATION>Golenbock & Barell</ORGANIZATION>, which will dissolve Dec. 31.
Some <PERSON>Golenbock</PERSON> lawyers won't be invited to join <ORGANIZATION>Whitman & Ransom</ORGANIZATION>, according to partners at both firms.
<ORGANIZATION>Whitman & Ransom</ORGANIZATION> managing partner <PERSON>Maged F. Riad</PERSON> said the Golenbock recruits will enhance the firm's corporate and litigation departments. 
SHORT SKIRTS not welcome in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> court: <PERSON>Shelly Hancock</PERSON>, a male county court judge in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, refused to let a woman plead guilty to a drunk-driving charge because her skirt stopped three inches above her knees.
<PERSON>Kelly Siegler</PERSON>, an assistant district attorney who was in the courtroom, disputed suggestions the action was sexist, saying she had seen <PERSON>Judge Hancock</PERSON> turn away male defendants dressed in shorts, tank tops or muscle shirts "many times." <PERSON>Judge Hancock</PERSON> didn't return phone calls. 
<ORGANIZATION>Interface Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Ann Arbor</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, said it will report net income for the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 fell to $470,000, or 11 cents a share, from $805,000, or 19 cents a share, a year earlier. 
<ORGANIZATION>Penn Central Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION>, said it agreed in principle to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Noranda Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Carol Cable Co.</ORGANIZATION> unit for $177 million. 
The company said <ORGANIZATION>Carol Cable</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Pawtucket</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>R.I.</LOCATION>, is a leading supplier of electrical and electronic wire and cable for the distributor, retail and original equipment manufacturer markets. 
The plan is subject to a satisfactory due diligence investigation of <ORGANIZATION>Carol Cable</ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON>Penn Central</PERSON>, a definitive agreement and regulatory approvals. 
<ORGANIZATION>USG Corp.</ORGANIZATION> agreed to sell its headquarters building here to <ORGANIZATION>Manufacturers Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>, and will lease the 19-story facility until it moves to a new quarters in 1992. 
Separately, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mazda Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales arm said they are recalling about 88,500 1988-model Mercury Tracers and 220,000 1986, 1987 and 1988 model <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> 323s equipped with 1.6-liter fuel-injected engines to replace the oil filler cap.
<ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> makes the Tracer for <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>. 
A <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the <LOCATION>Dearborn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, auto maker isn't aware of any injuries caused by the windshield problem.
<ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said a combination of limited crankcase ventilation and improper maintenance could cause engine oil in some of the <ORGANIZATION>Mercury Tracers</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> 323s to deteriorate more rapidly than normal, causing increased engine noise or reduced engine life.
Separately, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said it will offer $750 cash rebates to buyers of its 1990-model <ORGANIZATION>Ford Bronco</ORGANIZATION> sport utility vehicle.
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> also offered the low financing rate option on 1989-model <ORGANIZATION>Broncos</ORGANIZATION>, which previously carried a $750 cash discount.
GREAT NORTHERN <ORGANIZATION>NEKOOSA</ORGANIZATION> is being sought by another big paper company, <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, for $58 a share, or about $3.18 billion.
<ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Kidder Peabody</ORGANIZATION> unit said it would stop doing stock-index arbitrage for its own account, while <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION> said it was halting such trading entirely.
The <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> let stand a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> ruling that all manufacturers of an anti-miscarriage drug are liable for injuries or deaths if the actual maker isn't known. 
<ORGANIZATION>Revco</ORGANIZATION> received a $925 million takeover offer from <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> financier <ORGANIZATION>Robert Bass</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Acadia Partners</ORGANIZATION>.

The <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> delayed approval of <ORGANIZATION>First Union</ORGANIZATION>'s $849 million acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Florida National Banks</ORGANIZATION> pending a review of <ORGANIZATION>First Union</ORGANIZATION>'s lending practices in low-income neighborhoods. 
<PERSON>Allianz</PERSON> of <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> entered the takeover battle between <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Maxwell</ORGANIZATION> agreed to sell its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> printing unit to Quebecor for $500 million, making Quebecor the No. 2 commercial printer in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Vitro S.A.</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Monterrey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, said its <ORGANIZATION>THR Corp.</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary has entered into definitive loan agreements in connection with <PERSON>Vitro</PERSON>'s $21.25-a-share tender offer for <ORGANIZATION>Anchor Glass Container Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
The agreements are with <ORGANIZATION>Security Pacific National Bank</ORGANIZATION> and an affiliate of <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Proceeds of the loan agreement, together with funds from <PERSON>Vitro</PERSON>, will permit the purchase of all shares outstanding of Anchor and the payment of all related costs and expenses. 
An ancient red-figured Greek kylix, or drinking cup, was recovered backstage at <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s this spring and has been returned to the <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> couple who lost it in a burglary three years ago.
<PERSON>Robert Guy</PERSON>, an associate curator at the <ORGANIZATION>Princeton Art Museum</ORGANIZATION>, was previewing a June antiquities sale at the auction house when he recognized the kylix, which he, as a specialist in Attic pottery and a careful reader of the <ORGANIZATION>Stolen Art Alert</ORGANIZATION> in "IFAR Reports," knew was stolen.
To confirm <PERSON>Mr. Guy</PERSON>'s identification, <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s and <ORGANIZATION>IFAR</ORGANIZATION> exchanged photos by fax, and the waiting man, apparently innocent of knowledge that the kylix was stolen, agreed to release it.
A former curator of the Museum of Cartoon Art in <LOCATION>Rye Brook</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, pleaded guilty in July to stealing and selling original signed and dated comic strips, among them 29 <PERSON>Dick Tracy</PERSON> strips by <PERSON>Chester Gould</PERSON>, 77 Prince Valiant Sunday cartoons by <PERSON>Hal Foster</PERSON>, and a dozen <ORGANIZATION>Walt Disney</ORGANIZATION> animation celluloids, according to <PERSON>Barbara Hammond</PERSON>, the museum's director.
He sold them well below market value to raise cash "to pay off mounting credit-card debts," incurred to buy presents for his girlfriend, his attorney, <PERSON>Philip Russell</PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION>IFAR</ORGANIZATION>.
The curator, 27-year-old <PERSON>Sherman Krisher</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Greenwich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, had worked his way up from janitor in seven years at the museum.
Instead, <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> police seized the stolen goods, and <PERSON>Mr. Krisher</PERSON> avoided jail.
Authorities at <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Heathrow Airport</LOCATION> are investigating the disappearance of a <PERSON>Paul Gauguin</PERSON> watercolor, "Young Tahitian Woman in a <ORGANIZATION>Red Pareo</ORGANIZATION>," that has two sketches on its verso (opposite) side.
Although <LOCATION>Heathrow</LOCATION> authorities have been watching a group of allegedly crooked baggage handlers for some time, the <PERSON>Gauguin</PERSON> may be "lost." Chief Inspector <PERSON>Peter Seacomb</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Criminal Investigation Department</ORGANIZATION> at the airport said, "It is not uncommon for property to be temporarily mislaid or misrouted." 
It was reported stolen in transit en route to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, in February.
Months later, the <LOCATION>Greek</LOCATION> vase arrived in good condition at the museum in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION>, having inexplicably traveled by a circuitous route through <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION>. 
Two Mexican college dropouts, not professional art thieves, have been arrested for a 1985 Christmas Eve burglary from the <ORGANIZATION>National Museum of Anthropology</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>.
About 140 Mayan, <LOCATION>Aztec</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Mixtec</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Zapotec</ORGANIZATION> objects, including some of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s best-known archaeological treasures, were taken.
As it turned out, <PERSON>Carlos Perches Trevino</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ramon Sardina Garcia</PERSON> had hidden the haul in a closet in the <PERSON>Perches</PERSON> family's home for a year.
Among other happy news bulletins from the German Democratic Republic, the <ORGANIZATION>Leipzig Museum of Fine Arts</ORGANIZATION> announced that it has recovered "Cemetery in the Snow," a painting by the <LOCATION>German Romantic</LOCATION> painter <PERSON>Caspar David Friedrich</PERSON>.
The artist's melancholy subjects bring high prices on the world market, and the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. State Department</ORGANIZATION> notified <ORGANIZATION>IFAR</ORGANIZATION> of the theft in February 1988.
Trompe l'oeil painting is meant to fool the eye, but <PERSON>Robert Lawrence Trotter</PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION>Kennett Square</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, took his fooling seriously.
He painted one himself in the style of <PERSON>John Haberle</PERSON> and sold it as a 19th-century original to antique dealers in <LOCATION>Woodbridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Trotter</PERSON>'s fake <ORGANIZATION>Haberle</ORGANIZATION> was offered at a bargain price of $25,000 with a phony story that it belonged to his wife's late aunt in <LOCATION>New Canaan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn</LOCATION>. 
They persuaded <PERSON>Mr. Trotter</PERSON> to take it back and, with the help of the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION>, taped their conversation with him.
<PERSON>Ms. Lowenthal</PERSON> is executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>International Foundation for Art Research</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>IFAR</ORGANIZATION>). 
<ORGANIZATION>Cetus Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said the government of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> approved the marketing of its Proleukin interleukin-2 drug to treat kidney cancer. 
<ORGANIZATION>Conner Peripherals Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which has a near-monopoly on a key part used in many portable computers, is on target to surpass <ORGANIZATION>Compaq Computer Corp.</ORGANIZATION> as the fastest-growing start-up manufacturing firm in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> business history. 
The company supplies drives to <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Zenith Data Systems</ORGANIZATION>, the top two <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> manufacturers of laptops, and to <ORGANIZATION>Toshiba Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>NEC Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sharp Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the leading Japanese laptop makers. 
"They've had this field to themselves for over a year now, and they've been greatly rewarded," said <PERSON>Bob Katsive</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Disk/Trend Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a market researcher in <LOCATION>Los Altos</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. 
And the Japanese are likely to keep close on <ORGANIZATION>Conner</ORGANIZATION>'s heels. "They are going to catch up," said <PERSON>David Claridge</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Hambrecht & Quist</ORGANIZATION>.
Both <PERSON>Toshiba</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>NEC</ORGANIZATION> already produce hard-disk drives, and <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> also is studying the field, <PERSON>Mr. Claridge</PERSON> said. 
"Most of our competitors are announcing products based on our (older) products," said <PERSON>Finis Conner</PERSON>, chief executive officer and founder of the firm that bears his name. "We continue to develop products faster than anyone else can." These new products could account for as much as 35% of the company's business in 1990, <PERSON>Mr. Conner</PERSON> estimated. "We're not afraid of obsoleting some of our old stuff to stay ahead of the competition," he said. 
From its inception, <ORGANIZATION>Conner</ORGANIZATION> has targeted the market for battery-operated machines, building hard-disk drives that are smaller and use far less power than those offered by competitors such as <ORGANIZATION>Seagate</ORGANIZATION>.
Conner also makes hard-disk drives for desktop computers and is a major supplier to <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION>, which as of July owned 40% of <ORGANIZATION>Conner</ORGANIZATION>'s stock.
Sales to <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION> represented 26% of <ORGANIZATION>Conner</ORGANIZATION>'s business in its third quarter, compared with 42% in the year-ago period. 
On Saturday, the partners said the team would be purchased for $54 million by a new group including <ORGANIZATION>Comsat Video Enterprises Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Communications Satellite Corp.</ORGANIZATION> based here.
<PERSON>Lee</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bynoe</PERSON> putting up $8 million for a 37.5% stake in the team.
<PERSON>Lee</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bynoe</PERSON> last July announced a deal that would have made them the first black principal owners of a major professional sports franchise.
<ORGANIZATION>Comsat Video</ORGANIZATION> is headed by <PERSON>Robert Wussler</PERSON>, who resigned his No. 2 executive post with <ORGANIZATION>Turner Broadcasting System Inc.</ORGANIZATION> just two weeks ago to take the <ORGANIZATION>Comsat</ORGANIZATION> position.
<ORGANIZATION>Comsat Video</ORGANIZATION>, which distributes pay-per-view programs to hotel rooms, plans to add Nuggets games to their offerings, as <PERSON>Mr. Turner</PERSON> did successfully with his <ORGANIZATION>Atlanta Hawks</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Braves</ORGANIZATION> sports teams.
<PERSON>Lee</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bynoe</PERSON> will manage the <ORGANIZATION>Nuggets</ORGANIZATION>' day-today affairs. 
<ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it lowered the ratings of some $145 million of Pinnacle debt because of "accelerating deficiency in liquidity," which it said was evidenced by <ORGANIZATION>Pinnacle</ORGANIZATION>'s elimination of dividend payments.
<PERSON>Henry Sargent Jr.</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Pinnacle</ORGANIZATION> executive vice president, said the action "won't really have any effect on us.
<ORGANIZATION>Moody's</ORGANIZATION> said it also lowered the ratings of $70 million of <ORGANIZATION>Pinnacle</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>MeraBank</ORGANIZATION> thrift unit long-term deposits to B-3 from B-2, and on its subordinated debt to Ca from <LOCATION>Caa</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Burmah Oil PLC</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> independent oil and specialty-chemicals marketing concern, said <ORGANIZATION>SHV Holdings N.V.</ORGANIZATION> has built up a 7.5% stake in the company. 
The holding of 13.6 million shares is up from a 6.7% stake that <LOCATION>Burmah</LOCATION> announced <ORGANIZATION>SHV</ORGANIZATION> held as of last Monday. 
<ORGANIZATION>SHV</ORGANIZATION>, of the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, which last year merged its <LOCATION>North Sea</LOCATION> oil and gas operations with those of <ORGANIZATION>Calor Group PLC</ORGANIZATION> and which owns 40% of Calor, was identified as a possible suitor for <LOCATION>Burmah</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Burmah</PERSON> said it hadn't held any discussions with <ORGANIZATION>SHV</ORGANIZATION> and that "no deal of any nature is in contemplation." 
<PERSON>Greg Davies</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Central Fund</ORGANIZATION>'s vice president, finance, said losses for the fiscal year ending Oct. 31 could be as high as one million Canadian dollars (US$852,000).
In <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading Friday, <ORGANIZATION>Central Fund</ORGANIZATION> was unchanged at $4.6875 a share. 
<ORGANIZATION>ENFIELD Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> that it hopes to raise 56 million Canadian dollars (US$47.7 million) through a rights offering to shareholders.
In <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> trading Friday, <ORGANIZATION>Enfield</ORGANIZATION> closed at C$6.75, down 37.5 cents.
<ORGANIZATION>Pittston</ORGANIZATION> also owns <ORGANIZATION>Brink's Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the security service, and <ORGANIZATION>Burlington Air Express</ORGANIZATION>, the air-freight concern. 
<LOCATION>Burlington</LOCATION>'s operating profit grew to $9.2 million from $3.8 million a year earlier, <ORGANIZATION>Pittston</ORGANIZATION> said.
While "the tone" of domestic and international air-freight markets remains sound, seasonal factors are likely to hinder <ORGANIZATION>Burlington Air</ORGANIZATION> from matching third-quarter results in the fourth quarter, <PERSON>Pittston</PERSON> said. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading Friday, <ORGANIZATION>Pittston</ORGANIZATION> closed at $18.50 a share, down 12.5 cents. 
<PERSON>Roland J. Hawkins</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Jet Vacations Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, was elected to the board of this cruise line.
Amid heavy buying of shares in <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>'s largest insurer, <PERSON>Maurice Lippens</PERSON> also warned in an interview that a white knight, in buying out a raider, could leave speculators with big losses on their <ORGANIZATION>AG</ORGANIZATION> stock.
But <PERSON>Mr. Lippens</PERSON> said a rescue also could involve <ORGANIZATION>Asahi Mutual Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which owns 5% of <ORGANIZATION>AG</ORGANIZATION>. 
In <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, insurers are flirting with banks.
Aside from exploring plans for joint ventures or acquisitions, <PERSON>Mr. Lippens</PERSON> has called top managers of companies rumored as potential raiders -- among them, <PERSON>Axa-Midi</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Union des Assurances de Paris</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Suez</PERSON>, all based in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
A "syndicate" of shareholders holds just under 50% of <ORGANIZATION>AG</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Lippens</PERSON> said, and members have agreed to give one another the right of first refusal should they sell any <ORGANIZATION>AG</ORGANIZATION> shares. 
Aside from <ORGANIZATION>Generale de Belgique</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Asahi</PERSON>, the syndicate includes <PERSON>Antwerpsche Hypotheekkas</PERSON>, a Belgian savings bank, and various family interests. 
A <ORGANIZATION>Generale</ORGANIZATION> spokesman confirmed that the giant Belgian holding company would be willing to raise its stake in <ORGANIZATION>AG</ORGANIZATION> should a raider seek control.
Even without bid talk, this year's surge in prices for <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> real estate has excited interest in <ORGANIZATION>AG</ORGANIZATION>.
Your Oct. 2 article on <PERSON>Daniel Yankelovich</PERSON> cited the quote "A good name is better than great riches" as being from <ORGANIZATION>Cervantes</ORGANIZATION>' "Don Quixote." Actually, <ORGANIZATION>Cervantes</ORGANIZATION> borrowed that quote from a writer of some 25 centuries earlier: <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>King Solomon</PERSON> wrote those words in the Book of Proverbs (22:1). 
<LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> 
The <ORGANIZATION>Forest City</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, maker of motor homes said it had a loss of $11.3 million, or 46 cents a share, in the quarter ended Aug. 26.
The cut in the dividend to 10 cents a share semiannually, from 20 cents, "would indicate to me they don't see the problems being fixed real quick," said <PERSON>Frank Rolfes</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Dain Bosworth Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>.
"It's a large-ticket discretionary purchase," said <PERSON>Robert Curran</PERSON>, who follows the industry for <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION> "So when there's talk and concern about the economy, it's not unreasonable for a portion of the buying public to defer purchases." 
The news sent <LOCATION>Winnebago</LOCATION> stock falling 62.5 cents, to $5.25, in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading-a 52-week low. 
The dividend cut will prove most costly for <PERSON>John K. Hanson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Winnebago</ORGANIZATION>'s founder and chairman.
When the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> upheld <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>'s abortion restrictions last July, the justices almost certainly didn't have drunk driving, trespassing and false imprisonment on their minds. 
<ORGANIZATION>Reproductive Health Services</ORGANIZATION>, illustrates how <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> rulings often have a ripple effect, spreading into areas of law and policy that weren't part of the actual cases decided and that never were contemplated by the justices. 
Last year, a federal appeals court in <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> said the preamble was unconstitutional, citing an earlier <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> ruling that states can't justify stricter abortion curbs by changing the definition of when life begins.
Already, local <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> judges have relied on the restored preamble in two separate cases to throw out criminal trespass charges against anti-abortion demonstrators who blocked access to <ORGANIZATION>Reproductive Health Services</ORGANIZATION>, an abortion clinic in <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>. 
In another case, a protester, <PERSON>Ann O'Brien</PERSON>, was convicted of trespass before the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Webster</PERSON> ruling.
"The effect of the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court Webster</ORGANIZATION> opinion is that it left room for grass to grow in the cracks of <PERSON>Roe</PERSON> vs.
<PERSON>Wade</PERSON>, and I think this is one of the cracks," said <PERSON>Mark Belz</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> lawyer who represented <PERSON>Ms. O'Brien</PERSON> and the other <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> protesters.
<PERSON>Wade</PERSON> was the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>'s 1973 decision that recognized a woman's right to abortion. 
<PERSON>Mario Mandina</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Lawyers for Life</ORGANIZATION>, says that if abortion foes succeed in using the preamble to escape prosecution for trespass, "This will shut down abortion in <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>.
That would be an ironic result of a case in which the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> expressly stopped short of overruling <PERSON>Roe</PERSON> vs.
In one, the lawyer for a 20-year-old resident of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>, who was charged with drunk driving, argued that his client should be treated as a 21-year-old adult because his actual age should be calculated from conception, not from birth.
A <LOCATION>Boone County</LOCATION> judge rejected the motion, but <PERSON>Daniel Dodson</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Jefferson City</LOCATION> lawyer, says he has appealed. 
In a blow to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Rafale</ORGANIZATION> jet fighter, the <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> navy for the first time publicly stated its desire to buy 15 <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas Corp</ORGANIZATION>. F-18 Hornets to defend its aircraft carriers. 
The statement is likely to sharpen the debate within <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s military establishment over the <LOCATION>Rafale</LOCATION>, which is made by <ORGANIZATION>Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA</ORGANIZATION>. 
In an interview in the <ORGANIZATION>navy</ORGANIZATION>'s official weekly magazine <PERSON>Cols Bleus</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>navy</ORGANIZATION>'s second-in-command, Adm. <PERSON>Yves Goupil</PERSON>, said the navy still intends to buy 86 Rafales as scheduled in the late 1990s and early 21st century.
Adm. <PERSON>Goupil</PERSON> said the navy can't wait until 1998, when the naval <PERSON>Rafale</PERSON> becomes available, to replace its obsolete fleet of American-made Crusaders, used since the 1950s to protect carriers from attack.
Rather than renovate the <ORGANIZATION>Crusaders</ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON>Dassault</PERSON> is proposing to do for around 1.8 billion French francs ($286.6 million), Adm. <PERSON>Goupil</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>navy</ORGANIZATION> wants to buy used F-18s from the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Navy</ORGANIZATION>. 
Adm. <PERSON>Goupil</PERSON> said that when the F-18s wear out, the navy is prepared to take <LOCATION>Rafales</LOCATION> to replace them.
But unofficially, senior <ORGANIZATION>navy</ORGANIZATION> officials sharply criticize the <LOCATION>Rafale</LOCATION> as an air force plane ill-suited to carrier use.
Adm. <PERSON>Goupil</PERSON>'s comments are likely to inflame the broader dispute within the military establishment here over the role of <LOCATION>Dassault</LOCATION>.
Although government-controlled, <PERSON>Dassault</PERSON> still is run by the founder's son, Chairman <PERSON>Serge Dassault</PERSON>, who has fiercely protected his company's independence.
The Rafale project is the result of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s inability jointly to develop a plane with other countries, and <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> officials question whether the state can continue paying for expensive independent programs.
Adm. <PERSON>Goupil</PERSON>, a former Crusader squadron leader, said that the last other country to use Crusaders, the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, retired its last ones two years ago.
Adm. <PERSON>Goupil</PERSON> rejected <PERSON>Dassault</PERSON>'s proposal to renovate the Crusaders, saying the cost was impossible to estimate.
Even modernized, he said, the Crusaders represent an obsolete and dangerous protection for the aircraft carriers <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> has sent to meet such crises as the wars in <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION>. 
Defense Minister <PERSON>Jean-Pierre Chevenement</PERSON> told a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>Anglo-American Press Association</ORGANIZATION> that the question of modernizing the Crusaders or buying used F18s is a "political" decision that he will make in due time. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Milwaukee</ORGANIZATION> toy retailer said the agreement calls for Everything's a Dollar holders to receive for their holdings a total of 354,600 newly issued <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> Toy shares.
A company official said <PERSON>Arthur Borie</PERSON>, until January chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION>Pic 'N Save Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, will buy a 20% stake in the new <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> Toy subsidiary, and will act as head of Everything's a Dollar. 
He sent out thousands of news releases from his <LOCATION>Kensington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, office.
But <PERSON>Mr. Lesko</PERSON>'s staff is beginning to wonder whether there isn't some larger phenomenon foiling the contest. "Is the government not helping anybody?" asks <PERSON>Toni Murray</PERSON>, an assistant to <PERSON>Mr. Lesko</PERSON>. 
<LOCATION>Nora Worth</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Malcolm DeWitt</PERSON>, 33 and 39 respectively, live together in a townhouse in a transitional <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> neighborhood.
After all, she reasons, "there were housewives with Nikons and degrees from cooking schools in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> who would kill for her job." But <LOCATION>Nora</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Malcolm</PERSON> feel trapped.
<PERSON>Malcolm</PERSON> faces bankruptcy and an <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> audit, but <ORGANIZATION>Nora</ORGANIZATION> finds an extra $30,000 in her bank account, suddenly increasing her available funds some fifteenfold.
In novels of an earlier vintage, <PERSON>David</PERSON> would have represented excitement and danger; <PERSON>Malcolm</PERSON>, placid, middle-class security.
In making <LOCATION>Malcolm</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Nora</ORGANIZATION> such wonderfully representative specimens of their class and generation, <PERSON>Ms. Zeidner</PERSON> has somewhat neglected the task of making them distinctively individual characters.
In any case, the foundering middle classes aren't the only ones in trouble -- or whose troubles provide material for fiction. "Rascal Money" (Contemporary Books, 412 pages, $17.95), a novel by consultant and business analyst <PERSON>Joseph R. Garber</PERSON>, tells the story of an innovative, well-run, widely respected computer manufacturing company called <ORGANIZATION>PegaSys</ORGANIZATION> as it faces a hostile takeover attempt by <ORGANIZATION>AIW</ORGANIZATION>, a much smaller corporation that is so incompetently managed as to constitute a standing joke in the business world. 
Patrician, dynamic <PERSON>Scott Thatcher</PERSON>, founder and head of <ORGANIZATION>PegaSys</ORGANIZATION>, initially finds the takeover threat risible.
<PERSON>Ms. Rubin</PERSON> is a free-lance writer based in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. 
For bankers and regulators, <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> is looking more like <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> every day. 
On Friday, Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION>First Interstate Bancorp</ORGANIZATION> said it expects a net loss of $16 million for the third quarter of 1989 because of hemorrhaging at its <ORGANIZATION>First Interstate Bank of Arizona</ORGANIZATION> unit.
<ORGANIZATION>First Interstate</ORGANIZATION> said the unit, bludgeoned by <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>'s worsening real-estate woes, will have a $174 million loss for the quarter.
<ORGANIZATION>First Interstate</ORGANIZATION> took a huge $350 million provision for loan losses at the <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> bank.
The action capped a spurt of grim <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> banking news for the third quarter, and emphatically signaled that <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> is challenging <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>'s long reign as banking's busiest graveyard.
<ORGANIZATION>Pinnacle West Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which has been wrangling with regulators for months over what to do about <ORGANIZATION>Pinnacle</ORGANIZATION>'s moribund <ORGANIZATION>Merabank</ORGANIZATION> thrift unit, suspended its dividend and reported a 91% plunge in third-quarter net income.
<ORGANIZATION>Security Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said third-quarter credit losses surged a third to $109 million, mainly because of sour <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> real-estate loans.
Furthermore, the regulatory maneuvering behind <ORGANIZATION>First Interstate</ORGANIZATION>'s loss suggests regulators have concluded that lenders' reserves are far too low to absorb their future <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> losses and are forcing bankers to do something about it.
<ORGANIZATION>Examiners</ORGANIZATION> from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency had been combing through <ORGANIZATION>First Interstate</ORGANIZATION>'s real-estate portfolio since last month; they first recommended that <ORGANIZATION>First Interstate</ORGANIZATION> take a provision that was less than the eventual $350 million third-quarter hit.
"It's horrible to say, but it's unfortunate that earthquake wasn't in <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> -- it might have knocked out some of our empty buildings," said <PERSON>C.W. Jackson</PERSON>, a prominent <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> businessman with interests in real estate, banking and many other businesses. 
<PERSON>Ralph Shattuck</PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION>Foreclosure Update</ORGANIZATION> newsletter, said foreclosures have climbed to about 1,482 a month just in <LOCATION>Maricopa County</LOCATION>, where <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> is located.
<ORGANIZATION>First Interstate</ORGANIZATION> had a $214.4 million loss in 1988's third quarter, mainly from writedowns and reserves connected with its <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> operations.
The bank's <ORGANIZATION>Arizona</ORGANIZATION> unit holds about $6 billion of <ORGANIZATION>First Interstate</ORGANIZATION>'s $50 billion of assets.
<PERSON>Mr. Marrie</PERSON> said the bank expects <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> real-estate prices, which plummeted 40% over the last year, to fall another 20% before stabilizing.
<ORGANIZATION>First Interstate</ORGANIZATION> said its operations outside of <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> "achieved results as expected for the quarter," but didn't specify the results. 
<ORGANIZATION>First Interstate</ORGANIZATION> stock closed at $57.625, down 25 cents, in composite trading Friday on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>.
Since its unsuccessful bid for <ORGANIZATION>BankAmerica Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in 1986, the bank has undertaken a major restructuring in an effort to cut costs and boost performance, but many industry officials believe it may be ripe for a takeover bid, especially with interstate banking set to begin in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> in 1991.
<PERSON>Mr. Marrie</PERSON> said the problems in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> have only "increased our resolve to continue to make our restructuring even more effective." 
Separately, <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor's Corp.</ORGANIZATION> lowered its ratings on <ORGANIZATION>Valley National Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's senior debt to double-B from double-B-plus, affecting about $300 million of long-term debt.
<ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> also lowered ratings on unsecured deposits and issues backed by a letter of credit from the bank holding company's principal unit, <ORGANIZATION>Valley National Bank of Arizona</ORGANIZATION>.
A spokesman for <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, Ariz.-based <ORGANIZATION>Valley National</ORGANIZATION>, said the concern will be able to withstand the current downturn in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> real estate.
Citizens, based in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, said it has about $4.6 billion in factored sales annually; the <ORGANIZATION>Security Pacific</ORGANIZATION> unit has about $1.8 billion annually. 
The top state environmental official in <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> said <ORGANIZATION>Clean Harbors Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's environmental-impact statement for a proposed incinerator in <LOCATION>Braintree</LOCATION> was inadequate. 
<PERSON>Alan McKim</PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Clean Harbors</ORGANIZATION> said he was "very much encouraged" by the official's praise of Clean Harbors for the quality of some of the data in the report. 
Rumors persisted last week that <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s credit ratings -- single-A from <ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and single-A-minus from <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor's Corp.</ORGANIZATION> -- are at risk. 
The weakness in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> bonds follows a warning from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> state Comptroller <PERSON>Edward Regan</PERSON> that the 1987 crash seriously weakened the city's economy.
In a study, the comptroller said, "The city's glory days are over." <PERSON>Mr. Regan</PERSON> warned mayoral candidates "to be prepared for limited options and constraints on service increases to address the city's problems in the next few years, due to the now-evident weakening in the <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> economy." 
"The market can adjust to good news or bad news, but uncertainty drives people wild," said <PERSON>Bernard B. Beal</PERSON>, chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>M.R. Beal & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a securities firm that specializes in the municipal market.
<ORGANIZATION>Heller Financial Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, an indirect subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Fuji Bank Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, shelf offering of up to $1 billion debt securities and warrants. 
<ORGANIZATION>Jason Overseas Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, proposed offering of five million common shares, via <ORGANIZATION>Smith Barney & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mabon Nugent & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>MCI Communications Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, shelf offering of up to $750 million of debt securities via <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Millicom Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, offering of $60 million subordinated exchangeable debentures, via <ORGANIZATION>Bear, Stearns & Co</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Union Tank Car Co.</ORGANIZATION>, offering of $100 million of equipment trust certificates, via <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers</ORGANIZATION>. 
A <ORGANIZATION>Newport Beach</ORGANIZATION> law firm started the pay-as-you-go legal service, called <ORGANIZATION>Telelawyer</ORGANIZATION>, using <ORGANIZATION>MCI Communication Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's toll-tele-phone service.
Though the service is available only in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Telelawyer</ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON>Michael Cane</PERSON> says he plans to franchise it in other states.
A federal court jury in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> found <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>Robert Garcia</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>) and his wife, <PERSON>Jane Lee Garcia</PERSON>, guilty of extorting $76,000 from <ORGANIZATION>Wedtech</ORGANIZATION> in return for official acts by the congressman.
<ORGANIZATION>Wedtech</ORGANIZATION>, which became embroiled in political-corruption cases that eventually led to its demise, formerly was a minority-owned <LOCATION>South Bronx</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, defense contractor.
<PERSON>Edward J.M. Little</PERSON>, one of the assistant <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorneys who prosecuted the case, said the <LOCATION>Garcia</LOCATION> trial "is the last of the <ORGANIZATION>Wedtech</ORGANIZATION> prosecutions." <PERSON>Mr. Little</PERSON> said more than 20 people have been convicted in the <ORGANIZATION>Wedtech</ORGANIZATION> cases, including former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>Mario Biaggi</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>). 
<PERSON>Mr. Garcia</PERSON>, who represents <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s 18th congressional district, which includes the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>, said he hasn't decided whether he will resign. 
"In the next few weeks, I will be consulting with my political advisers and with the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic</ORGANIZATION> leaders about the best way of preserving the interests of my constituents," said <PERSON>Mr. Garcia</PERSON>, 56 years old.
<PERSON>Mrs. Garcia</PERSON>, 49, formerly was a member of <PERSON>Mr. Garcia</PERSON>'s congressional staff. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <PERSON>Judge Leonard B. Sand</PERSON> set the Garcias' sentencing for Jan. 5. 
The new firm, <ORGANIZATION>Hutton Ingram Yuzek Gainen Carroll & Bertolotti</ORGANIZATION>, will be based in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
The five partners who resigned from <ORGANIZATION>Shea & Gould</ORGANIZATION> late last week are <PERSON>Tom Hutton</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sam Ingram</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dean Yuzek</PERSON>, <PERSON>Daniel Carroll</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ernest Bertolotti</PERSON>.
They will be joined by <PERSON>Larry Gainen</PERSON>, who resigned from the firm of <ORGANIZATION>LePatner</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Gainen & Block</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Howard Rubenstein</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> publicist who represents <ORGANIZATION>Shea & Gould</ORGANIZATION>, said, "<ORGANIZATION>Shea & Gould</ORGANIZATION> understands they're leaving because they wanted a different environment -- a smaller firm they would be principals of." <PERSON>Mr. Rubenstein</PERSON> said the five, who weren't on <ORGANIZATION>Shea & Gould</ORGANIZATION>'s management committee, "are leaving on good terms." 
<LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> joins 36 other states that allow public participation in attorney-disciplinary proceedings and 32 states that open disciplinary hearings to the public, according to the <ORGANIZATION>American Bar Association</ORGANIZATION>. 
One vocal critic of the changes, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON>Warren Lupel</PERSON>, says non-lawyers shouldn't be on the inquiry panels because they are unlikely to appreciate the nuances of attorney-client relationships.
Nevertheless, <PERSON>Mr. Lupel</PERSON> anticipates no legal action to reverse the <ORGANIZATION>Illinois Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>'s decision to institute the changes. 
<ORGANIZATION>DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT Inc.</ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay a $50,000 fine to <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, the 26th state to settle with <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> in the wake of the firm's guilty plea to federal insider-trading charges.
<ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> doesn't have a Delaware office, but the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> firm has been negotiating settlements that would allow it to operate freely nationwide despite its record as an admitted felon.
<ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> pleaded guilty in September to six felony counts of securities and mail fraud; it also made a $650 million civil settlement with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> arm of the London-based auction house auctioned off the estate of <PERSON>John T. Dorrance Jr.</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Campbell's Soup Co.</ORGANIZATION> heir, for $131 million last week, a record for a single-owner art collection. 
That total was below the $140 million the auction house estimated the collection might sell for, but was enough to ensure that an unprecedented financial arrangement <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s had made with the <PERSON>Dorrance</PERSON> family proved profitable to the auction house. 
<PERSON>Brown</PERSON> tobacco in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> is a more pungent, stronger grade than the lighter grade, or blonde tobacco, used in so-called American-style cigarettes. 
"We aren't <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris Cos.</ORGANIZATION>," says <PERSON>Bertrand de Galle</PERSON>, chairman of government-owned <ORGANIZATION>Societe Nationale d'Exploitation Industrielle des Tabacs & Allumettes S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, known as <LOCATION>Seita</LOCATION>.
He says that because <ORGANIZATION>Seita</ORGANIZATION>'s profits are limited by government-controlled cigarette prices, he doesn't have the cash to diversify as heavily into food and drink as the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> concern has done. (Last year, for example, <ORGANIZATION>Seita</ORGANIZATION>'s net profit soared 150% to 461.6 million French francs ($73.5 million) on sales of FFr27.68 billion-a 1.7% profit margin.) 
While <PERSON>Seita</PERSON> doesn't own the <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> tabacs, its close alliance with them offers distribution possibilities. 
<LOCATION>Seita</LOCATION> is a partner in the project, which was developed by <ORGANIZATION>Matra SA</ORGANIZATION> using Japanese technology.
<LOCATION>Seita</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Matra</LOCATION> currently are negotiating with city officials for the right to begin service. 
It wanted to buy <ORGANIZATION>RJR Nabisco Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's French cracker subsidiary, <LOCATION>Belin</LOCATION>, in hopes of selling its products in tobacco stores, but lost the bidding to food group <ORGANIZATION>BSN SA</ORGANIZATION>.
While <LOCATION>Seita</LOCATION> retains a manufacturing monopoly in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, it is being hurt by rising imports and from waning cigarette demand. 
So <LOCATION>Seita</LOCATION> has introduced blonde cigarettes under the Gauloises label, and intends to relaunch the unsuccessful <PERSON>Gitanes Blondes</PERSON> in new packaging, similar to the slide-packs used by brown-tobacco <ORGANIZATION>Gitanes</ORGANIZATION>.
The aim, says <PERSON>Mr. de Galle</PERSON>, is to win market share from imported cigarettes, and to persuade smokers who are switching to blonde cigarettes to keep buying <LOCATION>French</LOCATION>. 
Earlier this month, <PERSON>Convex</PERSON> made a bid to outflank other supercomputer competitors like <ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION> by adopting an open set of standards and introducing new hardware and software to link different systems.
The new products allow customers to add Convex machines to established systems made by other manufacturers, which "opens up a phenomenal market for us," said <PERSON>Robert J. Paluck</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Convex</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, president and chief executive. 
<ORGANIZATION>Convex</ORGANIZATION> also recently agreed to use <LOCATION>Posix</LOCATION>, a standard for the computer language called <ORGANIZATION>UNIX</ORGANIZATION>. Posix is one of three or four versions of <ORGANIZATION>UNIX</ORGANIZATION>, but it is increasingly required by the federal government as it tries to standardize its computer systems.
"The market will have to look for a new theme now and that theme will be a return to growth," declares <PERSON>Mary Farrell</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION> analyst.
Among her OTC picks are <PERSON>Oshkosh B'Gosh</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>A&W Brands</ORGANIZATION>.
"You can find some good, quality companies over the counter," but investors should be selective, says <PERSON>John Palicka</PERSON>, chief portfolio manager at <ORGANIZATION>Midco Investors</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, money management company with about $900 million invested in growth stocks of varying sizes.
<PERSON>Mr. Palicka</PERSON>'s picks from the OTC market include Legent, <ORGANIZATION>Mail Boxes Etc.</ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION>Payco American</LOCATION>. 
The main argument for growth stocks is their usually superior performance in a slowing economy. "If the market refocuses on earnings, we should get better valuations of growth stocks," says <PERSON>L. Keith Mullins</PERSON>, a growth-stock analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley</ORGANIZATION>.
The average issue on Standard & Poor's 500-stock Index gained 35% last year, <PERSON>Ms. Farrell</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION> says.
As a result, <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley</ORGANIZATION>'s Index of 40 Emerging Growth Stocks -- most of which are in the OTC market -- is up only 13% for the year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has leaped 24% and the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 has grown 25%.
Some investors are skeptical of growth stocks because investing in them means ignoring that maxim found in the fine print of some investment advertisements -- that past performance isn't indicative of future results. "People are naturally suspicious of them," says <PERSON>Mr. Mullins</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley</ORGANIZATION>.
Among his favorites in his firm's index are <ORGANIZATION>Legent</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Silicon Graphics</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Novell</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mark Schoeppner</PERSON>, portfolio manager at Pittsburgh-based <ORGANIZATION>Quaker Capital Management</ORGANIZATION>, says that in reaction to nervousness about debt-laden buy-out transactions, analysts and investors now appear to be "valuing stock based on future earnings as opposed to the amount of debt the company can support." 
<PERSON>Barney Hallingby</PERSON>, managing director of research at <ORGANIZATION>Hambrecht & Quist</ORGANIZATION>, also believes earnings growth is beginning to play a greater part in investors' buying decisions.
On Friday, <ORGANIZATION>Hambrecht & Quist</ORGANIZATION> added <ORGANIZATION>St. Jude Medical</ORGANIZATION> to the list of 20 stocks it strongly recommends.
<ORGANIZATION>St. Jude</ORGANIZATION>'s market value on <ORGANIZATION>Nasdaq</ORGANIZATION> exceeds $1 billion, so it isn't a small stock.
<PERSON>Kurt Kruger</PERSON>, who follows the stock for <ORGANIZATION>Hambrecht & Quist</ORGANIZATION>, anticipates that the company's net income will grow 51% to $2.15 a share this year.
<ORGANIZATION>BanPonce</ORGANIZATION> jumped 4 1/2 to 47 3/4 after agreeing to be acquired by <ORGANIZATION>Banco Popular de Puerto Rico</ORGANIZATION> for $56.25 a share.
<ORGANIZATION>A Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION> advisory panel has asked that <ORGANIZATION>Medstone</ORGANIZATION> perform more studies on its device to treat gallstones. 
<ORGANIZATION>Qintex Entertainment</ORGANIZATION> dropped 2 5/8 to 1 1/2 after seeking protection from creditor lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code for itself and its two operating subsidiaries, <ORGANIZATION>Hal Roach Studios</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Productions</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>McCaw Cellular Communications</ORGANIZATION> and its target, <ORGANIZATION>LIN Broadcasting</ORGANIZATION>, were active.
<PERSON>McCaw</PERSON> said it has secured commitments from three banks to help finance its $125-a-share bid for 22 million of <LOCATION>Lin</LOCATION>'s shares.
McCaw has called for a "fair auction" of <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION>, which earlier entered a stock-swap merger pact with <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth</ORGANIZATION>. 
The IL-4 receptor is one of five such receptors to be developed and tested by <ORGANIZATION>Receptech Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a spinoff of <LOCATION>Immunex</LOCATION>, through a proposed $30 million initial public offering.
<ORGANIZATION>Immunex</ORGANIZATION> will have the option to buy back <ORGANIZATION>Receptech</ORGANIZATION> shares after five years. 
As a <ORGANIZATION>Channel Islander</ORGANIZATION>, I was amazed to see my birthplace listed as one of "86 countries with an income tax." Despite a history of heated local debate on the topic, my passport clearly reads "British citizen." Whether <PERSON>Mr. McInnes</PERSON>'s oversight is merely a sign of a mainlander's benign neglect is a question my fellow <ORGANIZATION>Channel Islanders</ORGANIZATION> (and friends on the Isle of Man) will continue to ponder. 
In terms of sheer brutality, the <LOCATION>Somali</LOCATION> regime of <PERSON>Siad Barre</PERSON> may rank as No. 1 in the world.
The only reason that <LOCATION>Somalia</LOCATION> remains in obscurity is numbers: a sparsely populated wasteland of 8.5 million people spread out over an expanse nearly the size of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
Up to 500,000 <ORGANIZATION>Somalis</ORGANIZATION> have escaped to the relative safety of Marxist <LOCATION>Ethiopia</LOCATION> because of the behavior of President <PERSON>Barre</PERSON>'s troops. 
In the port of <LOCATION>Berbera</LOCATION>, for example, hundreds of men of the rival <LOCATION>Issak</LOCATION> clan were rounded up in May 1988, imprisoned, and then taken out at night in groups of five to 50 men to be executed without any judicial process whatsoever.
The study was done by <PERSON>Robert Gersony</PERSON>, a consultant to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. State Department</ORGANIZATION> who has years of experience in investigating human-rights abuses on both sides of the left-right ideological divide. 
What gives these events particular significance, however, is the fact that they are part of a wider drama affecting the strategic positions of both the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> on the horn of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.
Desperate, he has called in the Libyans to help fight the rebels of the <ORGANIZATION>Somali National Movement</ORGANIZATION> in the north, which is only one of several groups picking away at the regime in the capital of <LOCATION>Mogadishu</LOCATION>.
Seventy years old and a self-declared "scientific socialist," President <PERSON>Barre</PERSON> has a power base, composed only of his minority <PERSON>Mareham</PERSON> clan, that according to observers is "narrowing." 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>'s interest in <LOCATION>Somalia</LOCATION> consists of a single runway at the port of <LOCATION>Berbera</LOCATION>, which <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military aircraft have the right to use for surveillance of the <LOCATION>Gulf of Aden</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Indian Ocean</LOCATION>.
As long as the rival Soviet-backed regime of <PERSON>Mengistu Haile Mariam</PERSON> held a total gridlock over neighboring <LOCATION>Ethiopia</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> was forced to accept that lonely <LOCATION>Berbera</LOCATION> runway as a distant No. 2 to the Soviets' array of airfields next door.
Recently, in <LOCATION>Wollo</LOCATION> province in the center of <LOCATION>Ethiopia</LOCATION>, Tigrean forces have killed, wounded and captured an additional 20,000 government troops. (Think what these numbers mean -- considering the headline space devoted to hundreds of deaths in <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>, a small country of little strategic importance!) 
Tigrean armies are now 200 miles north of <LOCATION>Addis Ababa</LOCATION>, threatening the town of <LOCATION>Dese</LOCATION>, which would cut off <PERSON>Mr. Mengistu</PERSON>'s capital from the port of <LOCATION>Assab</LOCATION>, through which all fuel and other supplies reach <LOCATION>Addis Ababa</LOCATION>.
As a result, <PERSON>Mr. Mengistu</PERSON> has been forced to transfer thousands of troops from <LOCATION>Eritrea</LOCATION> just to hold the town, thereby risking the loss of even more territory in <LOCATION>Eritrea</LOCATION> only to keep the Tigreans at bay. 
<PERSON>Mr. Mengistu</PERSON> is in an increasingly weak position: Half his army is tied down defending the northern city of <LOCATION>Asmara</LOCATION> from the Eritreans.
What this all means in shorthand is that Soviet dominance in <LOCATION>Ethiopia</LOCATION> is collapsing as fast as President <PERSON>Barre</PERSON>'s regime in <LOCATION>Somalia</LOCATION> is.
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, therefore, has a historic opportunity both to strike a blow for human rights in <LOCATION>Somalia</LOCATION> and to undo the superpower flip-flop of the late 1970s on the Horn of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION>, to its credit, has already begun distancing itself from <PERSON>Mr. Barre</PERSON>, evinced by its decision to publish the Gersony report (which the press has ignored).
Because the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is still perceived to be tied to <PERSON>Mr. Barre</PERSON>, when he goes the runway could go too.
Considering how tenuous the security of that runway is anyway, the better option -- both morally and strategically -- would be for the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration to blast the regime publicly, in terms clear enough for all influential <PERSON>Somalis</PERSON> to understand.
While the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> positions itself for the post-Barre period in <LOCATION>Somalia</LOCATION>, it should continue to back former President <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>'s well-intentioned role as a mediator between <PERSON>Mr. Mengistu</PERSON> and the Eritrean guerrillas in <LOCATION>Ethiopia</LOCATION>, while concomitantly opening up channels of communications with the <LOCATION>Tigrean</LOCATION> rebels through neighboring <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>Ethiopian</LOCATION> politics are the most sophisticated, secretive and Byzantine in all of black <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.
Remember that it took <PERSON>Mr. Mengistu</PERSON> many months, in what became known as the "creeping coup," to topple Emperor <PERSON>Haile Selassie</PERSON> in 1974 and 1975.
But the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> has one great advantage: The Soviets are universally loathed throughout <LOCATION>Ethiopia</LOCATION> for what they did to the country this past decade -- famine and all. 
It's not just in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION> where the march of events is finally on the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> side, but on the horn of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> as well.
The only <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> liability in the region is what remains of the link to <PERSON>Mr. Barre</PERSON>, and that should be cut fast. 
<PERSON>Mr. Kaplan</PERSON>, author of "Surrender or Starve: The Wars Behind the Famine" (<ORGANIZATION>Westview Press</ORGANIZATION>, 1988), lives in <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Dallas Cowboys</ORGANIZATION> are looking at a long-yardage situation, struggling to pull ahead of the <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> Falcons.
Up in his stadium box, their new and controversial owner, <PERSON>Jerral</PERSON> "Jerry" <PERSON>Jones</PERSON>, watches anxiously as the team bounds up to the scrimmage line. 
There in the center of the pack is quarterback <PERSON>Troy Aikman</PERSON>, the key to the <ORGANIZATION>Cowboys</ORGANIZATION>' comeback strategy.
So key, in fact, that <PERSON>Mr. Jones</PERSON> signed him in April for $11.4 million over the next six years -- a record for a rookie. "He's a genuine Wheaties-box athlete," gushes <PERSON>Mr. Jones</PERSON>. 
With three minutes left on the clock, <PERSON>Mr. Aikman</PERSON> takes the snap, steps back and fires a 21-yard pass -- straight into the hands of an <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> defensive back.
The crowd groans, <PERSON>Mr. Jones</PERSON> shakes his head, the <ORGANIZATION>Cowboys</ORGANIZATION> lose the game.
For <PERSON>Mr. Jones</PERSON>, losing his quarterback temporarily was just the latest in a string of setbacks that has beset the <ORGANIZATION>Dallas Cowboys</ORGANIZATION> -- and, this year, much of the <ORGANIZATION>National Football League</ORGANIZATION>.
Nearly half the owners of the 28 <ORGANIZATION>National Football League</ORGANIZATION> teams are losing money, the result of flat attendance, aging stadiums and -- more than anything -- skyrocketing salaries for star players like <PERSON>Mr. Aikman</PERSON>. 
First-round draft picks have done even better: Average salaries and bonuses for them rose to $685,000 this year, up 44% from 1987. "It's a vicious circle," says <PERSON>Art Modell</PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Browns</ORGANIZATION>. "One team pays so much and the other pays more.
Though not intentionally, the <ORGANIZATION>Cowboys</ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON>Mr. Jones</PERSON> has come to represent this new breed of owner. 
Shortly after buying 66% of the team from <LOCATION>H.R.</LOCATION> "Bum" Bright for $145 million, and mindful of the <ORGANIZATION>Cowboys</ORGANIZATION>' ragged bottom line, the 47-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Jones</PERSON> set about his own round of team cuts.
First, he unceremoniously sacked <PERSON>Tom Landry</PERSON>, the legendary coach who took the <ORGANIZATION>Cowboys</ORGANIZATION> to five Super Bowls and 20 consecutive winning seasons.
In <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Landry</PERSON> has a standing just shy of sainthood.
He quickly cut the team's bloated administrative staff by half, shut down a Cowboys-owned dance academy and, in July, announced plans to sell <ORGANIZATION>Valley Ranch</ORGANIZATION>, the team's 30-acre practice camp and the most lavish training facility in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Jones</PERSON> calls the ranch "the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon of Sportdom</ORGANIZATION>." It is a maze of halls that connects film rooms, elaborate spas and weight-training centers that testify to a richer, more free-spending era.
And as for <PERSON>Tom Landry</PERSON>, well, in <PERSON>Mr. Jones</PERSON>'s mind, he had played out his winning years.
An <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> native, he started at guard on the undefeated 1964 <ORGANIZATION>University of Arkansas</ORGANIZATION> team that won a national championship.
After college, he worked at his father's insurance company in <LOCATION>Little Rock</LOCATION>, and in 1966 led an aborted attempt to buy the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Chargers</ORGANIZATION>.
Years later, with cash from the sale of the insurance company, he founded <ORGANIZATION>Arkoma Production Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, an oil and gas exploration company based in <LOCATION>Little Rock</LOCATION>. 
So it wasn't surprising that <PERSON>Mr. Jones</PERSON> returned to his <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> roots when he went looking for a replacement for <PERSON>Mr. Landry</PERSON>.
He tapped <PERSON>Jimmy Johnson</PERSON>, a teammate on the 1964 <ORGANIZATION>University of Arkansas</ORGANIZATION> squad and the head coach at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Miami</ORGANIZATION>, where he led the Hurricanes to five winning seasons and a national championship in 1987.
Whatever <PERSON>Mr. Johnson</PERSON>'s talents, in the hearts and minds of many <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> fans, he is no <PERSON>Tom Landry</PERSON>.
He continues to reshuffle the team, trading famed running back <PERSON>Herschel Walker</PERSON> to the <LOCATION>Minnesota Vikings</LOCATION> this month for a slew of players and future draft picks.
But the general trend, given rising costs in the league, has been to raise prices, and <PERSON>Mr. Jones</PERSON> is expected to eventually follow suit. "It's simple," says <PERSON>Lamar Hunt</PERSON>, who owns the <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Chiefs</ORGANIZATION> and last year raised ticket prices by $2.40 to an average $17. "If we didn't increase prices, we'd be in the red." 
<PERSON>Mr. Jones</PERSON> has also beefed up his marketing staff to sell the 118 luxury suites topping <LOCATION>Texas Stadium</LOCATION> (his deal with Bum Bright included operating rights for the stadium).
Besides signing <PERSON>Mr. Aikman</PERSON> to a sizable contract, <PERSON>Mr. Jones</PERSON> has agreed to pay rookie quarterback <PERSON>Steve Walsh</PERSON> $4.1 million over the next four years. 
Soon, only large corporations will be able to afford to buy and run football teams, predicts <PERSON>John J. Veatch Jr.</PERSON>, an investment banker with <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers</ORGANIZATION> who handled the <ORGANIZATION>Cowboys</ORGANIZATION> sale.
"We have the worst lease in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>," contends <PERSON>Michael B. McCaskey</PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Bears</ORGANIZATION> and a grandson of <PERSON>George Halas</PERSON>, who founded the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s predecessor organization. "We're in a metro area with millions of Bear fans, and only a small number can be accommodated." When the lease expires in 1999, he says, "It's got to be changed." 
An <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> spokesman also says the league will probably expand its offerings to cable TV companies like <ORGANIZATION>ESPN</ORGANIZATION>. 
The new breed of team owner, <PERSON>Mr. Jones</PERSON> included, has been fighting the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> bureaucracy for a greater say in league affairs, and the battle has produced a form of organizational gridlock.
In July, 11 <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> owners, almost all of them new, blocked an effort to install <PERSON>Jim Finks</PERSON> as a replacement for retiring league commissioner <PERSON>Pete Rozelle</PERSON>.
To keep his schedule on track, he flies two personal secretaries in from <LOCATION>Little Rock</LOCATION> to augment his staff in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>. 
Owning the <ORGANIZATION>Cowboys</ORGANIZATION> has bought him entree to a glitzy life that drilling for oil in <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> just didn't provide.
There is the new private jet, the platoon of assistants, invitations to the best parties, and television appearances on shows such as "Prime Time Live." A few weeks ago, <PERSON>Mr. Jones</PERSON> even entertained <PERSON>Elizabeth Taylor</PERSON> in his private suite at <LOCATION>Texas Stadium</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to raise to $6 billion from $3 billion the amount of money <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Dick Cheney</PERSON> may shift among the Pentagon's individual programs, projects and activities, allowing him to ease the pain that the Gramm-Rudman budget law was intended to inflict. 
If the request is approved by both the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Cheney</PERSON> would need only permission from the <ORGANIZATION>White House Office of Management</ORGANIZATION> and Budget to move the money, according to <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> budget analysts. 
That would give the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> flexibility that no other federal agency has. "It's simply a way of making the cuts less onerous for defense than they are for domestic programs," said Chairman <PERSON>James Sasser</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>) of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Budget Committee</ORGANIZATION>, who said he would oppose the request. "That isn't consistent with the kind of discipline that <PERSON>Gramm-Rudman</PERSON> is supposed to impose," he said. 
<PERSON>David Baltimore</PERSON>, who has just been named president of <ORGANIZATION>Rockefeller University</ORGANIZATION>, already knows what it's like to go through life with "Nobel laureate" appended to one's name.
Both of <PERSON>Dr. Baltimore</PERSON>'s public faces have been on view the past few weeks while he was under consideration to succeed <PERSON>Joshua Lederberg</PERSON> as head of the prestigious <ORGANIZATION>Rockefeller</ORGANIZATION> research institution.
It came to light that a substantial number of <ORGANIZATION>Rockefeller</ORGANIZATION>'s faculty were upset over or even opposed to <PERSON>Dr. Baltimore</PERSON>'s impending appointment. 
They were disturbed at what they regarded as <PERSON>Dr. Baltimore</PERSON>'s confrontational attitude toward the <PERSON>Dingell</PERSON> committee, which held hearings on a dispute over the lab notebooks of a researcher who had co-authored a scientific paper with <PERSON>Dr. Baltimore</PERSON>.
Readers of these columns ("The Science Police," May 15) will recall that <PERSON>Dr. Baltimore</PERSON> was merely the most well-known part of the <PERSON>Dingell</PERSON> committee's larger investigation, which touched <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION>, Tufts, <PERSON>Duke</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Institutes of Health</ORGANIZATION> and elsewhere.
Rep. <PERSON>Dingell</PERSON> even managed to enlist the services of the <ORGANIZATION>Secret Service</ORGANIZATION> in his investigation of the <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> paper. 
Insofar as <PERSON>Mr. Dingell</PERSON> has a special interest in <ORGANIZATION>NIH</ORGANIZATION> and the institutions that receive its funding, the Rockefeller scientists were no doubt discomfited by <PERSON>Dr. Baltimore</PERSON>'s unflattering public opinion of this congressional patron, whose behavior reminded <PERSON>Dr. Baltimore</PERSON> of the <PERSON>McCarthy</PERSON> era. 
This well may be the first time that the venerable <ORGANIZATION>Rockefeller University</ORGANIZATION> has brushed up publicly against the intimidations now common in <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> science.
<PERSON>John Dingell</PERSON> demagogues a <PERSON>David Baltimore</PERSON>, animal-rights activists do $3.5 million of damage to labs at the U.Cal-Davis, <PERSON>Meryl Streep</PERSON> decries the horrors of chemistry on talk shows, <PERSON>Jeremy Rifkin</PERSON> files lawsuits in federal court to thwart biotech experiments, and Dutch-elm-disease researcher <PERSON>Gary Strobel</PERSON>'s own colleagues at <LOCATION>Montana State</LOCATION> denounce him for "violating" <ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION> rules. 
<PERSON>David Hubel</PERSON>, a Nobel laureate at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION>, has taken the lead in defending research with animals, as has <PERSON>Dr. Michael DeBakey</PERSON>.
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> defended itself vigorously and successfully against a <LOCATION>Rifkin</LOCATION> suit to block the <LOCATION>Galileo</LOCATION> launch. 
<ORGANIZATION>Qintex Australia Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> encountered another setback Friday when its Los Angeles-based affiliate, <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Entertainment Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Bankruptcy Code. 
<ORGANIZATION>Qintex Entertainment</ORGANIZATION> also said <PERSON>David Evans</PERSON>, its president and chief executive, and <PERSON>Roger Kimmel</PERSON>, a director, both resigned.
Earlier this month, <LOCATION>Qintex Australia</LOCATION>'s $1.5 billion agreement to acquire <ORGANIZATION>MGM/UA Communications Co.</ORGANIZATION> collapsed because of a dispute over a $50 million letter of credit the Australian operator of television stations and resorts was to have supplied as security in the transaction.
<ORGANIZATION>Qintex Entertainment</ORGANIZATION>, a producer and distributor of television programs most noted for its co-production of the hit miniseries "Lonesome Dove," said it filed for Chapter 11 protection after Qintex <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> failed to provide it with $5.9 million owed to <ORGANIZATION>MCA Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in connection with the distribution of "The New Leave It to Beaver Show." 
<ORGANIZATION>Qintex Entertainment</ORGANIZATION> is 43% owned by <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Australia</ORGANIZATION> and said it relies on the Australian company for funding its working capital requirements. 
<PERSON>Jonathan Lloyd</PERSON>, executive vice president and chief financial officer of <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Entertainment</ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Entertainment</ORGANIZATION> was forced to file for protection to avoid going into default under its agreement with <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> on Friday said that as a result of <ORGANIZATION>Qintex</ORGANIZATION>'s failure to make the required payment it was terminating the distribution agreement on "The New Leave It to Beaver" as well as other <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> properties. 
<PERSON>Mr. Lloyd</PERSON> said both <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Entertainment</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Australia</ORGANIZATION> had attempted to secure a loan that would allow the company to make the $5.9 million payment but the request was turned down by an unidentified lender on Oct. 14.
In a prepared statement from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, the company also said that, following the breakdown of the <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION> talks, it "had been re-evaluating its position as a significant shareholder and a substantial creditor of Qintex Entertainment" and had "resolved to minimize the degree of further loans to <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Entertainment</ORGANIZATION> in excess of that previously made." 
The report of the bankruptcy filing stunned <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION> executives and investors. "It's a shocker," said <PERSON>Joseph Di Lillo</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Drake Capital Securities</ORGANIZATION>, a brokerage firm that has an investment in <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Entertainment</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Qintex</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Mr. Evans</PERSON>, the former president, resigned for "personal reasons" and that <PERSON>Mr. Kimmel</PERSON>, an attorney, resigned because his participation in evaluating the company's role in buying MGM/UA was no longer necessary.
It's understood that MGM/UA recently contacted <PERSON>Rupert Murdoch</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which made two failed bids for the movie studio, to see if the company was still interested.
It isn't a current topic of conversation at the company," said <PERSON>Barry Diller</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION>Fox Inc.</ORGANIZATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION>News Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <LOCATION>Weston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, utilities and marine-transport concern said results for the third quarter, usually a money-losing one because of the seasonality of the gas business, were also aided by higher gas sales and the May 1989 acquisition of Water Products Company. 
Dow, of <LOCATION>Midland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, said its unit will begin by Thursday a tender offer of $12.25 a share for all <ORGANIZATION>PSE</ORGANIZATION> common shares outstanding.
Among other conditions, the offer depends on the <ORGANIZATION>Dow</ORGANIZATION> unit acquiring at least 66 2/3% of the <ORGANIZATION>PSE</ORGANIZATION> shares outstanding, the companies said in a joint statement Friday. 
Dow said it already has agreements with <PERSON>Albert J. Smith Jr.</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>PSE</ORGANIZATION>, and certain other officers of the company under which <ORGANIZATION>Dow</ORGANIZATION> may buy about 40% of the <ORGANIZATION>PSE</ORGANIZATION> common shares outstanding. 
The company is owner and operator, or an equity partner, in six cogeneration facilities -- two in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and four in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. 
As they stumble and bumble toward election day two weeks from tomorrow, both Democrat <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON> and Republican <PERSON>Rudolph Giuliani</PERSON> are in trouble. 
<PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> borough president, can afford more bumbling and stumbling because he holds a comfortable 20-point lead in most of the public-opinion polls.
"<PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> is a decent but sloppy guy," says <PERSON>David Garth</PERSON>, veteran campaign consultant here who has always worked for <PERSON>Mayor Edward Koch</PERSON>, defeated by <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON> in the Sept. 12 Democratic primary. "The alternative -- <PERSON>Giuliani</PERSON> -- is ghastly." 
"I guess we'll reluctantly go ahead and do it, vote for <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON>," says <PERSON>Richard Wade</PERSON>, a politically active professor who supported <PERSON>Richard Ravitch</PERSON>, an also-ran in the Democratic primary. "There's nothing on the other side." 
"We're picking up steam," insists <PERSON>Roger Ailes</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Giuliani</PERSON>'s media consultant, whose last big campaign helped put <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> in the White House.
For, just as <PERSON>Mr. Giuliani</PERSON> latches on to an issue that has <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON> reeling, his campaign desperately needs cash to keep <PERSON>Mr. Ailes</PERSON>'s commercials on the air beyond Wednesday or Thursday.
To help out this week, the White House is dispatching chief of staff <PERSON>John Sununu</PERSON> and three Cabinet members -- <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Jack Kemp</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Transportation</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Samuel Skinner</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Nicholas Brady</PERSON>, according to <PERSON>Peter Powers</PERSON>, the <PERSON>Giuliani</PERSON> campaign manager. 
"People weren't so happy in the 1930s," says <PERSON>Thomas Lessner</PERSON>, another local professor and the biographer of the legendary <PERSON>Fiorello LaGuardia</PERSON>, the city's fusion mayor who built a coalition <PERSON>Mr. Giuliani</PERSON> hopes to emulate. "But, at least, back then they didn't generally direct their anger at each other." 
The 62-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON>, an ex-Marine, has served as the city clerk and as <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> borough president, a job with limited executive responsibilities ("I defy you to come up with one major accomplishment of <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON>," says <PERSON>Mr. Giuliani</PERSON>.) 
The 45-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Giuliani</PERSON> has run a negative campaign to pick up votes leaning to <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON>. "He's got to get <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON>'s negatives up," says <PERSON>Lee Miringoff</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Marist College Institute of Public Opinion</ORGANIZATION>. "But our polls show voters don't like the attack stuff.
"It's assault-weapons politics," says <PERSON>John Siegal</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON>'s issues director, insisting there is a strong racist undertone to the <PERSON>Giuliani</PERSON> effort. 
On the one hand, <PERSON>Mr. Giuliani</PERSON> wants to cut into <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON>'s credibility.
It hasn't helped that he's waffled on abortion and gay rights, sought the support of both the <ORGANIZATION>Liberal and Conservative</ORGANIZATION> parties (he won the <ORGANIZATION>Liberal</ORGANIZATION> endorsement) and that he turned to comedian <PERSON>Jackie Mason</PERSON> for help with Jewish voters.
<PERSON>Mr. Mason</PERSON> left the campaign after telling reporters <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON> is "a fancy 'shvartzer' with a moustache." Shvartzer is a derogatory Yiddish word for a black person. 
He can match <PERSON>Jackie Mason</PERSON> with his own <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> "Sonny" <PERSON>Carson</PERSON>, an angry street organizer who was convicted of kidnapping in 1974.
The <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> campaign paid <PERSON>Mr. Carson</PERSON> close to $10,000 to get out the vote on primary-election day.
And now he's busily trying to explain an arrangement in which he sold stock in <ORGANIZATION>Inner City Broadcasting Co.</ORGANIZATION>, headed by his old friend and patron, <PERSON>Percy Sutton</PERSON>, to his son, <PERSON>David Dinkins Jr.</PERSON>, for $58,000.
"It looks like serious tax evasion," says <PERSON>Mr. Ailes</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Giuliani</LOCATION> media consultant. "It follows the same pattern as his tax returns.
"He simply hasn't explained why something worth a million dollars ended up worth $58,000 two years later," says <PERSON>Mr. Powers</PERSON>, the <PERSON>Giuliani</PERSON> campaign manager. "It's ludicrous for him to suggest it's the difference between the 'breakup' value of the shares and their market value." 
So far though, no one -- not even former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney <PERSON>Giuliani</PERSON> -- has been able to pinpoint just what law <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON> has broken or just what tax he has evaded. 
"The crime goes to character," says <PERSON>Ron Maiorana</PERSON>, a consultant to the <PERSON>Giuliani</PERSON> campaign. "It's serious stuff.
Royal contends that Realist failed to disclose material information, including <ORGANIZATION>Realist</ORGANIZATION>'s negotiations to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Ammann Laser Technik AG</ORGANIZATION>, to stockholders prior to <ORGANIZATION>Realist</ORGANIZATION>'s June 6 annual meeting.
<ORGANIZATION>Royal</ORGANIZATION>'s suit contends that the <ORGANIZATION>Ammann</ORGANIZATION> acquisition was "designed to entrench management and thwart <ORGANIZATION>Royal</ORGANIZATION>'s offer." 
Royal withdrew its offer to buy <ORGANIZATION>Realist</ORGANIZATION>, a maker of optical and electronic products based in <LOCATION>Menomonee Falls</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION>, for $14.06 a share in July after <ORGANIZATION>Realist</ORGANIZATION> disclosed the <ORGANIZATION>Ammann</ORGANIZATION> purchase.
Former <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> Ambassador <PERSON>Jeane Kirkpatrick</PERSON>, in a <ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION> "Capital Gang" discussion Oct. 7 of <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> action on federal catastrophic-illness insurance: 
Although major <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> manufacturers have all but ceded the main segment of that future business to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, not everyone here is ready to give up. 
<ORGANIZATION>Photonics Technology Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Northwood</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, aims to use a new form of plasma technology to put movie-quality images on a TV display that is 40 inches in diameter but only a few inches thick. 
<ORGANIZATION>Planar Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Beaverton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, the largest of these firms, with $20 million in annual revenue, has similar plans.
Two other firms, <ORGANIZATION>Ovonic Imaging Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Troy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Magnascreen Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> are developing a variation of the flat-panel screens called active-matrix liquid crystal displays. 
Large <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies are interested in other segments of the <ORGANIZATION>HDTV</ORGANIZATION> business, such as signal-processing and broadcast equipment.
But except for <ORGANIZATION>Zenith Electronics Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which is collaborating with <LOCATION>Toshiba</LOCATION> on computer displays, they are poorly positioned to exploit advances in large panels.
<ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> recently sold off its interests in liquid-crystal displays to Thompson-CSF of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. "We found the market not developing as we thought it would," a GE spokesman says. 
The small <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> firms are persisting because of their strong positions in patents, and because the prize is still there to be seized. "No one yet has shown the ability to manufacture these panels" at commercial costs, says <PERSON>Zvi Yaniv</PERSON>, the president of Ovonic Imaging.
The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration, hearing conflicting advice about what its role in <ORGANIZATION>HDTV</ORGANIZATION> should be, isn't doing much for now.
The only material support it is extending to the struggling <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> industry is $30 million in awards from the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</ORGANIZATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>DARPA</ORGANIZATION> funds are a pittance compared with what <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and other prospective competitors are spending.
The <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> estimates that Japanese government and industry spending on <ORGANIZATION>HDTV</ORGANIZATION> research is already over $1 billion. 
"Unless it gets more help, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> industry won't have a chance," says <PERSON>Peter Friedman</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Photonics</ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president. 
But <PERSON>Peter Brody</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magnascreen</ORGANIZATION>'s president, says Japanese companies are poised to snatch the technology and put it to commercial use, just as they did with earlier <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> innovations in color television and video recording. 
In the 1970s, <PERSON>Mr. Brody</PERSON> helped develop the first display panels based on active-matrix liquid crystals at <ORGANIZATION>Westinghouse Electric Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's research labs in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>.
Many critics question the industry's need for federal support; the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> justifies its help on national-security grounds. "We don't see a domestic source for some of our {HDTV} requirements, and that's a source of concern," says <PERSON>Michael Kelly</PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION>DARPA</ORGANIZATION>'s defense manufacturing office.
The <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> is ordering displays for its Aegis cruisers and the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> wants smaller versions for its Abrams battle tanks. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> also is trying to encourage <ORGANIZATION>HDTV</ORGANIZATION> because of the benefits that could spin off to the semiconductor and computer industries. "It isn't just yuppie television," argues <PERSON>Jack Clifford</PERSON>, director of the department's office of microelectronics and instrumentation. "The industry will create industrial products such as displays for work stations and medical diagnostic equipment before it acquires a mass consumer market." 
Although some <ORGANIZATION>HDTV</ORGANIZATION> advocates are calling for other forms of aid, such as antitrust relief for research consortia, the small firms simply would prefer more <ORGANIZATION>DARPA</ORGANIZATION> funds.
They also want <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade policy to reflect the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Commerce department</ORGANIZATION>'s concern over their future.
They all are strongly opposed to a petition from several Japanese TV manufacturers, including <ORGANIZATION>Matsushita</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Hitachi</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Toshiba</LOCATION>, to exempt portable color TVs with liquid-crystal displays from anti-dumping duties that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> imposes on the larger Japanese color TVs. 
Planar President <PERSON>James Hurd</PERSON> says he has to pay tariffs as high as 15% to sell his display panels in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>, while panels from those countries enter the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> duty-free. 
<ORGANIZATION>The Office of Thrift Supervision</ORGANIZATION> banned <PERSON>B.J. Garman</PERSON>, a former director of the failed <ORGANIZATION>Vision Banc Savings Association of Kingsville</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, from working in any financial institution insured by the government. 
The office, a <ORGANIZATION>Treasury Department</ORGANIZATION> unit that is the successor to the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Home Loan Bank Board</ORGANIZATION>, said this was the first announcement of an enforcement action since this year's thrift-bailout legislation ordered that all such actions by federal banking regulators be made public. 
<ORGANIZATION>Vision Banc</ORGANIZATION> was placed in government conservatorship in March, and it operates under the control of the <ORGANIZATION>Resolution Trust Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the agency created to sell or liquidate insolvent thrifts. 
The <ORGANIZATION>OTS</ORGANIZATION> didn't say specifically why the action was taken against <PERSON>Ms. Garman</PERSON>.
But industry and <ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION> officials agree that a handful of members still have enough unused capacity to glut the market and cause an oil-price collapse a few months from now if <ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION> doesn't soon adopt a new quota system to corral its chronic cheaters. 
<ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION> is currently producing more than 22 million barrels a day, sharply above its nominal, self-imposed fourth-quarter ceiling of 20.5 million, according to <ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION> and industry officials at an oil conference here sponsored by the Oil Daily and the <ORGANIZATION>International Herald Tribune</ORGANIZATION>.
Most is concentrated in five <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> countries, including his own, <PERSON>Issam Al-Chalabi</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>'s oil minister, told the conference Friday.
<PERSON>Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>'s oil minister, recently estimated <ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION> capacity at 25 million barrels a day. 
Even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves, such as <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>, could upset the market. 
The Iraqi oil minister and <LOCATION>Saudi</LOCATION> oil minister <PERSON>Hisham Nazer</PERSON> insisted in their comments to the conference that their countries would act responsibly to maintain a stable market. 
Under that approach, countries with the most unused oil capacity would get bigger shares of any future increases in <ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION>'s production ceiling than they would under the current system. "If you are already producing at 95% or 100% of your capacity, what's the good to be told you can produce at 105% of capacity?" asked <PERSON>Mr. Al-Chalabi</PERSON>. 
At an inconclusive <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> meeting late last month, <ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION>'s oil ministers halfheartedly approved another increase of one million barrels a day in their production ceiling.
<LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> accepted <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s proposal only so long as it was promised production parity with <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>.
The ceiling would be lifted to 21.5 million barrels to provide <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United Arab Emirates</LOCATION> much higher official quotas while reducing percentage shares of some others.
<LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>'s previous conditions are no longer considered a problem, although the <LOCATION>United Arab Emirates</LOCATION> is still an issue. 
<LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION>'s kingpin, also has surfaced as a possible obstacle, some <ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION> sources said.
In <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION>, however, they supported <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s proposal because it would have left the Saudi percentage of the <ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION> total intact, and increased actual <LOCATION>Saudi</LOCATION> volume to nearly 5.3 million barrels daily from five million. 
<PERSON>Mr. Nazer</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Saudi</LOCATION> oil minister, reiterated here that the kingdom would insist on maintaining its percentage share of <ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION> production under any quota revisions. "Under any circumstances, <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> should get more" rather than less, <PERSON>Mr. Nazer</PERSON> said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Givaudan Far East Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a Swiss concern that sells chemicals to shampoo and soap factories in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, typifies the problems.
In <LOCATION>Canton</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Givaudan</PERSON>'s representative office received no orders in June.
The consumer-products and light-industrial sectors are bearing the brunt of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s austerity measures, and foreign companies such as <LOCATION>Givaudan</LOCATION> that deal with those industries are being hit the hardest.
"The import pie will shrink," says <PERSON>John Kamm</PERSON>, first vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>American Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> and a <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> trade specialist. "On the down side, sales could fall as much as 90% for some companies; on the upper side, sales will be flat." <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s foreign trade has gone in cycles during the past decade.
"The freeze on new lending is dealing the single biggest blow to trading," says <PERSON>Raymond Wong</PERSON>, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> manager for <ORGANIZATION>Mannesmann AG</ORGANIZATION>, a West German machinery-trading company. 
<LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>'s periodic clampdowns on imports have taught many trading companies that the best way to get through the drought is by helping <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> export.
For example, <ORGANIZATION>Nissho Iwai Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, one of the biggest Japanese trading houses, now buys almost twice as many goods from <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> as it sells to that country.
But the strategy isn't helping much this time. "Both sectors of imports and exports look just as bad," says <PERSON>Masahiko Kitamura</PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION>Nissho Iwai</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Canton</LOCATION> office.
<ORGANIZATION>Shanghai Investment & Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION>Sitco</ORGANIZATION>, is the city's main financier for trading business.
"It has difficulties paying its foreign debts," says a <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> executive who is familiar with <ORGANIZATION>Sitco</ORGANIZATION>'s business. "How can it make available funds for purchases?" 
<PERSON>Mr. Kamm</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> trade expert, estimates that as much as 50% of <LOCATION>Guangdong</LOCATION>'s exports is made up of processed imported raw materials. 
<ORGANIZATION>Comair Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> that it bought <ORGANIZATION>Airline Aviation Academy</ORGANIZATION>, a pilot training school based at <ORGANIZATION>Sanford Regional Airport</ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION>Orlando</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Comair Holdings</ORGANIZATION> is the parent of <ORGANIZATION>Comair Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a regional air carrier. 
<ORGANIZATION>Airline Aviation</ORGANIZATION>, which has annual revenue of $5 million to $6 million, has great growth potential because of the large number of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> pilots nearing retirement age, <ORGANIZATION>Comair</ORGANIZATION> said.
The unit will be renamed <ORGANIZATION>Comair Aviation Academy</ORGANIZATION> and will continue to be headed by <PERSON>Scott Williams</PERSON>, a son of its founder, <PERSON>Comair</PERSON> said. 
Through a separate agreement between <PERSON>Peter Dauchy</PERSON>, president, and a group of selling shareholders, the company said, <PERSON>Mr. Dauchy</PERSON> will on Oct. 30 buy 231,405 shares from the group, boosting his stake to about 717,000 shares, or 50.7% of the total after the buy-back. 
The collapse of a $6.79 billion buy-out of <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION> has handed Wall Street's takeover stock speculators their worst loss ever on a single deal. 
Their $700 million-plus in estimated paper losses easily tops the $400 million in paper losses the takeover traders, known as arbitragers, suffered in 1982 when <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Oil Co.</ORGANIZATION> dropped a $4.8 billion offer for <ORGANIZATION>Cities Service Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
In the six trading days since the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> labor-management buy-out group failed to get bank financing, culminating Friday with the withdrawal of its partner <ORGANIZATION>British Airways PLC</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stock has plummeted by 41% to 168 1/2 from 285 1/4. 
The arbs may recoup some of their paper losses if the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> deal gets patched up again, as they did in 1982 when <ORGANIZATION>Occidental Petroleum Co.</ORGANIZATION> rescued them with a $4 billion takeover of <ORGANIZATION>Cities Service</ORGANIZATION>. 
However, investment bankers say that banks aren't likely to lend the almost $5 billion that would be necessary for a takeover even at a lower price without someone putting up a hefty wad of cash -- probably even greater than the 17% in cash put up by investors in the leveraged takeover of <ORGANIZATION>Northwest Airlines</ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION>NWA Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in July. 
Investors such as <PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> who have sought airline ownership this year have insisted they, not the pilots, must have control. 
In advising the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> board on the various bids for the airline, starting with one for $240 a share from <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON>, the investment bank of <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION> came up with a wide range of potential values for the company, depending on appraisal methods and assumptions. 
Using the the <ORGANIZATION>NWA</ORGANIZATION> takeover as a benchmark, <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 14 estimated that <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> was worth $250 to $344 a share based on <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>'s results for the 12 months ending last June 30, but only $235 to $266 based on a management estimate of results for 1989.
Using estimates of the company's future earnings under a variety of scenarios, <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION> estimated <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>'s value at $248 to $287 a share if its future labor costs conform to Wall Street projections; $237 to $275 if the company reaches a settlement with pilots similar to one at <ORGANIZATION>NWA</ORGANIZATION>; $98 to $121 under an adverse labor settlement, and $229 to $270 under a pilot contract imposed by the company following a strike. 
And using liquidation value assuming the sale of all <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> assets, <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION> estimated the airline is worth $253 to $303 a share. 
<ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>USAir Group</ORGANIZATION>, both subject to takeover efforts themselves, have each warned of declining results. 
<PERSON>Frank Gallagher</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Phoenix Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, estimates that the arbs paid an average of about $280 a share for their <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> positions.
<ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Saab-Scania</LOCATION> AB of <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> broke off talks about a possible alliance after <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> officials concluded that the cost to modernize <PERSON>Saab</PERSON>'s car operations would outweigh the likely return. 
With the collapse of the talks Friday, European analysts expect <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> to intensify its pursuit of British luxury car maker <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar PLC</ORGANIZATION>, which is scrambling to fend off a hostile <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> bid by negotiating a friendly alliance with <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s archrival, <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Saab</ORGANIZATION> officials declined to elaborate publicly on the announcement Friday that their negotiations failed to yield an agreement "that could make long-term business sense to both parties." 
Individuals close to the <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> side of the negotiations said late last week that the No. 2 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auto maker lost interest as it became clear that the Swedish auto maker's automotive operations had little to offer in the way of image or technology.
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> originally had seen a Saab alliance as a way to expand its presence in the <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> luxury car markets.
In addition, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Saab</PERSON> had discussed a possible link between their heavy truck operations. 
Some European analysts speculated that officials of <LOCATION>Saab</LOCATION>'s highly profitable <LOCATION>Scania</LOCATION> truck operation balked at surrendering any of their autonomy. 
Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> officials became convinced they couldn't expect to recover the investment it would require to make <PERSON>Saab</PERSON>'s cars competitive in the increasingly crowded luxury market. 
<LOCATION>Saab</LOCATION>'s problems were underscored Friday when the company announced that its car division had a 1.2 billion kronor ($186.1 million) loss during the first eight months of this year, slightly worse than <LOCATION>Saab-Scania</LOCATION> had forecast in its first-half report last month.
Industry analysts in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> said the most likely suitor for <LOCATION>Saab</LOCATION> now is <ORGANIZATION>Fiat</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Saab</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Fiat</ORGANIZATION> have worked together in the past, in one case developing jointly a new auto chassis that became the foundation of <LOCATION>Saab</LOCATION>'s 9000 model, <ORGANIZATION>Fiat</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Croma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Lancia</LOCATION>'s Thema.
Last month, <LOCATION>Saab-Scania</LOCATION> Chief Executive <PERSON>Georg Karnsund</PERSON> said his company has had talks with <ORGANIZATION>Fiat</ORGANIZATION> about a broader alliance.
As for <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>, analysts expect the end of the <LOCATION>Saab</LOCATION> play will allow the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auto maker to focus its resources on the intensifying struggle with <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> for a stake in <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>. 
The failure of the <LOCATION>Saab</LOCATION> talks "makes it even more crucial for {<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>} to be victorious" in the <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> contest, said <PERSON>Stephen Reitman</PERSON>, European auto industry analyst at <ORGANIZATION>UBS-Phillips & Drew</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> faces an uphill fight for <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, however.
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> executives said last week they expect to have a friendly alliance with <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> wrapped up by the end of the month.
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, is hosting a delegation of members of the <ORGANIZATION>British Parliament</ORGANIZATION> who are touring the auto maker's headquarter operations in <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>.
A <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the visit isn't connected to the <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> situation. 
But <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> clearly views <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> as a prize worth fighting for, since the company's gilded brand image would give <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> a badly needed leg up in the high end of the luxury markets in both <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Last week, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> encountered a setback in its effort to broaden its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> luxury offerings when it was forced to abandon a four-year-old effort to market its German-built Scorpio sedan in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> as a luxury import under the Merkur brand name. 
So despite the GM-Jaguar romance, analysts say <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> by last Friday had boosted its <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> holding to about 11% of the luxury auto maker's shares outstanding from 10.4% early last week.
About 5.4 million <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shares changed hands in active trading on <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s stock exchange Friday, and <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shares moved up 19 pence to 696 pence ($11).
On the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> over-the-counter market, <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s American depositary receipts rose 12.5 cents to $11.125. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ekco Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Nashua</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.H.</LOCATION>, expects to report that net income in the third quarter, ended Oct. 1, fell 50% to 60% from $2.1 million, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier. 
<PERSON>Robert Stein</PERSON>, president and chief executive officer, attributed the expected decline partly to the effects of a two-week strike last month at the company's <LOCATION>Masillon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, bakeware facility.
<PERSON>Mr. Stein</PERSON> said <PERSON>Woodstream</PERSON> is "marginally profitable" but hasn't performed as well as expected.
<PERSON>Mr. Stein</PERSON> said he expects profit to be higher in 1990 than in 1989, reflecting a number of measures taken since the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Ekco Housewares</ORGANIZATION> in late 1987. (Prior to acquiring the housewares business, the company was known as <ORGANIZATION>Centronics Corp.</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Centronics</ORGANIZATION> had been a maker of computer printers, but <PERSON>Mr. Stein</PERSON> and other officers decided to sell that business after Japanese competitors grabbed a dominant share of the market.) 
<PERSON>Mr. Stein</PERSON> said tighter operating controls have enabled <ORGANIZATION>Ekco</ORGANIZATION> to reduce inventory levels 25% to 30%; improve on-time delivery of orders to about 95% from around 70%; and to lower the number of labor hours required to produce a unit.
<ORGANIZATION>Ekco</ORGANIZATION>'s housewares operation makes kitchen tools and gadgets, as well as bakeware, at factories in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>.
The main issue in the strike at the <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> facility was health-care benefits, <PERSON>Mr. Stein</PERSON> said.
<ORGANIZATION>Ekco</ORGANIZATION> continues to seek further acquisitions in the consumer-products industry, <PERSON>Mr. Stein</PERSON> said.
The equity kicker is not attached to the offering, but underwriters said it will be offered after a filing for 68,548 common shares of <ORGANIZATION>CNW Holdings</ORGANIZATION> is declared effective by the <ORGANIZATION>Securities & Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>.

The legislation and other issues related to the stock market will be the focus of hearings this week by the <ORGANIZATION>House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Securities Subcommittee</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Richard Breeden</PERSON>, the new chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>, hasn't taken a formal position on the bill, which would also require investors to disclose large trades and give the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> additional authority during market emergencies.
In a July 6 letter to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Securities Subcommittee</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp.</ORGANIZATION> argued that the fact that no retail brokerage firm failed during the 1987 market crash demonstrates that current rules are adequate. 
<ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION>, whose holding company, <ORGANIZATION>CS First Boston Group</ORGANIZATION>, is one of the larger issuers of bridge loans on Wall Street, said it is also concerned that once the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> has the power to monitor holding companies, it will try to regulate their activities. 
"The proposal, while well-intended, I think can be dangerously misleading because the likely consequence would be to weaken, rather than strengthen the control the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> has exercised for 50 years over the financial adequacy and viability of broker-dealers," <PERSON>Michael Raoul-Duval</PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview. 
Sources in the industry and on <LOCATION>Capitol Hill</LOCATION> say a compromise that would placate the industry while addressing the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>'s concerns may be possible.
<PERSON>Edward O'Brien</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Securities Industry Association</ORGANIZATION>, said that the securities-industry trade group opposes the bill as it is written but that it is "hopeful a compromise can be reached to achieve the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>'s goals." 
<PERSON>Mr. O'Brien</PERSON> will elaborate on the <ORGANIZATION>SIA</ORGANIZATION>'s position in testimony before the <ORGANIZATION>House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee</ORGANIZATION> this week, a spokesman said. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Marina</ORGANIZATION> rescue center offered a very <LOCATION>San Franciscan</LOCATION> response to the disaster.
On lampposts along <ORGANIZATION>Fillmore Street</ORGANIZATION>, a major <LOCATION>Marina</LOCATION> artery, posters were offering a $100 reward for a cat lost during the quake. 
For example, one parakeet owner returning home found that her apartment, like many others in the <LOCATION>Marina</LOCATION>, didn't have heat. "She can stay there with no heat, but for a parakeet, that can be deadly," says <PERSON>Daralee Konowitch</PERSON>, animalcare services manager for the <ORGANIZATION>SPCA</ORGANIZATION>.
The <LOCATION>Bay Bridge</LOCATION>, the main artery into <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> from the east, will be closed for at least several weeks.
Most unusual will be water-borne commuters from the East Bay towns of <ORGANIZATION>Oakland</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>.
For the first time in 32 years, ferry service has been restored between the <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
The Red and <ORGANIZATION>White Fleet</ORGANIZATION>, which operates regular commuter ferry service to and from <LOCATION>Marin County</LOCATION>, and tourist tours of the bay, is offering <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION> commuters a chance to ride the waves for the price of $10 round-trip. 
Officials expect the <ORGANIZATION>Golden Gate Bridge</ORGANIZATION> to be swamped with an extra load of commuters, including <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION> residents making a long detour. "We're anticipating quite a traffic crunch," said one official.
It also raised hackles of the city's tourism boosters. "Other cities are calling {groups booked here for tours and conferences} and -- not to be crass -- stealing our booking list," said <PERSON>Scott Shafer</PERSON>, a spokesman for Mayor <PERSON>Art Agnos</PERSON>. 
The preliminary conclusion from a survey of 200 downtown high-rises is that "we were incredibly lucky," said <PERSON>Lawrence Kornfield</PERSON>, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s chief building inspector.
In <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Martin Leach</PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's of London</ORGANIZATION>, said the insurance market hasn't yet been able to estimate the total potential claims from the disaster. "The extent of the claims won't be known for some time," <PERSON>Mr. Leach</PERSON> said. 
On Friday, during a visit to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> to survey quake damage, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> promised to "meet the federal government's obligation" to assist relief efforts. 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> officials plan to ask <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> for $3 billion or more of federal aid, in the form of grants and low-interest loans.
<PERSON>G. Christian Hill</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ken Wells</PERSON> contributed to this article. 
The first signs of trouble came last month when the <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> carrier, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Swire Pacific Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, posted a 5% drop in operating profit for the first six months and warned that margins will remain under pressure for the rest of the year. 
Fuel and personnel costs are rising, and tourism in and through <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> remains clouded by <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s turmoil since the June 4 killings in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>. 
There also is concern that once <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> reverts to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s sovereignty in 1997, <ORGANIZATION>Cathay</ORGANIZATION> will be forced to play second fiddle to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s often-disparaged flag carrier, <ORGANIZATION>Civil Aviation Administration</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION>CAAC</ORGANIZATION>. 
"The sense is we would never be in a position again where everything works for us the way it did before," says <PERSON>Rod Eddington</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Cathay</ORGANIZATION>'s commercial director. 
<PERSON>Sarah Hall</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>James Capel</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>) <LOCATION>Ltd.</LOCATION>, says there isn't much Cathay can do about rising costs for jet fuel, <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s tight labor market, or the strengthening of the local currency, which is pegged to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollar.
In addition to aircraft from <ORGANIZATION>Boeing Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Cathay</ORGANIZATION> announced earlier this year an order for as many as 20 <ORGANIZATION>Airbus</ORGANIZATION> A330-300s.
The fuel-efficient Airbus planes will be used largely to replace Cathay's aging fleet of <ORGANIZATION>Lockheed Tristars</ORGANIZATION> for regional flights, while the <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> aircraft will be used on long-haul routes to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>. 
Some jobs already have been moved to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, and there are plans to place others in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>.
Although the June 4 killings in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> have hurt its <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> flights, <ORGANIZATION>Cathay</ORGANIZATION>'s other routes have retained high load factors.
<PERSON>Mr. Eddington</PERSON> regards promoting <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> as an important part of attracting visitors from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>, where the number of people looking to travel abroad has surged. 
There also has been speculation that <ORGANIZATION>Cathay</ORGANIZATION> will be among the major private-sector participants in the <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> government's plans to build a new airport, with the carrier possibly investing in its own terminal.
<PERSON>Mr. Eddington</PERSON> sees alliances with other carriers -- particularly <PERSON>Cathay</PERSON>'s recent link with <ORGANIZATION>AMR Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION> -- as an important part of <ORGANIZATION>Cathay</ORGANIZATION>'s strategy.
But he emphasizes that <ORGANIZATION>Cathay</ORGANIZATION> hasn't any interest in swapping equity stakes with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> carrier or with <ORGANIZATION>Lufthansa</ORGANIZATION>, the West German airline with which it has cooperated for about a decade.
In a pattern it aims to copy in several key <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> destinations, Cathay recently announced plans to serve <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> by flying into <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> hub and routing continuing passengers onto a flight on the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> carrier. 
"We'll never have a big operation in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, and they'll never have one as big as us in the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Mr. Eddington</PERSON> says. "But this way, <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> will coordinate good extensions to <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>.
We'll coordinate on this end to places like <LOCATION>Bangkok</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>." 
Cathay has long stated its desire to double its weekly flights into <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> to 14, and it is applying to restart long-canceled flights into <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>.
Further expansion into southern <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> is also possible, says <PERSON>Mr. Bell</PERSON>, the spokesman. 
While a large number of <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> companies have reincorporated offshore ahead of 1997, such a move isn't an option for <ORGANIZATION>Cathay</ORGANIZATION> because it would jeopardize its landing rights in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>.
And <PERSON>Mr. Eddington</PERSON> emphatically rules out a move to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>: "Our lifeblood is <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> traffic rights." 
He says the airline is putting its faith in the Sino-British agreement on <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s return to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>.
A special section dealing with aviation rights states that landing rights for <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s airlines, which include the smaller <ORGANIZATION>Hong Kong Dragon Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, will continue to be negotiated by <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s government.

With the dust settling from the failed coup attempt in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, one of the many lingering questions the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration will ponder is this: Is the <ORGANIZATION>National Security Council</ORGANIZATION> staff big enough, and does it have enough clout, to do its job of coordinating foreign policy? 
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Brent Scowcroft</PERSON>, came into office in January intent on making the <ORGANIZATION>NSC</ORGANIZATION> staff leaner and more disciplined than it had been during the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration.
Gen. <PERSON>Scowcroft</PERSON> was a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Tower Commission</ORGANIZATION>, which investigated the <LOCATION>Iran-Contra</LOCATION> affair.
He was all too aware of how a large, inadequately supervised <ORGANIZATION>NSC</ORGANIZATION> staff had spun out of control and nearly wrecked President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s second term. 
So, following both the style he pursued as President <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s national security adviser and the recommendations of the <ORGANIZATION>Tower Commission</ORGANIZATION>, Gen. <PERSON>Scowcroft</PERSON> has pruned the <ORGANIZATION>NSC</ORGANIZATION> staff and tried to ensure that it sticks to its assigned tasks -- namely, gathering the views of the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> and intelligence community; serving as an honest broker in distilling that information for the president and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Tower Commission</ORGANIZATION> specifically said that the <ORGANIZATION>NSC</ORGANIZATION> staff should be "small" and warned against letting "energetic self-starters" like Lt. Col. <PERSON>Oliver North</PERSON> strike out on their own rather than leaving the day-to-day execution of policies to the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>Central Intelligence Agency</ORGANIZATION>. 
However, the <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> episode has raised questions about whether the <ORGANIZATION>NSC</ORGANIZATION> staff is sufficiently big, diverse and powerful to coordinate <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> policy on tough issues.
The <ORGANIZATION>NSC</ORGANIZATION> staff "doesn't have the horsepower that I believe is required to have an effective interagency process," says <PERSON>Frank Gaffney</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> aide who now runs the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Security Policy</ORGANIZATION>, a conservative <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> think-tank. "The problem with this administration, I think, is that by design it has greatly diminished, both in a physical sense and in a procedural sense, the role of the <ORGANIZATION>NSC</ORGANIZATION>." 
The <ORGANIZATION>National Security Council</ORGANIZATION> itself was established in 1947 because policy makers sensed a need, in an increasingly complex world, for a formal system within the White House to make sure that communications flowed smoothly between the president and the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> and intelligence agencies.
In the <ORGANIZATION>Bush White House</ORGANIZATION>, the size of the <ORGANIZATION>NSC</ORGANIZATION>'s staff of professional officers is down to about 50 from about 70 in 1987, administration officials say. 
But one clear problem during the coup attempt was that the <ORGANIZATION>NSC</ORGANIZATION> staffer most experienced in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Everett Briggs</PERSON>, was gone.
He had just resigned, at least in part because of a feud with Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON>Bernard Aronson</PERSON> over the administration's policy on <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> and support for <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>'s Contra rebels. 
The absence of <PERSON>Mr. Briggs</PERSON> underscored the possible inadequacy of the current <ORGANIZATION>NSC</ORGANIZATION> staff.
Both Gen. <PERSON>Scowcroft</PERSON> and his deputy, <PERSON>Robert Gates</PERSON>, are experts in U.S.-Soviet affairs.
Gen. <PERSON>Scowcroft</PERSON> is particularly well-versed in arms control, and <PERSON>Mr. Gates</PERSON> has spent years studying Soviet politics and society.
But neither has an extensive background in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>.
Gen. <PERSON>Scowcroft</PERSON> knows as well as anyone that one of the biggest dangers he faces is that <ORGANIZATION>NSC</ORGANIZATION> staffers working in relative anonymity will take over policy-making and operational tasks that are best left to bigger and more experienced <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> bureaus.
But just as every previous <ORGANIZATION>NSC</ORGANIZATION> adviser has, Gen. <PERSON>Scowcroft</PERSON> now will have to mull at what point the <ORGANIZATION>NSC</ORGANIZATION> staff becomes too lean and too restrained. 
The investigation, which will be coordinated with one already under way in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, follows the discovery of what <PERSON>Ferranti</PERSON> has called a "serious" fraud involving its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> subsidiary. 
<ORGANIZATION>International Signal & Control</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Lancaster</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, a defense-equipment manufacturer, was bought by <PERSON>Ferranti</PERSON> in 1987 for #420 million ($670.3 million).
The <ORGANIZATION>Serious Fraud Office</ORGANIZATION>, a division of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Metropolitan Police</ORGANIZATION> responsible for investigating financial crimes, said its work would take in "allegations of fraud prior to, surrounding and subsequent to the merger." 
<PERSON>Ferranti</PERSON> said that it welcomes the investigation and that it will "cooperate fully." <PERSON>Derek Alun-Jones</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Ferranti</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, has said he hoped to pursue legal action against those responsible.

The <ORGANIZATION>Better Business Bureau of San Diego</ORGANIZATION> and the state Attorney General's office entered into a settlement stemming from an investigation of bureau-sponsored business directories published by an outside firm, <ORGANIZATION>Better Book Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
Industry executives said <ORGANIZATION>Interpublic</ORGANIZATION> approached <LOCATION>Saatchi</LOCATION> in August about buying its Campbell-Mithun-Esty unit, but was turned down by Chairman <PERSON>Maurice Saatchi</PERSON>.
More recently, <ORGANIZATION>Interpublic</ORGANIZATION> inquired about one of <LOCATION>Saatchi</LOCATION>'s smaller communications companies -- identified as the <LOCATION>Rowland</LOCATION> public relations firm by several industry executives -- but again was rebuffed, they said.
<ORGANIZATION>Interpublic</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, <PERSON>Philip Geier Jr.</PERSON>, made the pitches in visits to <PERSON>Mr. Saatchi</PERSON> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, the executives said. 
A <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi</ORGANIZATION> spokesman declined to comment about <ORGANIZATION>Interpublic</ORGANIZATION>.
But the spokesman confirmed that <PERSON>Saatchi</PERSON> has received several inquiries from companies interested in acquiring its Campbell-Mithun and <LOCATION>Rowland</LOCATION> units.
It named a new chief executive officer, former <ORGANIZATION>IMS International</ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON>Robert Louis-Dreyfus</PERSON>.
It rebuffed an offer by <PERSON>Carl Spielvogel</PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Backer Spielvogel Bates</ORGANIZATION> unit, to lead a management buy-out of all or part of <LOCATION>Saatchi</LOCATION>.
And last week, people close to <PERSON>Saatchi</PERSON> said <PERSON>Maurice Saatchi</PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON>Charles</PERSON>, would lead a buy-out if a hostile bid emerged. 
While <LOCATION>Saatchi</LOCATION>'s major agency networks -- <ORGANIZATION>Backer Spielvogel</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising</ORGANIZATION> -- would be difficult for any ad firm to buy because of potential client conflicts, its smaller businesses are quite attractive. 
Campbell-Mithun-Esty, for example, has had big problems at its <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> office, but offers strong offices in other areas of the country, including <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>.
That would would make it appealing to a network such as <ORGANIZATION>Interpublic</ORGANIZATION> that already has a healthy <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> presence. (While there would be some client conflicts, they wouldn't be nearly as onerous as with <LOCATION>Saatchi</LOCATION>'s other agencies.) Campbell-Mithun also would be a sizable addition to an agency network: It has billings of about $850 million and blue-chip clients including <ORGANIZATION>General Mills</ORGANIZATION>, Jeep/Eagle and <ORGANIZATION>Dow Brands</ORGANIZATION>. 
<LOCATION>Rowland</LOCATION>, meanwhile, has expanded aggressively, and now ranks as the fifth-largest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> public relations firm, according to <PERSON>O'Dwyer</PERSON>'s Directory of Public Relations Firms.
Other <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi</ORGANIZATION> units include ad agency <ORGANIZATION>McCaffrey & McCall</ORGANIZATION>, which has the <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes</ORGANIZATION> account and which has been attempting to buy itself back; and <PERSON>Howard Marlboro</PERSON>, a sports and event marketing firm. 
Despite <PERSON>Saatchi</PERSON>'s firm stand against selling its ad units, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> analysts believe the company may ultimately sell some of the smaller units.
In addition to <ORGANIZATION>Backer Spielvogel Bates</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Saatchi</LOCATION> unit that has handled the account since 1970, the other agencies include <PERSON>Lowe Marschalk</PERSON>, a unit of the <ORGANIZATION>Lowe Group</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Grey Advertising</ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION>WPP Group</ORGANIZATION>'s Scali, <ORGANIZATION>McCabe</ORGANIZATION>, Sloves agency.
A spokesman for the insurance and financial services firm, based in <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, said it hopes to make a decision within three to four months. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Jamaica Tourist Board</ORGANIZATION>, in the wake of <ORGANIZATION>Young & Rubicam</ORGANIZATION>'s indictment on charges that it bribed Jamaican officials to win the account in 1981, released a scathing memo blaming the agency for the embarrassing incident. 
Among other things, the memo contends that <ORGANIZATION>Young & Rubicam</ORGANIZATION> gave false assurances that the investigation wouldn't uncover any information that would "embarrass the government of <LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION> or the <ORGANIZATION>Jamaica Tourist Board</ORGANIZATION>." It also contends that <ORGANIZATION>Young & Rubicam</ORGANIZATION> never told the tourist board about its relationship with Ad Ventures, a Jamaican firm hired by the agency.
NEW ACCOUNT: <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Brea</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, awarded its estimated $10 million to $30 million account to Asher/Gould, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
Also participating in the finals was <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> agency <ORGANIZATION>Hakuhodo Advertising America</ORGANIZATION>.
American <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON>'s previous agency, <PERSON>Keye/Donna/Pearlstein</PERSON>, didn't participate. 
AYER TALKS: N W Ayer's president and chief executive officer, <PERSON>Jerry J. Siano</PERSON>, said the agency is holding "conversations" about acquiring <ORGANIZATION>Zwiren Collins Karo & Trusk</ORGANIZATION>, a midsized <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> agency, but a deal isn't yet close to being completed. 
WHO'S NEWS: <PERSON>John Wells</PERSON>, 47, former president and chief executive of N W Ayer's <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> office, was named management director and director of account services at <ORGANIZATION>WPP Group</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>J. Walter Thompson</PERSON> agency in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. . . . <PERSON>Shelly Lazarus</PERSON>, 42, was named president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy & Mather Direct</ORGANIZATION>, the direct mail division of <ORGANIZATION>WPP Group's Ogilvy & Mather</ORGANIZATION> agency. 
One company recently was listed on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, and another will join the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> from the over-the-counter market this week.

<ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris Cos.</ORGANIZATION>, whose <ORGANIZATION>Benson & Hedges</ORGANIZATION> cigarette brand has been losing market share, has asked at least one other agency to try its hand at creative work for the big account, which has been at <ORGANIZATION>Wells Rich Greene Inc.</ORGANIZATION> since 1966. 
Executives close to <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris</ORGANIZATION> said that the tobacco and food giant has asked <ORGANIZATION>Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi & Saatchi Co.</ORGANIZATION>, and possibly others to work on creative ideas for the account.
Several executives said another potential contender is <ORGANIZATION>WPP Group's Ogilvy & Mather</ORGANIZATION> agency, which works on some other <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris</ORGANIZATION> products.
Both <PERSON>Philip Morris</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Backer Spielvogel</ORGANIZATION> declined to comment.
According to <PERSON>John Maxwell</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Wheat First Securities</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Benson & Hedges</ORGANIZATION> has slipped from 4.7% of the cigarette market in 1985 to just 4.1% after the second quarter of this year.
<PERSON>Wells Rich</PERSON> first popularized the <ORGANIZATION>Benson & Hedges</ORGANIZATION> brand more than 20 years ago with ads portraying, among other things, an elevator door closing on a passenger's cigarette.
<PERSON>Philip Morris</PERSON>, trying to revive the <ORGANIZATION>Benson & Hedges</ORGANIZATION> franchise, put the account up for review in 1986.
<PERSON>Wells Rich Greene</PERSON>, however, in an effort directed by <PERSON>Mary Wells Lawrence</PERSON>, emerged the victor of the review and retained the business. 
<PERSON>Kenneth Olshan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Wells Rich</PERSON>'s chairman, didn't return phone calls seeking comment. 
While <PERSON>Wells Rich</PERSON> recently picked up <ORGANIZATION>Hertz Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's $25 million to $30 million account, it has lost a number of big accounts this year, including the $20 million to $25 million Cadbury-Schweppes Canada Dry and Sunkist accounts, the $18 million <ORGANIZATION>Procter & Gamble Co</ORGANIZATION>. Sure deodorant account and the $10 million Polo/Ralph Lauren business.
Its victories include more than $30 million in <ORGANIZATION>Sheraton Corp.</ORGANIZATION> business and an assignment from <ORGANIZATION>Dun & Bradstreet</ORGANIZATION> worth $5 million to $10 million. 
"Recent data have indicated somewhat weaker economic activity," said <PERSON>Elliott Platt</PERSON>, director of economic research at <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities</ORGANIZATION>.
For example, a group of long-term <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bonds tracked by <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION> produced a total return of 1% in the first quarter, 12.45% in the second quarter and -0.06% in the third quarter.
Add it all up and it means "that the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> has a little leeway to ease its credit policy stance without the risk of rekindling inflation," said <PERSON>Norman Robertson</PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION>Mellon Bank Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>. "I think we will see a federal funds rate of close to 8 1/2% in the next two weeks and 8% by year end." 
<PERSON>James Kochan</PERSON>, chief fixed-income strategist at <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION>, is touting shorter-term securities, which he says should benefit more quickly than longer-term bonds as interest rates fall. "Given our forecast for lower rates, purchases made now should prove quite rewarding before year end," he said. 
<PERSON>Mr. Kochan</PERSON> also likes long-term, investment-grade corporate bonds and long-term <ORGANIZATION>Treasurys</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Resolution Funding Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION>Refcorp</ORGANIZATION>, a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation's troubled savings and loan associations, will hold its first bond auction Wednesday, when it will sell $4.5 billion of 30-year bonds.
When the size of the <ORGANIZATION>Refcorp</ORGANIZATION> offering was announced last week and when-issued trading activity began, the bailout bonds were yielding about 1/20 percentage point more than the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year bond.
"The supply is not a constraint to the market," said <PERSON>Samuel Kahan</PERSON>, chief financial economist at <ORGANIZATION>Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "If one thinks that rates are going down, you don't care how much supply is coming." 
Today, for example, underwriters at <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley & Co.</ORGANIZATION> said they expect to price a $150 million, 12-year senior subordinated debenture offering by <ORGANIZATION>Imo Industries Inc</ORGANIZATION>. Traders expect the issue to be priced to yield 12%.
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said that a $150 million senior subordinated discount debenture issue by <ORGANIZATION>R.P. Scherer Drugs</ORGANIZATION> is expected by the end of the month. 
"There are about a dozen more deals coming," said <PERSON>Michael McNamara</PERSON>, director of fixed-income research at <ORGANIZATION>Kemper Financial Services Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "If they had this much trouble with <ORGANIZATION>Chicago & North Western</ORGANIZATION>, they are going to have an awful time with the rest." 
And pressure by big investors forced <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to sweeten <ORGANIZATION>Chicago & North Western</ORGANIZATION>'s $475 million junk bond offering.
"More than ever, people should realize they should have a diversified portfolio," said <PERSON>Jeremy Duffield</PERSON>, a senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Vanguard Group</ORGANIZATION>. "That means stocks, bonds, money market instruments and real estate." 
"You want to know how a fund did when the market got hammered," said <PERSON>Kurt Brouwer</PERSON>, an investment adviser with <ORGANIZATION>Brouwer & Janachowski</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. "It's like kicking the tires of a car . . . . What you want to know is when the road's rough, when there's snow and ice, how's this car going to perform?" 
"That's the problem with trying to hedge too much," said <PERSON>Mr. Brouwer</PERSON>. "You don't make any real money." Over the last 20 years, for example, <PERSON>Mr. Brouwer</PERSON> says, an investor putting $5,000 a year in the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 would have made nearly twice as much than if it were invested in <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bills. 
By the time the market plummeted 10 days ago, <ORGANIZATION>Monetta</ORGANIZATION> was 55% in cash, said <PERSON>Robert Bacarella</PERSON>, president and portfolio manager.
Last Monday, he started "buying the high-quality growth companies that people were throwing away at discount prices." Among <PERSON>Mr. Bacarella</PERSON>'s picks: <ORGANIZATION>Oracle Systems</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Reebok International Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Digital Microwave Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Howard Stein</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Dreyfus Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said the fund was about half invested in government bonds on Oct. 13, and about 10% in cash. "In a downward market, bonds act better," he said. "We still think there's a lot of unsettlement in this market.
Reflecting airline takeover activity, however, both the <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Select Air Transportation Portfolio</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>National Aviation & Technology</ORGANIZATION> fund posted better-than-average returns for the the year to date: 30.09% for the <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Air Transportation</ORGANIZATION> fund and a whopping 47.24% for <ORGANIZATION>National Aviation & Technology</ORGANIZATION>. 
The small drop in equity funds in general in the latest week may not necessarily be a good sign, said <PERSON>A. Michael Lipper</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Lipper Analytical</ORGANIZATION>.
"There certainly hasn't been a panic reaction," said <PERSON>Steven Norwitz</PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION>T. Rowe Price Associates</ORGANIZATION>. "People showed some staying power and, in fact, interest in buying equities."

(See: "Pro-Choice Power: <ORGANIZATION>Abortion Issue Erodes Conservative Loyalty</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey GOP</ORGANIZATION> --- The Right's Social Agenda Is a Liability as Republican Lags in Governer's Race --- Also Unpopular: Toxic Waste" -- WSJ Oct. 20, 1989) 
<PERSON>Makoto Utsumi</PERSON>, vice minister for international affairs, said the ministry didn't in any way suggest to Japanese banks that they stay out of the <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION> leveraged buy-out.
A number of accounts of the events leading to the 190 point drop in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> stock prices on Oct. 13 accused the ministry of pulling the plug on the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> deal for one reason or another. 
<PERSON>Mr. Utsumi</PERSON> said the most the ministry had ever done was ask Japanese banks about "the status of their participation" in one previous <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> leveraged buy-out.
The ministry inquired about that deal -- which <PERSON>Mr. Utsumi</PERSON> declined to identify -- because the large presence of Japanese banks in the deal was "being strongly criticized in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>" and it was "necessary for us to grasp the situation." He said the inquiry wasn't made in a way that the banks could have interpreted as either encouraging or discouraging participation, and he added that none of the Japanese banks changed their posture on the deal as a result of the inquiry. 
<PERSON>Mr. Utsumi</PERSON> also said some Japanese banks were willing to participate in the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> financing up to the very end, which would suggest at the very least that they weren't under orders to back out.
It's a sound phenomenon." <ORGANIZATION>Sanwa Bank Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> is one Japanese bank that decided not to participate in the first <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> proposal.
Despite <PERSON>Mr. Sumita</PERSON>'s statements, it is the <ORGANIZATION>Finance Ministry</ORGANIZATION>, not the central bank, that makes policy decisions. 
The neighborhood around <PERSON>Alexander Haagen Co.</PERSON> 's Vermont-Slauson Shopping Center in the Watts section of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> resembles the crime-ridden, deteriorating sections of many inner cities and certainly isn't the sort of area one would choose to visit.
<PERSON>Bradford Crowe</PERSON>, director of the mayor's <ORGANIZATION>City Economic Development Office</ORGANIZATION>, says: "There is no question that <PERSON>Vermont-Slauson</PERSON> had a halo effect on the surrounding neighborhood.
In the <ORGANIZATION>Grand Boulevard Plaza</ORGANIZATION> developed by <ORGANIZATION>Matanky Realty Group</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s Third Ward, opposite the <PERSON>Robert Taylor Homes</PERSON>, 29% of the stores to date have been leased to blacks and 14% to members of other minority groups.
These features are also used in <ORGANIZATION>Matanky Realty Group</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Grand Boulevard Plaza</LOCATION>.
These security costs are kept off-budget because the centers' site acquisition, construction, and financing costs were reduced by such programs as <ORGANIZATION>Urban Development Action Grants</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Economic Development Administration Grants</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Community Development Block Grants</ORGANIZATION>, tax-free Industrial Development Bonds, Enterprise Zone tax write-offs, city infrastructure grants, and tax increment financing.

<ORGANIZATION>Rochester Telephone Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it completed its purchase of <ORGANIZATION>Urban Telephone Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>Clintonville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION>, the second-largest unaffiliated independent telephone company in that state. 
<ORGANIZATION>Rochester Telephone</ORGANIZATION> said the acquisition was made in an exchange of its common shares for all the shares of <ORGANIZATION>Urban Telephone</ORGANIZATION>, but a price wasn't disclosed. 
Since June, <ORGANIZATION>Rochester Telephone</ORGANIZATION> signed letters of intent to purchase three other <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> firms. 
The <LOCATION>Tempe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, maker of underground fuel-storage systems said the most recent period was affected by customers' problems complying with recent <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION> regulations. 
The long-running scandal surrounding the 1982 collapse of <ORGANIZATION>Banco Ambrosiano</ORGANIZATION> was reignited by the arrest last week of <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> businessman <PERSON>Flavio Carboni</PERSON> on fraud charges. 
<LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> magistrates accuse <PERSON>Mr. Carboni</PERSON> and several other people of trying to extort 1.2 billion lire ($880,000) from the <LOCATION>Vatican</LOCATION> in return for documents contained in the briefcase of <PERSON>Roberto Calvi</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Ambrosiano</LOCATION> chairman found hanged under <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Blackfriar</ORGANIZATION>'s Bridge shortly before the bank's collapse. 
<ORGANIZATION>Banco Ambrosiano</ORGANIZATION>, which was <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s largest private-sector bank, collapsed in 1982 with $1.3 billion of debts.
Most of the money was lent to a series of shell companies in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION> that were owned, directly or indirectly, by the <LOCATION>Vatican</LOCATION> bank.
The <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION>, which denies any wrongdoing, paid $250 million to the <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION> bank's creditors as a "goodwill gesture" in 1985. 
Italian news reports said <PERSON>Mr. Carboni</PERSON> and a colleague obtained 1.2 billion lire in checks from a <LOCATION>Vatican</LOCATION> official, <PERSON>Pavel Hnilica</PERSON>.
Italian papers speculated the briefcase contained papers either exonerating the <LOCATION>Vatican</LOCATION> bank from blame in the scandal, or showing that the bank, known as the Istituto per le Opere di Religione, channeled funds to <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> bloc groups such as Solidarity in <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>. 
Neither <PERSON>Mr. Hnilica</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Carboni</PERSON> nor <LOCATION>Vatican</LOCATION> officials could be reached for comment over the weekend. 
A former <ORGANIZATION>Sperry Corp.</ORGANIZATION> marketing executive, admitting his role in the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> procurement scandal, pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy charges for helping funnel $400,000 to a midlevel <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> acquisition official during the early 1980s. 
<PERSON>Frank Lavelle</PERSON>, who at the time was the marketing director for <PERSON>Sperry</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Clearwater</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, admitted participating in a scheme to bribe <PERSON>Garland Tomlin</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> official.
<PERSON>Mr. Tomlin</PERSON>, who left the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> in 1985, pleaded guilty earlier this year to related conspiracy, bribery and tax-evasion charges. 
The bribery scheme took place between 1982 and 1985, according to documents filed by prosecutors in connection with <PERSON>Mr. Lavelle</PERSON>'s guilty plea in federal district court in <LOCATION>Alexandria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Sperry</PERSON> merged with <ORGANIZATION>Burroughs Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to become <ORGANIZATION>Unisys Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in late 1986. 
Court documents filed by prosecutors indicate <PERSON>Mr. Tomlin</PERSON> tried to steer to <PERSON>Sperry</PERSON> a multimillion dollar contract to computerize maintenance of certain <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> electronics equiment.
<PERSON>Mr. Tomlin</PERSON>, among other things, illegally provided <PERSON>Mr. Lavelle</PERSON> with inside information and documents intended to give <PERSON>Sperry</PERSON> an unfair advantage in the competition, the documents said.
Documents filed by prosecutors also indicate that <PERSON>Mr. Lavelle</PERSON> and his fellow conspirators requested and obtained "approval of the scheme" from more-senior <PERSON>Sperry</PERSON> officials "because the payment which {<PERSON>Mr.</PERSON>} <PERSON>Tomlin</PERSON> requested was so large." <PERSON>Charles Gardner</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>Unisys</ORGANIZATION> vice president, and <PERSON>James Neal</PERSON>, a former company consultant, have admitted participating in this and other bribery schemes.
"I think it is a good theme for what looks to be an uncertain market," says <PERSON>Steven Einhorn</PERSON>, partner at <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs</ORGANIZATION>. 
Growth stocks may be as big as <PERSON>Philip Morris</PERSON> or medium-sized such as <ORGANIZATION>Circuit City Stores</ORGANIZATION>, but their common characteristic is a history of increasing profits on the order of at least 15% to 20% a year, money managers say. 
"The period when growth stocks should be performing well is when their earnings are growing at a superior rate to the general level of corporate profits," says <PERSON>Stephen Boesel</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>T. Rowe Price's Growth</ORGANIZATION> and Income Fund. 
This kind of jumpy uncertainty reminds <PERSON>John Calverley</PERSON>, senior economist for <ORGANIZATION>American Express Bank</ORGANIZATION>, of the 1969-72 period, when the industrial average rolled through huge ranges and investors flocked to the shares of companies with proven earnings records, which became known as the "nifty 50." 
<PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON> recommends <ORGANIZATION>Cypress Semiconductor</ORGANIZATION> that is currently showing a robust 63% earnings growth rate. 
<PERSON>Ronald Sloan</PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Siebel Capital Management</ORGANIZATION>, likes <ORGANIZATION>Wellman Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a company that recycles plastic into synthetic fibers for carpeting.
<PERSON>Carmine Grigoli</PERSON>, chief market strategist for <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION>, who still says, "We expect the Dow average {to be at} 3000 by mid-1990," nonetheless foresees a sluggish economy in the meantime.
He recommends such blue-chip growth stalwarts as <PERSON>Philip Morris</PERSON>, PepsiCo, <ORGANIZATION>CPC International</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Reebok International</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Limited Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
Some money managers are pursuing growth stocks at the expense of those that rise and fall along with the economic cycle. "One of the stories of the fourth quarter is that we will get an unusual number of earnings disappointments from companies sensitive to the economy," says <PERSON>Mr. Boesel</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>T. Rowe Price</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>James Wright</PERSON>, chief investment officer for <ORGANIZATION>Banc One Asset Management</ORGANIZATION>, says, "We've been selling a disproportionate share of cyclical companies and buying a disproportionate share of high earnings stocks." He recently trimmed his portfolio of <ORGANIZATION>International Paper</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Dow Chemical</ORGANIZATION>, Quantum Chemical, <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines and Digital Equipment</ORGANIZATION>.
He is putting money in <ORGANIZATION>Dress Barn</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Circuit City Stores</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Bruno</PERSON>'s, and Rubbermaid. 
<ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Einhorn</PERSON>, for one, subscribes to that scenario.
The <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 rose 4%, the Dow Jones Equity Market index gained 3.7% and the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite index added 3.5%. 
The latest drop followed a decision by <ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION>, which had supported the $300-a-share buy-out offer for <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> from a labor-management group, not to participate in any revised bid.
While most other airline issues took their cue from <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>USAir Group</ORGANIZATION> rose 1 3/4 to 43 1/4 on 1.5 million shares amid speculation about a possible takeover proposal from investor <PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON>.
<ORGANIZATION>USA Today</ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON>, who had pursued <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> before dropping his bid Wednesday, has acquired a stake of about 3% in <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION>.
Paper and forest-products stocks declined after <ORGANIZATION>Smith Barney</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Harris Upham & Co.</ORGANIZATION> lowered investment ratings on a number of issues in the two sectors, based on a forecast that pulp prices will fall sharply.
International Paper dropped 5/8 to 51, <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> fell 1 3/4 to 56 1/4, <ORGANIZATION>Stone Container</ORGANIZATION> tumbled 1 1/2 to 26 5/8, <ORGANIZATION>Great Northern Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION> went down 5/8 to 38 3/8 and <ORGANIZATION>Weyerhaeuser</ORGANIZATION> lost 7/8 to 28 1/8. 
A group including <ORGANIZATION>ESL Partners Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Fort Worth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, investment partnership, and <PERSON>Richard E. Rainwater</PERSON>, a former adviser to the <LOCATION>Fort Worth Bass</LOCATION> family, said it reduced its stake in <ORGANIZATION>Anacomp Inc.</ORGANIZATION> to 3.6% of the common shares outstanding. 
<ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> received a $30.6 million <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> contract for MX-missile nose cones. 
<ORGANIZATION>Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.</ORGANIZATION> was awarded a $19.1 million <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> contract for armored-vehicle parts. 
<ORGANIZATION>Analytic Sciences Corp.</ORGANIZATION> was awarded a $10.1 million <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> contract for technical support. 
<ORGANIZATION>MCI COMMUNICATIONS Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it filed a shelf registration with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> for issuance of as much as $750 million of debt securities.
The debt will include medium-term notes sold through <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
The funds will be used for refinancing existing debt of the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, concern at lower interest rates and for other general purposes.
This business trust company said its board elected <PERSON>Kieran E. Burke</PERSON>, a consultant to <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, as chief executive officer, a new post, and as president.
<PERSON>Mr. Burke</PERSON> succeeds <PERSON>Richard D. Manley</PERSON>, who will remain as a consultant to the company.
Chairman <PERSON>Jamie Whitten</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Miss.</LOCATION>) of the <ORGANIZATION>House Appropriations Committee</ORGANIZATION> proposed a $2.85 billion emergency funding package to assist <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s recovery from last week's earthquake and extend further aid to <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> victims of Hurricane Hugo. 
The panel is expected to add provisions waiving restrictions on the use of federal highway funds and may also shift money within the package to bolster the share for the <ORGANIZATION>Small Business Administration</ORGANIZATION>. "We will support it, we will thank him, and we will augment it where appropriate," said Rep. <PERSON>Vic Fazio</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>). 
Dubbed the "Dire Emergency Supplemental to Meet the <ORGANIZATION>Needs of Natural Disasters of National Significance</ORGANIZATION>," the measure is vintage <LOCATION>Whitten</LOCATION> in asserting federal responsibility and in disdaining budget impediments. "Such other amounts will be made available subsequently as required," the legislation reads, and the new obligations "shall not be a charge against the Budget Act, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, or other ceilings." 
<ORGANIZATION>Morgan</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Toronto-Dominion</ORGANIZATION> and Provident are leading that syndicate. 
The offer is in limbo, however, because <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> has agreed to merge its cellular-phone businesses with <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
It quoted <PERSON>Liu Changyi</PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION>Beijing Public Security Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, as saying that there were many more people involved in prostitution now than in 1985, when there were about 100 cases. 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> agreed to enforce a decision by an international wildlife conference to ban all trade in ivory, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of International Trade and Industry</ORGANIZATION> said.
Earlier, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> had said it might file a reservation against the ivory ban decided by ballot at the 103-nation <ORGANIZATION>United Nations Conference on International Trade</ORGANIZATION> in Endangered Species in <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> last week.
<LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> should close the <ORGANIZATION>Leaning Tower of Pisa</ORGANIZATION> because it's a danger to tourists, government-appointed experts said. "In some places the stonework is so damaged it shows signs of breaking off," scientists and technicians said in a report to Public Works Minister <PERSON>Giovanni Prandini</PERSON>.
Trade and Supply Minister <PERSON>Gerhard Briksa</PERSON> said in a letter published in the youth daily <ORGANIZATION>Junge Welt</ORGANIZATION> that the rise in alcohol consumption in <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> had been halted; but to reduce it further, he said, production and supply of other beverages, including fruit juices, should be stepped up.
<LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> has built a detention center for illegal immigrants from <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> because <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has refused for the past two weeks to accept them back.
The center, close to <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, will be ready today and will be able to house 1,000 inmates, Police Deputy Director <PERSON>Peter Wong</PERSON> said.
The dispute started when <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, angry that <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> had allowed dissident swimmer <PERSON>Yang Yang</PERSON> to flee to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, halted the usual daily transfer of illegal immigrants caught in this British colony, which reverts to <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>'s control in 1997. 
One <ORGANIZATION>Conservative MP</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>David Wilshire</PERSON>, said: "I should have a wonderful suntan by Christmas." Debates are due to be broadcast nationally starting Nov. 21 in a six-month experiment. 
A majority of Japanese banks are said to be wary of making new loans to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> under the <PERSON>Brady</PERSON> plan because they're uncertain the <LOCATION>Mexican</LOCATION> economy will remain stable. 
The plan, proposed by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON>Nicholas Brady</PERSON>, calls for banks either to make new loans or to reduce the principle on existing loans or to cut the interest rate on those existing loans. 
A poll in male-dominated <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> put <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON> first on a list of most-respected foreign leaders.
The <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> prime minister was the only woman singled out by respondents, who put Soviet President <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON> in second place. . . . The Soviet newspaper <ORGANIZATION>Trud</ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON>Mickey Mouse</PERSON> will appear in a Russian-language comic book to be issued four times a year by Soviet publisher <ORGANIZATION>Fizkultura</ORGANIZATION> i <ORGANIZATION>Sport</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Gutenberghus Group</ORGANIZATION>.
Sitting at the bar of the <ORGANIZATION>Four Seasons</ORGANIZATION> restaurant, architect <PERSON>William McDonough</PERSON> seems oblivious to the glamorous clientele and the elegant setting.
He has put some of his aesthetic ideas into practice with his design of the four-star <ORGANIZATION>Quilted Giraffe</ORGANIZATION> restaurant -- "architecturally impeccable," Progressive Architecture magazine called it -- and his remodeling of <PERSON>Paul Stuart</PERSON>, the Madison Avenue clothing store.
<PERSON>Mr. McDonough</PERSON> is about to tackle his biggest clean-air challenge yet, the proposed <ORGANIZATION>Warsaw Trade Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, the first such center in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>. 
If <PERSON>Mr. McDonough</PERSON>'s plans get executed, as much of the Polish center as possible will be made from aluminum, steel and glass recycled from <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION>'s abundant rubble.
The news hasn't exactly moved others in <PERSON>Mr. McDonough</PERSON>'s profession to become architectural <PERSON>Johnny Appleseeds</PERSON>.
All architects want to be aware of the ecological consequences of their work, says <PERSON>John Burgee</PERSON>, whose <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> firm is designing the redevelopment of Times Square, "but we can't all carry it to that extreme." <PERSON>Karen Nichols</PERSON>, senior associate at <ORGANIZATION>Michael Graves</ORGANIZATION>'s architecture firm in <LOCATION>Princeton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, says: "We're really at the mercy of what the construction industry can and will do readily." 
The son of a <ORGANIZATION>Seagram</ORGANIZATION>'s executive who was stationed in many countries around the world, <PERSON>Mr. McDonough</PERSON> was born in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> and attended 19 schools in places ranging from <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> to Shaker Heights, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, before entering <ORGANIZATION>Dartmouth College</ORGANIZATION>.
He and a <LOCATION>Dartmouth</LOCATION> roommate established a company that restored three hydroelectric power plants in <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>.
At <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>, he designed one of the first solarheated houses to be built in <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. McDonough</PERSON>'s first professional project fully to reflect his environmental ardor was his 1986 design for the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Defense Fund</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
The budget was only $400,000. "<LOCATION>Athens</LOCATION> with <LOCATION>Spartan</LOCATION> means," <PERSON>Mr. McDonough</PERSON> says.
Neither the Quilted Giraffe nor the <PERSON>Paul Stuart</PERSON> renovation reflects much of <PERSON>Mr. McDonough</PERSON>'s environmental concern.
To more than replace the wood from two English oaks used for paneling at <PERSON>Paul Stuart</PERSON>, however, <PERSON>Mr. McDonough</PERSON> and friends planted 1,000 acorns around the country. 
The center will provide space for computer hardware and facsimile and other telecommunications equipment, not readily accessible in <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> now, for a growing number of Westerners doing business in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. McDonough</PERSON> thinks of the center as the "Eiffel Tower of <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION>" and "a symbol of the resurgence of <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>." If any nation can use environmentally benign architecture, it is <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Jessica Mathews</PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION>World Resources Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, says that perhaps a quarter of <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>'s soil is too contaminated for safe farming because of air pollution.
<PERSON>Mr. Muniak</PERSON>'s company, <ORGANIZATION>Balag Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, has agreed to set aside the money to plant and maintain it, but discussions are still going on over where to place it and how to ensure that it will be maintained.
After all, <PERSON>Mr. Muniak</PERSON> says, "in <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> there aren't too many people worried about the environment.
In <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>, one out of four commercial firms is burglarized each year.
Two decades ago, the <ORGANIZATION>Small Business Administration</ORGANIZATION> reported <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> Prof.
<PERSON>Albert Reiss</PERSON>'s landmark study of crime against 2,500 small businesses drawn from national <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> records.
These findings illustrate the vicious cycle that <ORGANIZATION>National Institute of Justice</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>James K. Stewart</PERSON> calls "crime causing poverty." Underclass neighborhoods offer relatively few employment opportunities, contributing to the poverty of local residents.
With <ORGANIZATION>National Institute of Justice</ORGANIZATION> support, the <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION> police and the <ORGANIZATION>Crime Control Institute</ORGANIZATION> are currently testing the effects of such a strategy, comparing its deterrence value with traditional random patrols. 
<PERSON>Mr. Sherman</PERSON> is a professor of criminology at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Maryland</ORGANIZATION> and president of the <ORGANIZATION>Crime Control Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> 
Much of <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's losses stemmed from one-time write-downs of the value of some of <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's assets and those of its units.
The results included a A$453.4 million write-off of future income-tax benefits and a provision for a loss of A$149.5 million on the sale of a stake of about 20% in <LOCATION>Lonrho PLC</LOCATION>. However, <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said the tax benefits remain available and might be used later. 
The company said the general financial performance of its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> brewing operations, <ORGANIZATION>G. Heileman Brewing Co.</ORGANIZATION>, was "disappointing, and this has been reflected in the results." 
The staggering losses cap a tumultuous year for <PERSON>Alan Bond</PERSON> and his flagship, <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Only a year ago, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, who controls about 58% of the company, appeared to be building a war chest to attack some big companies.
This letter was inspired by <PERSON>David Asman</PERSON>'s Sept. 25 editorial-page article about <PERSON>Fidel Castro</PERSON>, "Man in the Middle of Drug Trafficking." 
I've organized a series of exchanges, exhibitions and other continuing projects between <LOCATION>Cuban</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> artists.
In any matters between us and the Cubans there can be no simplicity, consequently I've become familiar not only with <LOCATION>Cuban</LOCATION> art and artists, but also with <LOCATION>Cuban</LOCATION> bureaucrats and their counterparts in our own government.
The <LOCATION>Ochoa</LOCATION> trial in July, with its revelations of deeply rooted and widespread corruption, and the summary trial and execution, was extremely disturbing to everyone who has ever considered himself a friend of <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Asman</PERSON> should make distinctions among <PERSON>Fidel</PERSON>, the army and the <LOCATION>Cuban</LOCATION> people.
<PERSON>Mr. Asman</PERSON> is also annoyed that <PERSON>Mr. Castro</PERSON> has resisted collaboration with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials, even though by his own account that collaboration has been devised essentially as a mechanism for acts directly hostile to the <LOCATION>Cuban</LOCATION> regime, such as facilitating defections.
I think it's a little disingenuous to be surprised that <PERSON>Fidel</PERSON> doesn't invite the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. State Department</ORGANIZATION> to violate the jurisdiction of the <LOCATION>Cuban</LOCATION> government over its own territory. 
<ORGANIZATION>CRI Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it reduced the estimated cash distribution for its <ORGANIZATION>Capital Housing and Mortgage Partners Inc.</ORGANIZATION> trust to between 71 cents and 74 cents a share, from between 75 cents and 80 cents, for the year ending June 9, 1990. 
The change in expected cash distributions from the Champs real estate investment trust stems from a revised estimate of administrative costs, said <PERSON>Jay R. Cohen</PERSON>, <PERSON>Champs</PERSON> executive vice president. 
Ducks are this season's word for new taxes, under <ORGANIZATION>OMB</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>Richard Darman</PERSON>'s formulation that "if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck." <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> is quite clear: No new ducks. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Bush White House</ORGANIZATION> is breeding non-duck ducks the same way the <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> White House did: It hops on an issue that is unopposable -- cleaner air, better treatment of the disabled, better child care.
The bill also imposes the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> auto-emissions standards on all cars nationwide, as if a car registered in Big Sky, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, needed to be as clean as one driven in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
All this was recognized and documented in the succeeding years by economists, some of whom worked in the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration to lift this burden from the <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> people, states and local governments. 
In fact, during last year's campaign, the entire nation constantly heard <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> tout his accomplishments as head of the <ORGANIZATION>Task Force</ORGANIZATION> on Regulatory Relief. 
Officials declined to disclose the value of the transaction or the exact stake that <ORGANIZATION>GRE</ORGANIZATION> will hold in <LOCATION>Nationwide Anglia</LOCATION> Estate Agents.
But the companies said that <ORGANIZATION>Nationwide Anglia Estate Agents</ORGANIZATION> will market <ORGANIZATION>GRE</ORGANIZATION> life insurance, pension and investment products through its more than 1,000 retail outlets in the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> 
Besides the marketing agreement, <ORGANIZATION>GRE</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Nationwide Anglia</PERSON> has agreed to develop life insurance products with the composite insurer. 
On July 2, 1987, the tanker <ORGANIZATION>S.S. Glacier Bay</ORGANIZATION> struck a rock and spilled almost 150,000 gallons of oil into the <LOCATION>Cook Inlet</LOCATION>.
Defendants include <ORGANIZATION>British Petroleum America</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Trinidad Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the shipper; and the pipeline liability fund. 
The Oil Pollution Act, scheduled to come up for a vote in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> this fall, would provide that if claimants aren't paid within 90 days of a spill, the liability fund would compensate them and seek reimbursement from the owner or operator of the vessel, says a spokesman for Rep. <PERSON>George Miller</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>), a sponsor of the bill.
Bar associations and consultants are offering more programs to teach associates all they need to know about law but didn't learn in law school. "Law school teaches wonderful theory, but it doesn't teach the nuts and bolts of practical lawyering," says <PERSON>Aaron Weitz</PERSON>, head of a <ORGANIZATION>New York County Lawyers' Association</ORGANIZATION> committee that sponsors such a course. 
But these days, large firms hire as many as 30 new associates a year, and it's impossible to personally train everyone, says <PERSON>Joel Henning</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Hildebrandt Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a consulting firm that runs training classes. 
At the <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> firm of <ORGANIZATION>Weinberg & Green</ORGANIZATION>, new corporate and banking associates are required to enroll in a 20-class course.
The building, which will handle child abuse, custody and foster care cases, will be "less formal, less threatening and just basically less grim than most courthouses," says <PERSON>Edmund Edelman</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors</ORGANIZATION>. 
Cases in <LOCATION>Los Angeles County</LOCATION> involving dependent children are usually heard in the Criminal Courts Building. "We need to get the kids away from the criminals into a less traumatic environment," says <PERSON>Mr. Edelman</PERSON>.
About 45,000 children in <LOCATION>Los Angeles County</LOCATION> are under court supervision, <PERSON>Mr. Edelman</PERSON> says, and an average of 1,500 new children are added each month. 
That's the conclusion of a recent study of large law firms conducted by <ORGANIZATION>Altman & Weil Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION>Ardmore</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, law firm consultant.
"Bond investors have been watching stocks closely," said <PERSON>Joel Marver</PERSON>, chief fixed-income analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Technical Data Global Markets Group</ORGANIZATION>. "When you get a big sell-off in equities, money starts to shift into bonds," which are considered safer, he said. 
In more evidence of the growing division between "good" and "bad" junk bonds, a $150 million issue by <ORGANIZATION>Imo Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> was snapped up by investors while underwriters for <ORGANIZATION>Beatrice Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's $350 million issue are considering restructuring the deal to attract buyers. 
"On the negative side, the market will be affected by constant supply in all sectors of the market," said <PERSON>William M. Brachfeld</PERSON>, economist at <ORGANIZATION>Daiwa Securities America Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "On the other hand, we have economic news that is {expected to be} relatively positive for the bond market.
The only asset-backed deal larger than <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s was a $4 billion offering by <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Acceptance Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in 1986. 
<PERSON>Peter Karches</PERSON>, managing director at underwriter <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, said the issue was oversubscribed. "It's a segmented market, and if you have a good, strong credit, people have an appetite for it," he said.
<ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley</ORGANIZATION> is expected to price another junk bond deal, $350 million of senior subordinated debentures by <ORGANIZATION>Continental Cablevision Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, next Tuesday. 
In the case of <ORGANIZATION>Beatrice</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc.</ORGANIZATION> is considering restructuring the reset mechanism on the $200 million portion of the offering.
The <ORGANIZATION>Federal National Mortgage Association</ORGANIZATION> offered $1.2 billion of Remic securities in three issues, and the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.</ORGANIZATION> offered a $250 million Remic backed by 9% 15-year securities. 
<ORGANIZATION>Government National Mortgage Association</ORGANIZATION> 9% securities for November delivery were quoted late yesterday at 98 10/32, up 10/32; and <ORGANIZATION>Freddie Mac</ORGANIZATION> 9% securities were at 97 1/2, up 1/4.
The <ORGANIZATION>Ginnie Mae</ORGANIZATION> 9% issue was yielding 8.36% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> 10-year note widened slightly to 1.46 percentage points. 
A $575 million <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, electric and gas system revenue bond issue dominated the new issue sector. 
An official with lead underwriter <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION> said orders for the <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION> bonds were "on the slow side." He attributed that to the issue's aggressive pricing and large size, as well as the general lethargy in the municipal marketplace. 
Bricktop, another <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> black woman who found a measure of fame in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, said: "I don't think I've ever known anyone with a less complicated view of life, or whose life was more complicated than <PERSON>Josephine</PERSON>'s." 
She adopted 12 of assorted races, naming them the <PERSON>Rainbow Tribe</PERSON>, and driving her husband first to despair and then to <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>. 
Finally, <PERSON>Prince Rainier</PERSON> and Princess Grace saved her with the offer of a house in <LOCATION>Monaco</LOCATION>. 
Another lifelong complication, as <PERSON>Phyllis Rose</PERSON> makes clear in "Jazz Cleopatra: <PERSON>Josephine Baker</PERSON> in Her Time" (<ORGANIZATION>Doubleday</ORGANIZATION>, 321 pages, $22.50), was racism.
<PERSON>Baker</PERSON> had the good luck to arrive in 1925 <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, where blacks had become exotic.
<PERSON>Baker</PERSON> had bitter experience of bigotry from her <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> childhood and her days in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> theater, where she was judged too dark for an all-black chorus line (performing of course for all-white audiences). 
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> loved her at first sight. "She just wiggled her fanny and all the French fell in love with her," sniffed the literary world's <PERSON>Maria Jolas</PERSON>, not entirely inaccurately. "One can hardly overemphasize the importance of her rear end," <PERSON>Ms. Rose</PERSON> writes.
<PERSON>Ms. Rose</PERSON>, who teaches literature at <ORGANIZATION>Wesleyan University</ORGANIZATION>, quickly proceeds to overemphasize, claiming that <PERSON>Baker</PERSON>'s dancing "had uncovered a new region for desire" and thereby ignoring centuries of tributes to the callipygous. 
It is easy to see why <PERSON>Baker</PERSON>, a free spirit who broke many of the restraints convention places on women, attracts <PERSON>Ms. Rose</PERSON>, the author of "Parallel Lives," a wonderful study of Victorian marriage. 
<PERSON>Baker</PERSON> was 68 years old when she died in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, two days after the sold-out opening of her newest show: a movie-like ending to what was a cinematic life.
In fact, <PERSON>Ms. Baker</PERSON> played scenes in <LOCATION>Casablanca</LOCATION> that could have made it into "<LOCATION>Casablanca</LOCATION>." 
She was devoted to <PERSON>Charles de Gaulle</PERSON>'s cause, accepting great financial sacrifice and considerable risk to become first a spy and then a one-woman <ORGANIZATION>USO</ORGANIZATION> tour for the forces of <LOCATION>Free France</LOCATION>. 
In <PERSON>Humphrey Bogart</PERSON>'s nightclub, <PERSON>Victor Laszlo</PERSON> leads Free French sympathizers in "La Marseillaise" to drown out the Nazis.
The night the Germans occupied all of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> performed in <LOCATION>Casablanca</LOCATION>.
In her introduction, <PERSON>Ms. Rose</PERSON> writes that she feels she has much in common with <PERSON>Baker</PERSON>, but as "Jazz Cleopatra" goes on, it seems more rushed, as though the author were growing less interested.
Elsewhere, in an attempt to explain without stating it plainly that <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> had a large gay following later in her career when she was an overdressed singer rather than underdressed dancer, <PERSON>Ms. Rose</PERSON> writes: "She was a female impersonator who happened to be a woman." 
One devoted fan who fell under <PERSON>Baker</PERSON>'s spell in 1963 and began collecting <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> memorabilia was <PERSON>Bryan Hammond</PERSON>.
In "Josephine Baker" (<PERSON>Jonathan Cape</PERSON>, 304 pages, $35), which was published in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> last year and distributed in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> this month, <PERSON>Mr. Hammond</PERSON> has used his collection to produce an album of photographs and drawings of the star.
The text by <PERSON>Patrick O'Connor</PERSON> is a tough read, but the pictures make her magnetism clear and help explain why <PERSON>Ernest Hemingway</PERSON> called <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> "The most sensational woman anybody ever saw.
<ORGANIZATION>Moody's</ORGANIZATION> also said it raised its rating on the <ORGANIZATION>Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank</ORGANIZATION>, now known as <ORGANIZATION>Bank One</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Texas N.A.</LOCATION>, reflecting the support of other banking affiliates and substantial assistance for the <ORGANIZATION>FDIC</ORGANIZATION>. Officials at the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> bank-holding company weren't available for comment on the debt-rating changes. 
<LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> -- $575 million of electric and gas system revenue refunding bonds, Series 1989, 1989A and 1989B, tentatively priced by a <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp.</ORGANIZATION> group to yield from 6.15% in 1991 to 7.30% in 2009.
The bonds are rated double-A by <ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor's Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
<LOCATION>Maryland Stadium Authority</LOCATION> -- $137.6 million of sports facilities lease revenue bonds, Series 1989 D, due 1992-1999, 2004, 2009 and 2019, tentatively priced at par by a <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley</ORGANIZATION> group to yield from 6.35% in 1992 to 7.60% in 2019.
The bonds are rated double-A by <ORGANIZATION>Moody's</ORGANIZATION> and double-A-minus by <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.</ORGANIZATION> -- $250 million of Remic mortgage securities being offered in 11 classes by <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley</ORGANIZATION>.
The offering, Series 107, is backed by <ORGANIZATION>Freddie Mac</ORGANIZATION> 15-year, 9% securities, and brings <ORGANIZATION>Freddie Mac</ORGANIZATION>'s 1989 Remic issuance to $32.8 billion and its total volume to $46.8 billion since the program began in February 1988.
<ORGANIZATION>Federal National Mortgage Association</ORGANIZATION> -- $500 million of Remic mortgage securities being offered in 10 classes by <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ORGANIZATION>.
Separately, a $400 million issue of <ORGANIZATION>Fannie Mae Remic</ORGANIZATION> mortgage securities is being offered in 15 classes by <ORGANIZATION>Bear, Stearns & Co</ORGANIZATION>.
Finally, a $300 million issue of <ORGANIZATION>Fannie Mae Remic</ORGANIZATION> mortgage securities is being offered in 12 classes by <ORGANIZATION>Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co</ORGANIZATION>.
The three offerings together bring <ORGANIZATION>Fannie Mae</ORGANIZATION>'s 1989 Remic issuance to $32.4 billion and its total <ORGANIZATION>Remic</ORGANIZATION> volume to $44.5 billion since the program began in April 1987. 
Credit Agricole (<ORGANIZATION>CNCA</ORGANIZATION>) (French) -- $250 million of 8 3/4% bonds due Nov. 21, 1994, priced at 101.80 to yield 8.77% annually less full fees, via <ORGANIZATION>IBJ International Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. Fees 1 7/8. 
<ORGANIZATION>Hokuriku Electric Power Co.</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>) -- $200 million of 8 7/8% bonds due Nov. 20, 1996, priced at 101 3/4 to yield 8.90% less full fees, via <ORGANIZATION>Yamaichi International</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>) <LOCATION>Ltd</LOCATION>. Fees 1 7/8. 
<ORGANIZATION>International Finance Corp.</ORGANIZATION> (agency) -- 10 billion pesetas of 11.6% bonds due Nov. 30, 1994, priced at 101 5/8 to yield 11.60% less full fees, via <ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION>) and <ORGANIZATION>Banco Espanol de Credito</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Royal Bank of Canada</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Grand Cayman</LOCATION> branch (<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>) -- 100 million Canadian dollars of 10 3/4% deposit notes due Nov. 30, 1994, priced at 101 3/4 to yield 10.78% less full fees, via <ORGANIZATION>RBC Dominion Securities International Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. Fees 1 7/8. 
<ORGANIZATION>Union Bank of Finland</ORGANIZATION> -- 100 million Australian dollars of 9% bonds due Nov. 9, 1990, priced at 94 to yield 17.20% less full fees, via <ORGANIZATION>Banque Paribas Capital Markets Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. Fees 1.
<ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Credit</ORGANIZATION> -- $2.57 billion of certificates backed by automobile loans with a coupon rate of 8.70%, priced at 99 19/32 to yield 8.903% through an underwriting group headed by <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
The issue is the first by <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Credit</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>, and the second largest in the four-year history of the $45 billion asset-backed market.
The <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> issue, through <ORGANIZATION>Ford Credit</ORGANIZATION> 1989-A Grantor Trust, was priced at a yield spread of 95 basis points above the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> 7 3/4% issue due July 1991.
The offering is rated doubleA-2 by <ORGANIZATION>Moody's</ORGANIZATION> and double-A by <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION>, based on the quality of the underlying auto loans and a guarantee covering 9% of the deal from <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Credit</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Turner Broadcasting System Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it formed a unit to make and distribute movies to theaters overseas and, eventually, to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> theaters, too. 
The operator of cable-television networks said the new <ORGANIZATION>Turner Pictures</ORGANIZATION> unit will produce movies that will premiere on <ORGANIZATION>Turner Broadcasting</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Turner Network Television</ORGANIZATION> channel, or TNT, and then will be released internationally in movie theaters. 
The unit's first two offerings are slated to be "The Secret Life of <PERSON>Ian Fleming</PERSON>," a dramatization about the former <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> spy who wrote the <PERSON>James Bond</PERSON> novels, and "Treasure Island," produced by <PERSON>Charlton Heston</PERSON>, who also stars in the movie. 
<PERSON>Ted Turner</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Turner Broadcasting</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, was named chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Turner Pictures</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Gerry Hogan</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Turner Entertainment Networks</ORGANIZATION>, was named president of the unit. 
In an interview, <PERSON>Mr. Hogan</PERSON> said the subsidiary's primary mission will be to make movies for <ORGANIZATION>TNT</ORGANIZATION> and to distribute them internationally.
But he said <ORGANIZATION>Turner Broadcasting</ORGANIZATION> already has found some ideas that might work well as films for theatrical release in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
"When that occurs, and when the time is right, we'll release the films in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>," he said, adding that <PERSON>Turner Pictures</PERSON> may develop such movies next year for domestic release in 1991. 
In July, <ORGANIZATION>Viacom Inc.</ORGANIZATION> formed <ORGANIZATION>Viacom Pictures</ORGANIZATION> to produce 12 low-budget movies a year that will premiere on Showtime network and be distributed later in various markets, including foreign theaters. 
<ORGANIZATION>Rockwell International Corp.</ORGANIZATION> bought out <ORGANIZATION>Ikegai Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's interest in <LOCATION>Ikegai-Goss</LOCATION>, a joint venture of the two companies based in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>.
The agreement provides that <ORGANIZATION>Ikegai Corp.</ORGANIZATION> will remain a supplier to <ORGANIZATION>Ikegai-Goss</ORGANIZATION>, which makes printing presses for the newspaper industry.
The purchase was made by <ORGANIZATION>Rockwell Graphic Systems</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> subsidiary of the <LOCATION>El Segundo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, concern. 
<ORGANIZATION>Varian Associates Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, reported fiscal fourth-quarter profit plunged more than 95% to $1 million, or five cents a share, from $24.2 million, or $1.10 a share, in the year-earlier quarter. 
Shares of <LOCATION>Varian</LOCATION>, which last month warned there would be a fourth-quarter plunge, closed at $22.75, down 62.5 cents in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 
Undeterred by such words of caution, corporate <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is flocking to <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, lured by a huge untapped market and <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON>'s attempt to overhaul the Soviet economy.
Doing business with the Russians, once the pursuit of a handful of hardened veterans, has become the goal of such major companies as <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Federal Express Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Procter & Gamble Co.</ORGANIZATION>, as well as a cluster of smaller firms.
Reflecting the new-found interest, more than 140 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies are taking part in a <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> exhibition organized by <PERSON>Mr. Forrester</PERSON>'s trade group. 
"You have to go out to all your constituents," says <PERSON>James H. Giffen</PERSON>, who is spearheading the most ambitious attempt by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> firms to break into the Soviet market, involving investment of more than $5 billion in some two dozen joint ventures.
As part of that attempt, by the <ORGANIZATION>American Trade Consortium</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Giffen</PERSON> says he spends a lot of time lobbying. 
For political as well as economic reasons, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies are at the top of his priorities -- a point he underscored by spending two hours walking around the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade show last week. 
Talking to a small group of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> executives afterwards, <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON> appeared impatient for a big expansion in U.S.-Soviet trade, which now amounts to a meager $3 billion annually.
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ranks fourth of countries that have concluded joint ventures, behind <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>.
According to several people present at the meeting, <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON> also supported the idea of concluding several commercial accords with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, possibly at his next summit meeting with President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Shelley M. Zeiger</PERSON>, an entrepreneur from <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> who buys Soviet porcelain and "matryoshka" nesting dolls for export to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, says West German companies already have snapped up much of the production of these items. 
Seeking to overcome the currency problems, <PERSON>Mr. Giffen</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>American Trade Consortium</ORGANIZATION>, which comprises <ORGANIZATION>Chevron Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Johnson & Johnson</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Eastman Kodak Co.</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.</ORGANIZATION>, has concocted an elaborate scheme to share out dollar earnings, largely from the revenues of a planned <LOCATION>Chevron</LOCATION> oil project.
Several medical concerns, including <ORGANIZATION>Pfizer Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Colgate</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Abbott Laboratories</ORGANIZATION> intend to pursue a similar consortium approach. 
"It's hard to invest capital here on the same basis as investing in other countries," says <PERSON>Dennis A. Sokol</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Medical Service Partners Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, who is putting the medical consortium together. 
According to <PERSON>Richard P. Mills</PERSON>, a Boston-based official of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> partner, 10,000 copies of the quarterly will be printed in <LOCATION>Russian</LOCATION> from next year.
"The opposition can be the most hurt because everyone already figures the <ORGANIZATION>LDP</ORGANIZATION> is that kind of beast," says <PERSON>Shigezo Hayasaka</PERSON>, former aide to <ORGANIZATION>LDP</ORGANIZATION> kingmaker <PERSON>Kakuei Tanaka</PERSON> and now an independent analyst.
Also, about 60% of pachinko parlor owners are Korean, many of whom maintain close ties with <LOCATION>North</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>South Korean</LOCATION> residents' organizations, and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
The magazine alleged that in making the donations, the pachinko industry may have been offering bribes to win support in the battle against prepaid cards, or it may have been laundering money back and forth between the <ORGANIZATION>JSP</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>North Korean</LOCATION> residents' organization, the <ORGANIZATION>Chosen Soren</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Chosen Soren</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>JSP</ORGANIZATION> immediately denied the report.
Then the two camps upped the ante: Reports that <PERSON>Chosen Soren</PERSON> had donated directly to <ORGANIZATION>JSP</ORGANIZATION> members were rapidly countered by statements that the <LOCATION>South Korean</LOCATION> residents' organization had long been donating directly to <ORGANIZATION>LDP</ORGANIZATION> members. 
The <ORGANIZATION>JSP</ORGANIZATION> admitted Oct. 13 that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization, and charged <ORGANIZATION>LDP</ORGANIZATION> members with receiving 125 million yen ($880,000) and other opposition parties with taking about 2.5 million yen.
The issue is further complicated because although the organizations represent <LOCATION>Korean</LOCATION> residents, those residents were largely born and raised in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and many speak only Japanese.
That they retain Korean citizenship and ties is a reflection of history -- their parents were shipped in as laborers during the decades when <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> occupied <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> before World War II -- and the discrimination that still faces Koreans in Japanese society. 
But <ORGANIZATION>LDP</ORGANIZATION> members and supporters of the prepaid card idea tend to speak in innuendo about the <ORGANIZATION>JSP</ORGANIZATION>'s alleged donations, implying that <LOCATION>North Korean</LOCATION> money would be more suspect than <LOCATION>South Korean</LOCATION> because <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> is communist and <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> is an ally. 
<LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s new school chief is the hard-nosed <PERSON>Ted Kimbrough</PERSON>.
At his old job in <LOCATION>Compton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, he took a bitter teachers' strike and nearly came to blows with a school-board member.
In <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, the new Chancellor, <PERSON>Joseph Fernandez</PERSON>, has landed like a 16-inch shell in the middle of a system that has been impervious to serious reform. 
Former <LOCATION>Patterson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, principal <PERSON>Joe Clark</PERSON> was no doubt the general public's first experience with this new breed of no-nonsense administrator.
<PERSON>Elena Scambio</PERSON>, the woman assigned to run the <LOCATION>Jersey City</LOCATION> school system that was taken over by the state, says her top priority will be to "cut through the dead hand of bureaucracy." 
<PERSON>Mr. Fernandez</PERSON> doesn't take control in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> until January, but already he's roiling the waters.
In his old job, as <LOCATION>Dade County</LOCATION> chief, <PERSON>Mr. Fernandez</PERSON> forced out 92 teachers and reshuffled 48 principals.
Getting a community of parents to care again about its schools is essential, but in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> the new boards will make mistakes and <PERSON>Mr. Kimbrough</PERSON> will have to identify them. 
The rise of superintendents such as <PERSON>Joseph Fernandez</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ted Kimbrough</PERSON> suggests plainly the process of disintegration in many school systems.
<PERSON>Belo</PERSON> said it increased its effective tax rate to 52% from 47% to account for potential liabilities related to an <ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION> investigation of its tax returns for the years 1984 through 1988. 
Also, <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Stephen Wolf</PERSON> pulled out of the buy-out effort to focus on running the company.
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Pacific</ORGANIZATION> plans to sell 20% of its large real estate unit to a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> pension fund for $400 million and spin the rest off to shareholders.
<ORGANIZATION>Amerada Hess</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Occidental Petroleum</ORGANIZATION> had gains. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, <PERSON>Kenneth Roman</PERSON>, is leaving to take a top post at <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>.
His resignation follows a hostile takeover of the ad agency in May by <ORGANIZATION>WPP</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> was sued by money manager <PERSON>George Soros</PERSON>, who claimed one of his funds was defrauded out of $60 million during stock-index futures trading just after the 1987 crash. 
<ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> plans a bid for another big French financial and industrial firm, <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION>, a sign <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s takeover fever hasn't cooled. 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Daiwa Securities</ORGANIZATION> named <ORGANIZATION>Masahiro Dozen</ORGANIZATION> president.
<ORGANIZATION>Tandy Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it won't join <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Memories</ORGANIZATION>, the group that seeks to battle the Japanese in the market for computer memory chips. 
<PERSON>Tandy</PERSON>'s decision is a second setback for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Memories.
<ORGANIZATION>Tandy</ORGANIZATION> said its experience during the shortage didn't merit the $5 million to $50 million investment <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Memories is seeking from each investor. "At this time, we elected not to get involved because we have been able to satisfy our need {for DRAMs} from the market as a rule," said <PERSON>Ed Juge</PERSON>, <PERSON>Tandy</PERSON>'s director of market planning. 
<PERSON>Sanford Kane</PERSON>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Memories president, said the decision was "disappointing," but doesn't presage <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Memories' failure. "I would like to have had them," he said.
<PERSON>Mr. Kane</PERSON> became president and chief executive officer of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Memories last June, when the group was formed by seven electronics companies: <ORGANIZATION>Advanced Micro Devices Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment Corp.</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard Co.</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Intel Corp.</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>LSI Logic Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>National Semiconductor Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Kane</PERSON> said he expects two or three major corporations to announce their participation in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Memories soon after the group finishes a business plan, probably late this week.
<ORGANIZATION>Sun Microsystems Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it's still actively evaluating <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Memories and plans to meet with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Memories representatives later this week. 
<ORGANIZATION>American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ORGANIZATION> said it was waiting to see <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Memories</ORGANIZATION>' business plan.
The per-share loss for the <LOCATION>Paramus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, food-services concern totaled seven cents, compared with earnings of 51 cents a share a year earlier.
<ORGANIZATION>Coniston</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investment partnership, awaits a vote by <ORGANIZATION>TW</ORGANIZATION>'s shareholders, scheduled for Friday, on <ORGANIZATION>Coniston</ORGANIZATION>'s $34-a-share, or $1.66 billion, offer for <ORGANIZATION>TW</ORGANIZATION>. 
Right now he takes people out to fish in the bays behind the barrier islands that curve for hundreds of miles along the eastern coast of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, enclosing milky green lagoons behind ridges of sand and grassy scrub that rim the deep blue of the <LOCATION>Gulf</LOCATION> beyond. 
Jutting out just to the north of us is the <ORGANIZATION>Blackjack Peninsula</ORGANIZATION> (after the oak, not the game) which forms the core of the <ORGANIZATION>Aransas Wildlife Refuge</ORGANIZATION>.
Inland a few miles from the refuge there is a place called <LOCATION>Tivoli</LOCATION>, with a white church, a gas station and a grocery, the houses relatively close together for such a settlement in these parts. "<PERSON>Tivoli Motel</PERSON>," I read a sign in the usual pronunciation of the name as we whoosh through. "Here in <LOCATION>south Texas</LOCATION> we say Tie-vole-ee," my host gently corrects. 
<PERSON>Mr. King</PERSON> is the director of the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Press Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
When <PERSON>Anne Volokh</PERSON> and her family immigrated to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 14 years ago, they started life in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> with only $400.
They'd actually left the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> with $480, but during a stop in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> Ms. Volokh dropped $80 on a black velvet suit.
Most recently, she has become the publisher of <LOCATION>Movieline</LOCATION>, a four-year-old <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> magazine that began national distribution last month, with an initial press run of 100,000 copies.
Distributed by the <ORGANIZATION>Hearst Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Eastern News</ORGANIZATION>, the glossy publication melds <ORGANIZATION>Vanity Fair</ORGANIZATION>'s gossipy archness and Premiere's earnest delving into behind-the-scenes minutiae, with a special emphasis on <LOCATION>Tinseltown</LOCATION> as fashion trendsetter.
Though <PERSON>Ms. Volokh</PERSON> is a small woman, she has an outsized personality and dramatic flair that seem perfectly suited to capitalism as it is practiced in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>.
However, she remembers the lean years and recalls with relish wearing her first major American purchase -- that turban10 years later and having a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> boutique owner ask her if it was a <ORGANIZATION>Chanel</ORGANIZATION>.
Are the hats merely part of her new <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> persona, along with the many ultra-thin <PERSON>Capri</PERSON> cigarettes she smokes, the parties she throws for 500 people, the <LOCATION>Chekovian</LOCATION> feasts she offers guests at her weekend place in <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION>? 
At <LOCATION>Movieline</LOCATION>, she wants "specific paragraphing, specific tone, a specific attitude -- bright and bold and tongue-in-cheek." In restaurants (in this case, the <LOCATION>Russian Samovar</LOCATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> restaurant operated by and for Soviet emigres), she didn't want the chirpy, folkish music bouncing through the room. "You people here think this is <LOCATION>Russian</LOCATION> music," she said with disdain, and called over to the waitress: "Could you turn it off?" 
That done, <PERSON>Ms. Volokh</PERSON> spoke with rampant eloquence about the many attributes she feels she was born with: an understanding of food, business, <LOCATION>Russian</LOCATION> culture, human nature, and parties. "Parties are rather a state of mind," she said, pausing only to taste and pass judgment on the <LOCATION>Georgian</LOCATION> shashlik ("a little well done, but very good"). "If you are born to give parties, you give parties.
The idea for <ORGANIZATION>Movieline</ORGANIZATION> actually was dreamed up by an old friend of the Volokhs, <PERSON>Boris Krutchensky</PERSON> (who has the title of co-publisher), and <PERSON>Laurie Halpern Smith</PERSON>, now the magazine's co-editor.
<PERSON>Mr. Krutchensky</PERSON> approached <PERSON>Ms. Volokh</PERSON> five years ago about backing the publication, which started out as a listing guide.
Back in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> she was a respected journalist, writing a weekly column about the national cuisine for Sunday <LOCATION>Izvestia</LOCATION>.
"I don't trust people who don't eat," said <PERSON>Ms. Volokh</PERSON>, though she herself stopped eating lunch a few years ago to drop 25 pounds. "Look at <LOCATION>Dostoevski</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kafka</LOCATION>.
No one ever eats in their books and look at them. . . . Tolstoy's characters eat, <PERSON>Pushkin</PERSON>'s, <ORGANIZATION>Gogol's</ORGANIZATION>." In her cookbook, which <PERSON>Macmillan</PERSON> is bringing out in soft cover this month (with the blini recipe revised so it works), she introduces each chapter with appropriate quotations from <LOCATION>Russian</LOCATION> literature: <PERSON>Pushkin</PERSON> on blini, <PERSON>Goncharov</PERSON> on piroghi.
By 1973, after their second child was born, it had become clear to <PERSON>Ms. Volokh</PERSON> and her husband <PERSON>Vladimir</PERSON>, a computer scientist, that they wanted to leave the U.S.S.R. <PERSON>Ms. Volokh</PERSON> quit her job, to remove herself from the public eye.
<PERSON>Mr. Volokh</PERSON> soon found work in his field, but <PERSON>Ms. Volokh</PERSON> refused the obvious and available occupation-as translatorfor a Russian who spoke fluent English. "That's always looking back," she said. "I wanted to be in business." On the way to that goal, she received her first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> paycheck for proofreading a book of Polish poetry, attended secretarial school, then went to work for a fund-raising organization.
Now <PERSON>Movieline</PERSON> is located in the same building as <ORGANIZATION>Vesoft</ORGANIZATION>. "Things work out unexpectedly in life," said <PERSON>Ms. Volokh</PERSON>. "You never know if you'll be chosen to be the scapegoat or the lucky one.
<PERSON>Norimasa Furuta</PERSON>, president of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Mazda Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said the Japanese car maker is planning joint production with <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> ahead of the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>'s 1992 integration. 
<PERSON>Mr. Furuta</PERSON> didn't disclose further details of the arrangement at a news conference, but said the project would be undertaken with <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s European subsidiary. 
A <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> official confirmed in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> motor vehicle maker is studying such an arrangement. 
<PERSON>Sen. Alan Cranston</PERSON> trekked over to the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> side of <LOCATION>Capitol Hill</LOCATION> a few days ago and volunteered his testimony to fellow Democrat Rep. <PERSON>Henry Gonzalez</PERSON>.
It was offered as an expression of cooperation to <PERSON>Mr. Gonzalez</PERSON>, who is investigating the $2.5 billion failure of <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln Savings & Loan Association</ORGANIZATION>. 
But instead of thanks, <PERSON>Sen. Cranston</PERSON> was treated with cool formality. "Every witness receives a formal subpoena," Rep. <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> told him. 
Seldom have <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> hearings caused so much apprehension in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, where <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> <PERSON>Sen. Cranston</PERSON> and four other senators were already writhing in the glare of unfavorable publicity over the alleged looting of <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION> by their friend and political benefactor, <PERSON>Charles Keating Jr.</PERSON>, principal stockholder of <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION>American Continental Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz</LOCATION>. 
At the first day of the <ORGANIZATION>House Banking Committee</ORGANIZATION>'s hearings last week, <PERSON>William Seidman</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Resolution Trust Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the federal agency created to sell sick thrifts, said the agency is investigating whether <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> made illegal political contributions.
<PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> arranged nearly $1 million in donations to <PERSON>Sen. Cranston</PERSON> and his various political causes, and hundreds of thousands more to other lawmakers.
Unlike many lawmakers, Chairman <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> says he considers intervening with regulators to be improper. "When you reach a point where a policy-making body is trying to shape administrative decisions, then that's a no-no in my book," the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> lawmaker says.
In the recent <ORGANIZATION>Housing and Urban Development Department</ORGANIZATION> scandal, for example, Rep. <PERSON>Thomas Lantos</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Democrat who led the hearings, tiptoed through embarrassing disclosures about <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> grants secured by <PERSON>Sen. Alfonse D'Amato</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Republican. 
He comes from the same political line as <PERSON>Wright Patman</PERSON>, a bank-baiting <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> populist who chaired the <ORGANIZATION>Banking Committee</ORGANIZATION> until 1974.
The immediate target of Rep. <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON>'s inquiry is <PERSON>Danny Wall</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Thrift Supervision</ORGANIZATION>.
As the principal regulator of the thrift industry, <PERSON>Mr. Wall</PERSON> delayed seizing Lincoln S&L for more than two years after his staff told him that the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> thrift was insolvent and that potential losses to taxpayers were growing rapidly. 
Rep. <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> seems primed to lash out at <PERSON>Mr. Wall</PERSON> when hearings resume Thursday with testimony by two federal regulators from <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, <PERSON>William Black</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mike Patriarca</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr. Wall</PERSON> relieved them of responsibility for supervising <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln</ORGANIZATION> in 1988.
<PERSON>Mr. Gonzalez</PERSON> expressed concern over a report that the two had been summoned to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> by <PERSON>Mr. Wall</PERSON> last week to discuss their testimony in advance. "I think he is trying to improperly influence a witness, and by God I'm not going to tolerate it," he says. 
<PERSON>Mr. Wall</PERSON>, however, is a self-proclaimed "child of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>" and former staff director of its <ORGANIZATION>Banking Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
An inquiry into his handling of <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION> S&L inevitably will drag in <PERSON>Sen. Cranston</PERSON> and the four others, <LOCATION>Sens.</LOCATION>
<PERSON>Dennis DeConcini</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>John McCain</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>John Glenn</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>) and <PERSON>Donald Riegle</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>).
They all attended a meeting in April 1987 questioning why a federal audit of <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln S&L</ORGANIZATION> had dragged on for two years. "I'm certain that in the course of the hearings the names {of the senators} will be brought out," <PERSON>Mr. Gonzalez</PERSON> says. 
This is raising eyebrows. "When I first got a glimpse at the witness list, I couldn't believe that they were going to go ahead and do this," says <PERSON>Michael Waldman</PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION>Congress Watch</ORGANIZATION>, a consumer group. "There are some witnesses who will be forced to testify about their meetings with senators." 
And a <ORGANIZATION>Democratic</ORGANIZATION> aide to a <ORGANIZATION>Banking Committee</ORGANIZATION> member remarks, "I too am astounded by it, because <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> has certainly placed a lot of <ORGANIZATION>Democratic</ORGANIZATION> senators in a very bad position." 
<PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> lives in <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> thrift's parent is an Ohio-chartered corporation with holdings in <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>. 
Chairman <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> expresses sympathy for <PERSON>Sen. Riegle</PERSON>, his counterpart as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Banking Committee</ORGANIZATION>. "He's wise, he's good and I know he's an honest man," the <LOCATION>Texan</LOCATION> says.
But at the same time, <PERSON>Mr. Gonzalez</PERSON> hasn't forgotten a confrontation over <PERSON>Mr. Wall</PERSON> during <ORGANIZATION>House-Senate</ORGANIZATION> negotiations over S&L bailout legislation during the summer.
<PERSON>Cranston</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Riegle</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Mr. Wall</PERSON>'s principal sponsor, Republican <PERSON>Sen. Jake Garn</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>. 
They were willing to trade important provisions in the bailout legislation to preserve <PERSON>Mr. Wall</PERSON>'s job and to avoid a reconfirmation hearing in which he would be called upon to testify about <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln S&L</ORGANIZATION>.
Most importantly, the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> traded away the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration's controversial plan to finance the bailout, which was partly reinstated later. 
At the time, <PERSON>Mr. Gonzalez</PERSON> said several senators told him that they "could get some roadblocks out of the way if there could be some understanding on <PERSON>Garn</PERSON>'s insistence on Wall." Now <PERSON>Mr. Gonzalez</PERSON> is holding the equivalent of reconfirmation hearings anyway, under the guise of the <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION> investigation. "In a way, that's what this is," <PERSON>Mr. Gonzalez</PERSON> concedes. 
<PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> raised $20,000 for Rep. <PERSON>Doug Barnard</PERSON>'s 1986 re-election campaign while the <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> Democrat was taking his side against regulators who wanted to curb risky investments and wholesale deposit brokering.
Rep. <PERSON>Jim Leach</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>) says the <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln S&L</ORGANIZATION> affair is "the biggest bank heist in history," and adds: "The great question that remains to be resolved is whether we have a congressional Watergate in the making." 
But the witness, <PERSON>William Crawford</PERSON>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s chief state thrift regulator, denies saying that. "I don't know whether it was done properly or not, because I'm not a lawyer," he said in a telephone interview yesterday.
The committee also has summoned <PERSON>Mr. Wall</PERSON>'s predecessor, <LOCATION>Edwin Gray</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Sen. Cranston</PERSON>, as he returned to the capital last week from a one-day trip to inspect earthquake damage in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, sighed to an aide: "Well, back to <LOCATION>Keatingland</LOCATION>." 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Bankers Trust</ORGANIZATION> fell 12.5 cents to $50.50. 
<ORGANIZATION>Liz Claiborne Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said its third-quarter net income jumped 62%, citing continued strength in apparel sales and the start of shipments of its new product lines: a men's fragrance, large-size women's apparel and casual knitwear. 
As <PERSON>Helen Boehm</PERSON>, who owns an art porcelain company, sipped her luncheon cocktail, she reeled off the names of a few pals -- Prince <PERSON>Charles</PERSON>, Princess <PERSON>Diana</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sarah Ferguson</PERSON>, <PERSON>John Kluge</PERSON>, <PERSON>Milton Petrie</PERSON>. 
Then, flashing a diamond ring as big as the Ritz ("my day diamond, darling"), she told her two companions that she is on the "board" of the <LOCATION>Vatican Museum</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>. 
As it turns out, the board has a lot of important members, including <PERSON>Winton Blount</PERSON> (former postmaster general of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Mrs. Henry Gaisman</PERSON> (widow of the inventor of auto-strop razor) and <PERSON>Vincent Murphy</PERSON> (an investment banker at <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION>) But <PERSON>Mrs. Boehm</PERSON> didn't mention any of them. 
"<PERSON>Helen Boehm</PERSON> has a way with names," says <PERSON>James Revson</PERSON>, a gossip columnist for Newsday (and son of <PERSON>Joseph Revson</PERSON>, a founder of <ORGANIZATION>Revlon</ORGANIZATION>).
"Name-dropping is pervasive and getting more so as society becomes more complex and alienating," says <PERSON>Herbert Freudenberger</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> psychoanalyst, with a high-powered clientele. "It can be an avenue of entrance to a certain sector of society. . . . It provides some people a needed sense of affiliation and can help open up a conversation with someone you don't know." 
Like the <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION> matron in the theater district the other day who swore to a stranger that she once met <PERSON>Liza Minnelli</PERSON>. "I was having a drink in <LOCATION>Sardi</LOCATION>'s, when all of a sudden I saw a woman's backside coming up the steps on the second floor and she was wearing sequined slacks.
<PERSON>Beauregard Houston-Montgomery</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> writer who changed his name from <PERSON>William Stretch</PERSON> in 1980, is an inveterate name-dropper. "I do it innately and pathologically, and while it may occasionally get me into trouble, it's also gotten me access to parties and society," he says. 
Name-dropping recently helped <PERSON>Mr. Houston-Montgomery</PERSON> crash a party Fame magazine threw for 100 of the 2,809 people mentioned in the diaries of the late <PERSON>Andy Warhol</PERSON>. "I guess I might have asked <PERSON>Beauregard</PERSON> to leave, but he drops so many good names, we decided to let him stay," says <PERSON>Steven Greenberg</PERSON>, publisher of Fame. "After all, Warhol was the ultimate namedropper, dropping five a day in his diaries.
<PERSON>Mr. Houston-Montgomery</PERSON> says that at the party he waved to <PERSON>Malcolm Forbes</PERSON>, publisher of Forbes magazine ("We've been in the columns together"), <PERSON>Mary Boone</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> art dealer ("I think she knows me, but I'm not sure ") and <PERSON>Bridget Fonda</PERSON>, the actress ("She knows me, but we're not really the best of friends"). 
These droppers don't flaunt only their friendships with the Trumps, <PERSON>Brooke Astor</PERSON> or <PERSON>Georgette Mosbacher</PERSON>. "They even drop semi-obscure names like <PERSON>Wolfgang Flottl</PERSON>, whom everybody these days apparently has heard of but no one really knows," says <PERSON>Mr. Revson</PERSON>. "It's the one-upsmanship of name-dropping that counts." 
It has gotten a bad rep because its once heavily polluted <LOCATION>Cuyahoga River</LOCATION> caught fire, because former Mayor <PERSON>Ralph Perk</PERSON> set his hair on fire with an acetylene torch and because its proposed Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame was recently refused an urban-development grant.
"It helps to point out how many important people came through <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> on their way to the top," says <PERSON>George Miller</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>New Cleveland Campaign</ORGANIZATION>, a nonprofit organization devoted to citing the city's strengths. 
<PERSON>Mr. Miller</PERSON> notes that actor <PERSON>Paul Newman</PERSON>'s family owned a sporting-goods store in <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, that the late actress <PERSON>Margaret Hamilton</PERSON>, who played the bad witch in "The Wizard Of Oz," once ran a nursery school in <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> and that comedian <PERSON>Bob Hope</PERSON>'s father, a stonemason, once worked on a church next to Severence Hall, <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>'s main concert hall. "Power names like that don't hurt the city's reputation," <PERSON>Mr. Miller</PERSON> says. 
In <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>, an average family can gain cachet from moving into a home vacated by the famous or near famous. "Why we even just sold a three-bedroom house in <LOCATION>Van Nuys</LOCATION> and were able to keep the price firm in a weak real-estate market by noting that the original <PERSON>Lone Ranger</PERSON> lived there," says <PERSON>David Rambo</PERSON>, a sales associate with <ORGANIZATION>Jon Douglas Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> real-estate agency. "Most people can't even remember his name." (It is <PERSON>John Hart</PERSON>.) 
<PERSON>Mr. Rambo</PERSON> says that a 3.2-acre property overlooking the <LOCATION>San Fernando Valley</LOCATION> is priced at $4 million because the late actor <PERSON>Erroll Flynn</PERSON> once lived there. "If <PERSON>Flynn</PERSON> hadn't lived there, the property might have been priced $1 million lower," says <PERSON>Mr. Rambo</PERSON>, noting that <PERSON>Flynn</PERSON>'s house has been bulldozed, and only the swimming pool remains. 
<PERSON>Len Kessler</PERSON>, a financial publicist in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, sometimes uses it to get the attention of journalists who try to avoid him.
He says that when <PERSON>Dan Dorfman</PERSON>, a financial columnist with <ORGANIZATION>USA Today</ORGANIZATION>, hasn't returned his phone calls, he leaves messages with <PERSON>Mr. Dorfman</PERSON>'s office saying that he has an important story on <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>, <PERSON>Meshulam Riklis</PERSON> or <PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Jeffry Thal</PERSON>, a publicity agent for the <ORGANIZATION>Lantz Office</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, warns that dropping the wrong name labels the dropper as a fake and a fraud. "Get caught and you're dead in the water," says <PERSON>Mr. Thal</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Thal</PERSON> says that <PERSON>Elizabeth Taylor</PERSON>, a client, "hates being called `Liz. '. . . If directors or producers phone me and say they know `Liz, ' I know they've never met her.
In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> society, <PERSON>Pat Buckley</PERSON>, the very social wife of author <PERSON>William Buckley</PERSON>, has the nicknames "Mrs.
<PERSON>John Spencer Churchill</PERSON>, a nephew of the late Sir <PERSON>Winston Churchill</PERSON>, former prime minister of <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>, isn't that impressed with most name-droppers he meets.
Currently writing his memoirs, <PERSON>Mr. Churchill</PERSON>, an artist, tells how tycoons such as the late <PERSON>Jean Paul Getty</PERSON>, the oil billionnaire, were, in fact, known only by one initial, their last. "When you're at the club, you ask whether they've spoken to `G.' Now they know who you mean and you know who you mean.
A group of shareholders filed suit against <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>First Executive Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and others, charging them with artificially inflating Imperial's stock price to protect certain major investors. 
Spokesmen at <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION> said the companies hadn't yet been served with the suit. 
In a separate complaint also filed in federal court here, shareholder <PERSON>Max Grill</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> charged Imperial, its top executives and directors with breach of fiduciary duty and squandering the company's assets.
<ORGANIZATION>LDI Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, said it will offer $50 million in commercial paper backed by lease-rental receivables.
<ORGANIZATION>LDI</ORGANIZATION> termed the paper "non-recourse financing," meaning that investors would be repaid from the lease receivables, rather than directly by <ORGANIZATION>LDI Corp</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>LDI</ORGANIZATION> leases and sells data-processing, telecommunications and other high-tech equipment. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ingersoll Publications Co.</ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy the New Haven Register in a transaction valued at $275 million from <ORGANIZATION>Goodson Newspaper Group Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
As part of the agreement, <ORGANIZATION>Goodson</ORGANIZATION> also terminated the contract under which Ingersoll manages <ORGANIZATION>Goodson</ORGANIZATION>'s 66 newspapers, ending a long association between the two companies that has turned increasingly bitter recently.
<ORGANIZATION>Goodson</ORGANIZATION> has accused Ingersoll of paying less attention to its properties and more to such ventures as the recent launch of the <LOCATION>St. Louis Sun</LOCATION>. 
Under the terms of the accord, <ORGANIZATION>Ingersoll</ORGANIZATION> will pay about $255 million for the Register, a daily that <ORGANIZATION>Goodson</ORGANIZATION> bought for about $170 million in 1986.
<ORGANIZATION>Goodson</ORGANIZATION> also announced that it hired the former president and senior vice president of Ingersoll to run the <ORGANIZATION>Goodson</ORGANIZATION> papers.
<ORGANIZATION>Goodson</ORGANIZATION>, which is based here, will use part of the proceeds to pay down debt associated with its purchase of the <ORGANIZATION>Morristown Daily Record</ORGANIZATION> for $155 million in 1987.
The <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> paper, like the <LOCATION>New Haven</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, paper, was purchased by <ORGANIZATION>Ingersoll</ORGANIZATION> on <PERSON>Goodson</PERSON>'s behalf as part of the management contract.
<PERSON>David N. Hurwitz</PERSON>, president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION>Goodson</ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview that the company doesn't currently have any plans to sell additional newspapers. 
<PERSON>Goodson</PERSON> said <PERSON>David Carr</PERSON>, former president of <ORGANIZATION>Ingersoll Publications</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Ray Cockburn</PERSON>, former senior vice president, would head the new in-house management team at <ORGANIZATION>Goodson</ORGANIZATION>, which had revenue of $225 million in 1988. 
The association between the two companies stretches back thirty years to a friendship between television producer <PERSON>Mark Goodson</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Ingersoll</ORGANIZATION> founder <ORGANIZATION>Ralph Ingersoll</ORGANIZATION>.
The latter's son, <PERSON>Ralph Ingersoll Jr.</PERSON>, took over the company and has been managing the <ORGANIZATION>Goodson</ORGANIZATION> properties and acting as an agent in the purchase of newspapers for <ORGANIZATION>Goodson</ORGANIZATION>.
But in recent years, <PERSON>Mr. Ingersoll</PERSON> began focusing more on expanding his own newspaper empire in partnership with investment banking firm <ORGANIZATION>Warburg, Pincus & Co</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Ingersoll</ORGANIZATION> has 28 dailies and 200 other non-daily papers in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
Ingersoll President <PERSON>Robert M. Jelenic</PERSON> said in a statement that the company is "delighted by the conclusion of the Goodson relationship" and will be able to "concentrate all our energies" on <ORGANIZATION>Ingersoll</ORGANIZATION>'s own papers.
<PERSON>Mr. Goodson</PERSON>, in his own statement, was less upbeat, saying "unfortunately over the past few years, it has become increasingly clear that <PERSON>Ralph</PERSON> and I have different agendas," and that he feels "more comfortable with a management team whose sole interest and responsibility is in the <ORGANIZATION>Goodson</ORGANIZATION> papers." 
<ORGANIZATION>Westamerica Bancorp.</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Richard W. Decker</PERSON> resigned as president and chief executive officer after only a year on the job because of "differences" with the board. 
<ORGANIZATION>Westamerica</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Mr. Decker</PERSON>'s posts were assumed by <PERSON>David Payne</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Westamerica</LOCATION>'s chairman, who at 34 years of age becomes one of the youngest chief executives of a sizable bank in the country.
Neither <PERSON>Mr. Payne</PERSON> nor <PERSON>Mr. Decker</PERSON> could be reached to comment. 
<LOCATION>Westamerica</LOCATION> has about $1.3 billion of assets and is the largest independent bank in northern <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
When he was hired, <PERSON>Mr. Payne</PERSON> lauded <PERSON>Mr. Decker</PERSON>'s "extraordinary . . . skills" and his "outstanding reputation as one of the West's brightest bankers." 
Though the bank isn't performing as well as some of its competitors in the lucrative <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> market, its condition has improved since <PERSON>Mr. Decker</PERSON> took over.
Interstate banking is scheduled to begin in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> in 1991, and larger <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> banks, such as <ORGANIZATION>Wells Fargo & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, have been paying fat premiums to buy smaller banks to control markets before any out-of-state banks enter the fray. 
In <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Westamerica</ORGANIZATION> closed at $22.25 a share, down 75 cents. 
The 301-year-old exchange is battered by enormous claims from a decade-long run of unprecedented disasters, the most recent of which is last week's earthquake in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>.
"<ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> is on the ropes," says <PERSON>Peter Nutting</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> investor for 17 years who now leads a dissident group threatening to sue exchange underwriters for alleged mismanagement and negligence. "It needs more discipline.
The average after-tax return on investment in 1986, the most recent year for which results are available, was 6.5%, according to <ORGANIZATION>Chatset Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, an insurance consulting firm in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> claims for the 1988 <ORGANIZATION>Piper Alpha</ORGANIZATION> oil-rig disaster in the <LOCATION>North Sea</LOCATION>, for instance, may reach $1 billion. 
The peril of unlimited liability looms large for a number of them now. "I have wished I could die and be out of it -- that's how bad it is," <PERSON>Betty Atkins</PERSON>, a secretary from suburban <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, says. 
<PERSON>Ms. Atkins</PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> membership was a bonus from a former employer in 1981, belongs to <PERSON>Mr. Nutting</PERSON>'s dissident group on the Outhwaite syndicate, which has been hard hit by asbestos reinsurance claims.
<PERSON>Ms. Atkins</PERSON>, who underwrote #20,000, or about $32,000, of insurance coverage on that syndicate, now faces potential losses of roughly #70,000, or $111,000. "If <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> wants #70,000 out of me they will have to take everything I've got -- and even then I don't know if it will be enough," she says. 
Unease is widespread among exchange members. "I can't think of any reason to join <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> now," says <PERSON>Keith Whitten</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> businessman and a <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> member since 1979. "The downside is very considerable, and at the moment the upside is very marginal." If profits don't improve, <PERSON>Mr. Whitten</PERSON> says he may quit the exchange. 
<ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> 66% stake in that market has shrunk to 50% in that period, according to an official at the <ORGANIZATION>Institute of London Underwriters</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> competitor. (The official asked not to be named.) Much of the business has gone to the institute, an association of more than 100 insurers, including <ORGANIZATION>Cigna Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Allianz Versicherungs AG</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Commercial Union Assurance PLC</ORGANIZATION>. 
Today, <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> share of the world market, excluding life insurance, is about 2%. (Its stake is even smaller if life insurance is included.) Bigger rivals, such as <ORGANIZATION>Aetna</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Allianz</PERSON>, backed by armies of statisticians using computers in hundreds of branches, operate more efficiently and often can offer lower rates, brokers say.
But since 1981, <ORGANIZATION>Kirk Horse Insurance Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Lexington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION> has grabbed a 20% stake of the market. 
<PERSON>Ronald Kirk</PERSON>, president, says <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> has suffered because its structure doesn't allow underwriters to deal directly with clients; brokers are required intermediaries.
Thus, he asserts, <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> can't react quickly to competition. "<ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> has lost control of the situation," he says. "They aren't controlling their destiny like they used to." 
<PERSON>Murray Lawrence</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> chairman, agrees the exchange faces big challenges. "This is a watershed time, and we are trying to plot our way ahead," he says. "We have been a great market for inventing risks which other people then take, copy and cut rates." 
Three years ago, the exchange took up residence in a space-age tower of steel and glass -- evocative of the kind of modern architecture that <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> has denounced. (Some exchange wags call the building "the oil rig.") But along with such treasured artifacts as <PERSON>Lord Nelson</PERSON>'s spyglass, <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> also brought its outmoded ways of doing business. 
"The system," says <PERSON>Nicholas Samengo-Turner</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> broker who left the exchange in 1985, "is so ludicrously unprofessional it drives you mad." 
<PERSON>John Wetherell</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> underwriter, says he and his fellow underwriters underestimated by as much as 50% the premiums they should have charged for property risks from 1980 to 1985. "How unprofessional we must have appeared to the outside world -- how incompetent at risk assessment and evaluation," he says.
Many at <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> expect the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> earthquake will cause the industry to boost rates even further.
Insurance analysts say the exchange's downturn in profitability is likely to be aggravated by more than $600 million in aviation losses (including the 1988 <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> airline disaster over <LOCATION>Lockerbie</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>) and a still-uncalculated chunk of claims from September's Hurricane Hugo. 
<ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> presently sells only auto insurance directly to the public, and such policies are sold only in limited markets such as the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Allied-Signal</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at $35.125, off 87.5 cents. 
<ORGANIZATION>AEG AG</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Siemens AG</ORGANIZATION> said they will launch their previously announced joint venture for power semiconductors in January. 
<ORGANIZATION>AEG</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Siemens</ORGANIZATION> each will hold a 50% stake in the venture. 
<ORGANIZATION>Siemens</ORGANIZATION> is <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>'s largest electronics group.
<ORGANIZATION>AEG</ORGANIZATION> is 80% owned by <ORGANIZATION>Daimler-Benz AG</ORGANIZATION>, the country's biggest industrial concern. 
In <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Enviropact</ORGANIZATION> closed at $3 a share, up 25 cents. 
<ORGANIZATION>GSX</ORGANIZATION> is a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Laidlaw Transportation Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Burlington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>National Semiconductor Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and a start-up named <ORGANIZATION>Ramtron Corp.</ORGANIZATION> plan to start shipping so-called ferroelectric memories, which can remember data for at least 10 years without any current flowing to them.
But <PERSON>Ramtron</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Colorado Springs</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, plans to start shipping commercial quantities of simple ferroelectric chips in December.
National Semiconductor is getting ferroelectric technology from <ORGANIZATION>Krysalis Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Albuquerque</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.M. National</LOCATION> says it agreed to acquire <PERSON>Krysalis</PERSON>'s assets and will start shipping commercial quantities of its first chips, including a 4-kilobit memory, next year. 
AN <LOCATION>AUSTIN</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, company plans to make it easy for you show up in court a thousand miles away without leaving town. 
The company installed a prototype system that connects <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> with <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> over digital phone lines.
And it is preparing to set up shop in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and 10 other cities where court-reporting agencies can tie conference rooms into the network. 
JAPAN'S MISUSE of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> patents has been a sore point for <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> chip makers.
But last year <ORGANIZATION>Hitachi Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> surprised <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s electronics industry when it accused <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Samsung Electronics Co.</ORGANIZATION> of using <PERSON>Hitachi</PERSON> technology to make dynamic random-access memory chips. (A settlement was reached but wasn't made public.) And <PERSON>Hitachi</PERSON> went on the offensive against the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Motorola Inc.</ORGANIZATION> earlier this month with a suit charging that <ORGANIZATION>Motorola</ORGANIZATION>'s new MC88200 chip infringes on a <LOCATION>Hitachi</LOCATION> patent. 
Another recent <PERSON>Hitachi</PERSON> suit accuses <ORGANIZATION>Motorola</ORGANIZATION> of reverse engineering a Hitachi technology -- a turnabout from a nation of champion reverse engineers. 
<PERSON>Hitachi</PERSON> made the reverse-engineering charges in an amendment to a counterclaim filed in a federal district court in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> after <ORGANIZATION>Motorola</ORGANIZATION> sued <PERSON>Hitachi</PERSON> for patent violation.
Hitachi charges <ORGANIZATION>Motorola</ORGANIZATION> "has engaged in fraudulent and inequitable conduct in the procurement of certain <ORGANIZATION>Motorola</ORGANIZATION> patents" used in <ORGANIZATION>Motorola</ORGANIZATION>'s MC68030 microprocessor chip. 
Translation: <ORGANIZATION>Motorola</ORGANIZATION> appears to have taken a <LOCATION>Hitachi</LOCATION> technology that is patented in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hitachi</PERSON> says, and "tried to make it look like a new technology." 
COMPUTER chips that simulate human vision have been developed by <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Sharp Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Sharp</PERSON> says the set of chips could improve fax machines, graphics computers or identification systems that recognize facial features. . . . An <ORGANIZATION>N.V. Philips</ORGANIZATION> unit has created a computer system that processes video images 3,000 times faster than conventional systems.
Using reduced instruction-set computing, or RISC, chips made by <ORGANIZATION>Intergraph</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, the system splits the image it "sees" into 20 digital representations, each processed by one chip. 
<ORGANIZATION>GAF</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Part III</ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to begin today. 
After two mistrials, the stakes in the stock manipulation trial of <ORGANIZATION>GAF Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and its vice chairman, <PERSON>James T. Sherwin</PERSON>, have changed considerably.
In an eight-count indictment, the government charged <ORGANIZATION>GAF</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Wayne</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, chemical maker, and <PERSON>Mr. Sherwin</PERSON> with illegally attempting to manipulate the common stock of <ORGANIZATION>Union Carbide Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in advance of <ORGANIZATION>GAF</ORGANIZATION>'s planned sale of a large block of the stock in 1986. 
The government's credibility in the <ORGANIZATION>GAF</ORGANIZATION> case depended heavily on its star witness, <PERSON>Boyd L. Jefferies</PERSON>, the former <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> brokerage chief who was implicated by former arbitrager <PERSON>Ivan Boesky</PERSON>, and then pointed the finger at <PERSON>Mr. Sherwin</PERSON>, takeover speculator <PERSON>Salim B. Lewis</PERSON> and corporate raider <PERSON>Paul Bilzerian</PERSON>.
The <ORGANIZATION>GAF</ORGANIZATION> trials were viewed as previews of the government's strength in its cases against <PERSON>Mr. Lewis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Bilzerian</PERSON>.
The first <ORGANIZATION>GAF</ORGANIZATION> trial ended in a mistrial after four weeks when <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Mary Johnson Lowe</PERSON> found that a prosecutor improperly, but unintentionally, withheld a document.
The mistrials have left the reputations of <ORGANIZATION>GAF</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Sherwin</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>GAF</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Samuel Heyman</PERSON> in limbo.
There is much speculation among attorneys not involved that the strategy of <ORGANIZATION>GAF</ORGANIZATION>'s attorney, <PERSON>Arthur Liman</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Mr. Sherwin</PERSON>'s counsel, <PERSON>Stephen Kaufman</PERSON>, will include testimony by <PERSON>Mr. Sherwin</PERSON> or <PERSON>Mr. Heyman</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Max Gitter</PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION>GAF</ORGANIZATION> defense attorney, said yesterday, "As we go in for the third time, <PERSON>Yogi Berra</PERSON>'s famous line is apt: `It's deja vu all over again. '" 
Attorneys for more than 18,000 women who claim injuries from the <LOCATION>Dalkon Shield</LOCATION> contraceptive device have asked the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> to refuse to hear an appeal of the bankruptcy-law reorganization plan for <ORGANIZATION>A.H. Robins Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which manufactured the device. 
<LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> attorney <PERSON>Michael A. Pretl</PERSON> and 17 other attorneys representing 18,136 claimants in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and abroad argue that the appeal would delay -- and perhaps even destroy -- a $2.38 billion settlement fund that is the centerpiece of the reorganization plan. 
It also bars future suits against <ORGANIZATION>Robins</ORGANIZATION> company officials, members of the <PERSON>Robins</PERSON> family and <PERSON>Robins</PERSON>'s former insurer, <ORGANIZATION>Aetna Life & Casualty Co</ORGANIZATION>.
The latter provision is "legally unprecedented," said <PERSON>Alan B. Morrison</PERSON>, a public interest lawyer in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, who is challenging the plan on behalf of 900 claimants. 
<PERSON>Robins</PERSON> has been in proceedings under Chapter 11 of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Bankruptcy Code since August 1985; such proceedings give it protection from creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan for paying its debts.
<ORGANIZATION>American Home Products Corp.</ORGANIZATION> wants to acquire <PERSON>Robins</PERSON>, but only if all legal challenges to the plan are exhausted. 
In a brief filed with the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> last week, <PERSON>Mr. Pretl</PERSON> criticizes the appeal for raising "abstract" and "theoretical" legal issues, while jeopardizing the proposed reorganization and the settlement payments to claimants. 
<PERSON>Charles A. Donohoo</PERSON>, sole proprieter of a <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>, demolition company, was found guilty of violating the Superfund law as well as the Clean Air Act. 
<PERSON>Mr. Donohoo</PERSON> was convicted in <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION> late last month of violating Superfund by failing to report the release of asbestos into the environment from a building he was demolishing.
Once {asbestos} is released into the environment, it can lodge anywhere," says <PERSON>Richard A. Dennis</PERSON>, the assistant <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney who prosecuted the case.
<PERSON>Wilmer</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Cutler & Pickering</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, law firm that spent over $1 million fighting the execution of mass-murderer <PERSON>Ted Bundy</PERSON> -- who eventually was executed -- has taken on another death penalty case before the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>, this time on the side of the family of four murder victims in <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>. 
P.J. Mode, <PERSON>Wilmer Cutler</PERSON>'s managing partner, says the trial team that represented <PERSON>Mr. Bundy</PERSON> was asked by the firm's pro bono committee whether the new case posed a conflict and that no objections were raised. 
The coupling of the law firm and the <ORGANIZATION>Washington Legal Foundation</ORGANIZATION> is odd also, because <PERSON>Wilmer Cutler</PERSON> was one of the firms singled out for criticism two years ago by the conservative legal group for displaying a liberal bias in its pro bono work. 
"We give them a lot of credit for taking this case," says <ORGANIZATION>WLF</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Alan Slobodin</PERSON>. 
THE CASE OF THE FAKE DALIS: In federal court in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, three defendants pleaded guilty to charges of fraud in connection with the sale of fake <PERSON>Salvador Dali</PERSON> lithographs.
<PERSON>James Burke</PERSON> and <PERSON>Larry Evans</PERSON>, formerly owners of the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION>Barclay Gallery</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Prudence Clark</PERSON>, a Barclay sales representative, were charged with conducting high-pressure telephone sales in which they misrepresented cheap copies of <PERSON>Dali</PERSON> artwork as signed, limited-edition lithographs.
<PERSON>Henry Pitman</PERSON>, the assistant <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney handling the case, said about 1,000 customers were defrauded and that <ORGANIZATION>Barclay</ORGANIZATION>'s total proceeds from the sales were $3.4 million.
<PERSON>Burke</PERSON> and Evans and <PERSON>Ms. Clarke</PERSON> said that although their clients admitted to making some misrepresentations in the sales, they had believed that the works were authorized by <PERSON>Mr. Dali</PERSON>, who died in January.
In trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> benchmark <ORGANIZATION>West Texas Intermediate</ORGANIZATION> crude fell 39 cents a barrel to $19.76 for December delivery.
With prices already headed lower, news of a series of explosions at a major <ORGANIZATION>Phillips Petroleum Co.</ORGANIZATION> chemical facility on the <ORGANIZATION>Houston Ship Channel</ORGANIZATION> also was bearish for prices.
According to <PERSON>Bernard Savaiko</PERSON>, senior commodity analyst at <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION>, the only stability to the market came when short sellers periodically moved in to cover their positions by buying contracts.
<PERSON>Mr. Savaiko</PERSON> noted that copper had a steep fall in spite of a weak dollar, which would normally support the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> copper market.
For the past week or so, traders have been expecting <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> to buy between 150,000 and 200,000 tons of refined sugar, and there have been expectations of a major purchase by <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
But <PERSON>Erik Dunlaevy</PERSON>, a sugar analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Balfour Maclaine International Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, said the explanation for the latest drop in sugar prices is much simpler: Speculators, he said, "got too long too soon and ran into resistance around the old contract highs." A <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION> analyst said that in light of a new estimate of a production increase of four million metric tons and only a modest increase in consumption, sugar isn't likely to rise above the top of its trading range without a crop problem in a major producing country. 
<PERSON>Sandra Kaul</PERSON>, research analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton</ORGANIZATION>, said the market pushed higher mainly in anticipation of a late harvest in the <LOCATION>Ivory Coast</LOCATION>, a major cocoa producer. 
The <LOCATION>White Plains</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, oil company said Friday that it had acquired <ORGANIZATION>Tana Production Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>TRT Energy Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, for $95.1 million in cash, with the rest to be paid in shares of a new, non-voting issue of preferred stock. 
<LOCATION>Tana</LOCATION>, which holds properties in 17 oil and gas fields in <LOCATION>south Texas</LOCATION>, will provide <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION> with mostly gas reserves.
"This acquisition is another indication of <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION>'s commitment to increase the company's reserve base," said Chief Executive Officer <PERSON>James W. Kinnear</PERSON>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION> acquired <LOCATION>Tana</LOCATION> before it completed those sales because <PERSON>Tana</PERSON>'s properties are high quality and near other fields <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION> already owns, a company spokeswoman said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION>'s situation had become particularly complex because much of its effort had for years been focused on its brawl with <ORGANIZATION>Pennzoil</ORGANIZATION> and then on <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Carl C. Icahn</PERSON>'s attempt to take over the company. 
<ORGANIZATION>Pennzoil</ORGANIZATION> had sued <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION> for improperly interfering with its acquisition of a portion of <ORGANIZATION>Getty Oil Co</ORGANIZATION>. Eventually, <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION>, which was forced into bankruptcy proceedings by that litigation, settled its fight with <ORGANIZATION>Pennzoil</ORGANIZATION> for $3 billion in 1986.
<PERSON>Mr. Icahn</PERSON>, who played a key role in the settlement and attempted subsequently to take control of the company, sold his stake in <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION> just last summer. 
Completion of <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of <LOCATION>Tana</LOCATION> is subject to government approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. 
The Canadian dollar climbed to its highest level against the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollar since late August, prompting the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Canada</ORGANIZATION> to sell the Canadian currency on the market. 
In <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Tuesday, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> currency opened for trading at 141.80 yen, down from Monday's <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> close of 142.40 yen. 
"Everyone is waiting for GNP," says <PERSON>Walter Simon</PERSON>, an assistant treasurer with <ORGANIZATION>Bank Julius Baer & Co.</ORGANIZATION> "Yet even a relatively strong number -- 2.8% to 2.9% -- won't alter the market's view that the economy is softening." 
<PERSON>Hubert Pedroli</PERSON>, managing director of foreign exchange at <ORGANIZATION>Credit Suisse</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, adds, "The market sees this as the last piece of good news." 
<PERSON>Mr. Pedroli</PERSON> notes that the GNP deflator, a measure of inflation, is expected to slow, which would give the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> more room to ease key <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> rates. 
They note that when an unexpectedly sharp widening in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade gap in August was reported earlier this month, hopes for a sustained narrowing of the trade deficit were dashed and sentiment gripped the market that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economy was losing its momentum.
On the <ORGANIZATION>Commodity Exchange</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, gold for current delivery settled at $367 an ounce, down 30 cents.
A group including <PERSON>Gene E. Phillips</PERSON>, former chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Southmark Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>William S. Friedman</PERSON>, former vice chairman of <LOCATION>Southmark</LOCATION>, lowered its stake in the <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> real estate concern to 7.7%, according to a filing with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>. 
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Pacific</ORGANIZATION> closed at $20.625, down 25 cents. 
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Pacific Realty</ORGANIZATION> is a major <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> land and building owner whose prime properties include 1,850 undeveloped acres in the <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> area, and several office sites.
Also holding two seats each on the board, they said, would be <ORGANIZATION>Olympia & York Developments Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, controlled by the <PERSON>Reichmann</PERSON> family of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Itel Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, controlled by <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> businessman <PERSON>Sam Zell</PERSON>.
The Reichmanns and <PERSON>Mr. Zell</PERSON>, the largest holders of <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Pacific</ORGANIZATION> stock, have been looking for ways to raise the value of their investments, including possible spinoffs. 
<ORGANIZATION>Itel</ORGANIZATION> bought a 17% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Sante Fe Pacific</ORGANIZATION> last year and <ORGANIZATION>Olympia & York</ORGANIZATION> later purchased about a 20% stake; they would have interests in the new realty company in line with their holdings in <ORGANIZATION>Sante Fe Pacific</ORGANIZATION>. 
But fund officials said the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Pacific Realty</ORGANIZATION> investment provides an opportunity to buy a stake in a large real estate portfolio heavily weighted with <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> properties.
In a statement late yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, <PERSON>Robert D. Krebs</PERSON>, said that <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Pacific Realty</ORGANIZATION> would repay more than $500 million in debt owed to the parent before the planned spinoff.
It wasn't clear where <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Pacific</ORGANIZATION> expected to obtain the payment of more than $500 million, which would be well above the $400 million that <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> pension fund officials say they plan to provide.
It also holds nearly 40,000 acres of raw land with development potential, but under a previously announced strategy, the company has targeted building on 5,400 acres in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> area.
Among those are the 1,850 acres in the <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> area, including 208 acres in the <LOCATION>Mission Bay</LOCATION> area. 
Fund officials negotiated the final structure of the proposed deal with <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, but they were approached with the idea by real estate brokers <ORGANIZATION>JMB Realty Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>JMB</ORGANIZATION> officials are expected to be hired to represent the pension fund on the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Pacific Realty</ORGANIZATION> board, <PERSON>Mr. Roulac</PERSON> said, to insulate the fund from potential liability problems. 
Among the 30 Dow industrials, they bought <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Procter & Gamble</ORGANIZATION> and sold <ORGANIZATION>Aluminum Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>.
Many money managers are bracing for a decline in stocks of companies with big debt loads on their balance sheets. "The junk bond market is being taken apart" because of recession fears, said <PERSON>J. David Mills</PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Boston Company Advisers</ORGANIZATION>. "Under this scrutiny, the first thing you do is sell your cyclical stocks and the second thing you do is sell your over-leveraged companies." 
In a recent investment letter entitled "Winners of the `Leverage Wars, ' " <PERSON>Edward Kerschner</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION>'s investment policy committee, suggested that investors buy stocks of companies that have avoided loading up on debt. 
He suggested that investors buy the shares of <ORGANIZATION>Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>J. Baker</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Sara Lee</PERSON>.
<ORGANIZATION>McDonald's</ORGANIZATION> has long-term debt equaling 91% of shareholder equity currently, but <PERSON>Mr. Kerschner</PERSON> said the company is carrying real estate assets at about $2.6 billion below their real value. 
<ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola</ORGANIZATION> climbed 1 3/8 to 72 1/8; <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's</ORGANIZATION> added 1 to 31 3/8, and <ORGANIZATION>Procter & Gamble</ORGANIZATION> gained 3/4 to 130 5/8.
<ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris</ORGANIZATION> slipped 1/2 to 43 7/8, while <PERSON>Sara Lee</PERSON> closed unchanged at 60 1/8. 
"Stocks that have a high default risk have started to underperform those stocks that have a lower default risk," said <PERSON>Eric Sorenson</PERSON>, director of quantitative analysis at <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers</ORGANIZATION>. "Companies that have the most exposure to the business cycle have underperformed since late last summer." 
Also, <PERSON>Exxon</PERSON> went down 3/8 to 45 3/4 and <ORGANIZATION>Allied-Signal</ORGANIZATION> lost 7/8 to 35 1/8 even though the companies' results for the quarter were in line with forecasts. 
Other weak blue-chip issues included <ORGANIZATION>Chevron</ORGANIZATION>, which went down 2 to 64 7/8 in <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> composite trading of 1.3 million shares; <ORGANIZATION>Goodyear Tire & Rubber</ORGANIZATION>, off 1 1/2 to 46 3/4, and <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>, down 3/4 to 37 1/4.
<ORGANIZATION>Pinnacle West Capital</ORGANIZATION>, whose earnings have been hurt by continued problems at its <ORGANIZATION>MeraBank</ORGANIZATION> unit, fell 1 5/8 to 9 1/8 on 2.1 million shares to lead the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s list of most active issues.
Growing pressures on the <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> real-estate market are affecting the thrift; <ORGANIZATION>Pinnacle West</ORGANIZATION> told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report it may consider filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection if it can't reach an agreement with federal regulators to provide additional capital to <ORGANIZATION>MeraBank</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities</ORGANIZATION> both lowered the stock's investment rating immediately after the results were issued Friday, according to <ORGANIZATION>PIR</ORGANIZATION>. 
Elsewhere in the chemicals sector, <ORGANIZATION>Dow Chemical</ORGANIZATION> fell 1 1/4 to 97 1/2, <ORGANIZATION>Monsanto</ORGANIZATION> lost 1 7/8 to 118, <PERSON>B.F. Goodrich</PERSON> slipped 2 1/4 to 44 3/4 and <PERSON>Olin</PERSON> slid 1 to 57 3/4.
Other stocks hurt by earnings-related selling included <ORGANIZATION>Tandy</ORGANIZATION>, which dropped 1 3/8 to 44, and <ORGANIZATION>Eaton</ORGANIZATION>, which retreated 2 1/2 to 57 1/2.
After declining about 41% last week, <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> advanced 9 7/8 to 178 3/8 on 1.1 million shares on anticipation of a revised takeover offer from a labor-management group for the parent company of <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>.
However, <ORGANIZATION>Delta Air Lines</ORGANIZATION> fell 1 1/2 to 67 1/2 and <ORGANIZATION>USAir Group</ORGANIZATION> dropped 3/4 to 42 1/2. 
<ORGANIZATION>USA Today</ORGANIZATION> reported that the <LOCATION>Rales</LOCATION> brothers, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, D.C.-based investors who made an unsuccessful offer to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Interco</ORGANIZATION> last year, have bought nearly 3% of <ORGANIZATION>Mead</ORGANIZATION>'s common shares. 
<ORGANIZATION>Paramount Communications</ORGANIZATION> rose 5/8 to 58 3/4, <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner</ORGANIZATION> climbed 1 7/8 to 138 5/8, <ORGANIZATION>Walt Disney</ORGANIZATION> advanced 3 1/8 to 127 1/2, <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> rose 1 1/8 to 65 5/8 and <ORGANIZATION>McGraw-Hill</ORGANIZATION> added 1/2 to 67 1/8. 
A series of explosions tore through the huge <ORGANIZATION>Phillips Petroleum Co.</ORGANIZATION> plastics plant near here, injuring more than a hundred and closing parts of the <ORGANIZATION>Houston Ship Channel</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <LOCATION>Bartlesville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Okla.</LOCATION>, oil company late yesterday still hadn't said officially what caused the explosions and fires, which sent columns of heavy black smoke billowing high into the air.
<PERSON>Glenn Cox</PERSON>, <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON>' president and chief operating officer, and other <LOCATION>Phillips</LOCATION> officials flew from <LOCATION>Bartlesville</LOCATION> to assess the damage and determine the cause of the afternoon explosions. 
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Phillips Petroleum</ORGANIZATION> shares fell $1.125 to $23.125. 
The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> closed six miles of the <LOCATION>Houston Ship Channel</LOCATION>, where about 150 companies have operations, because the thick, black smoke obscured the area.
<LOCATION>Nearby Pasadena</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, police reported that 104 people had been taken to area hospitals, but a spokeswoman said that toll could rise.
The <LOCATION>Costa Mesa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, maker of computer tape drives also projected record revenue for the year of $181 million, up from $122.7 million for the previous year. 
A federal judge in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> has entered a judgment requiring a <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> organized crime figure to pay the government $250,000, representing alleged profits he gained from his involvement with the <ORGANIZATION>International Brotherhood of Teamsters</ORGANIZATION>. 
<LOCATION>Manhattan U.S.</LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON>Otto Obermaier</PERSON> said it was the first time ever that the government had obtained any disgorgement from an organized crime figure indicted under the civil racketeering law. 
<PERSON>Joseph Lombardo</PERSON>, who the government alleged was the "captain" of organized crime in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, was one of numerous defendants in the government's sweeping racketeering suit against the <ORGANIZATION>Teamsters</ORGANIZATION>.
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge David Edelstein</PERSON> also permanently enjoined <PERSON>Mr. Lombardo</PERSON> from any future dealings with the Teamsters or any other labor union. 
The department distributed the revisions and clarifications to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorneys around the country this summer as part of a routine process of updating prosecutorial guidelines, <PERSON>Mr. Runkel</PERSON> said.
They argue that the rights of <ORGANIZATION>RICO</ORGANIZATION> defendants and third parties not named in <ORGANIZATION>RICO</ORGANIZATION> indictments have been unfairly damaged. 
The department's most significant clarification of existing <ORGANIZATION>RICO</ORGANIZATION> policy is a directive to prosecutors that they should seek to seize assets from defendants "in proportion" to the nature of the alleged offense, <PERSON>Mr. Runkel</PERSON> said. "That means that if the offense deals with one part of the business, you don't attempt to seize the whole business; you attempt to seize assets related to the crime," he explained. 
Also, the broker-dealer subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION>Integrated Resources Equity Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, was renamed <ORGANIZATION>Royal Alliance Associates Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Royal Alliance</ORGANIZATION>, to which the 3,900 representatives' licenses will be transferred, is a shell company <ORGANIZATION>Integrated</ORGANIZATION> owns. 
In the transaction, <ORGANIZATION>Integrated</ORGANIZATION> will transfer 100% ownership of the subsidiary to <PERSON>Gerard M. Lavin</PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Integrated</ORGANIZATION> and head of back-office operations at the subsidiary, and <PERSON>Gary W. Krat</PERSON>, executive vice president of the parent and president of the subsidiary. 
In an interview, <PERSON>Mr. Krat</PERSON> said that based on criteria yet to be determined, he expects to distribute 49% of <ORGANIZATION>Royal Alliance</ORGANIZATION> to the representatives, who sell <ORGANIZATION>Integrated</ORGANIZATION>'s insurance and mutual-fund products.
Many aspects of the agreement were worked out Wednesday in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, when Integrated senior managers met with about 150 representatives. "I think it was something that we and they thought was constructive," said <PERSON>Stephen D. Weinroth</PERSON>, chairman and co-chief executive officer of Integrated. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange Composite</ORGANIZATION> trading, <ORGANIZATION>Integrated</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at $1.125, up 12.5 cents. 
<ORGANIZATION>Property Capital</ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, had told shareholders it expected to distribute at least $21 a share, or $229 million, in a liquidation, based on an expected asset sale price of $290 million or more.
<PERSON>Ralph Brown</PERSON> was 31,000 feet over <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> when both jets on his <ORGANIZATION>Falcon</ORGANIZATION> 20 flamed out.
But knowing that mechanics would probably ground him for repairs, <PERSON>Mr. Brown</PERSON> skipped his stop in nearby <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> and set course to get his load -- a few hundred parcels -- to the Memphis package-sorting hub on time.
But he flies for <ORGANIZATION>Federal Express Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, perhaps the closest thing in corporate <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION>Green Berets</ORGANIZATION>.
This month, <ORGANIZATION>Federal</ORGANIZATION>'s 2,048 pilots, including some 961 acquired along with <ORGANIZATION>Tiger International Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in February, will decide whether to elect the powerful <ORGANIZATION>Air Line Pilots Association</ORGANIZATION> as their bargaining agent.
The election, which would bring the first major union to Federal's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> operations, has pitted new hires against devoted veterans such as <PERSON>Mr. Brown</PERSON>.
"A union, sooner or later, has to have an adversary, and it has to have a victory," <PERSON>Frederick W. Smith</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Federal</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, says with disdain. "In our formula, we don't have any losers except the competition." 
"Unions would have a profound effect on the whole culture of the company," says <ORGANIZATION>Bernard La Londe</ORGANIZATION>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State University</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Columbus</ORGANIZATION> and a Federal consultant. 
Flights are "missions." <PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON>'s managers have, at times, been called "Ho Chi Minh's Guerrillas." The <PERSON>Bravo Zulu</PERSON> award, the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> accolade for a "job well done," is bestowed on Federal's workers who surpass the call of duty.
<PERSON>James Cleveland</PERSON>, a courier who earned a <PERSON>Bravo Zulu</PERSON> for figuring out how to get a major customer's 1,100-parcel-a-week load to its doorstep by 8 a.m., considers himself far more than a courier. "We don't just hand the customer the package.
<PERSON>David Sanders</PERSON>, a longtime pilot, bristles at the mere suggestion that a union might tamper with his flight schedule. "This is <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>," he says. "Nobody has the right to tell me how much I can work." 
The operational freedom has also given Federal a leg up on archrival <ORGANIZATION>United Parcel Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest employer of <ORGANIZATION>United Brotherhood of Teamsters</ORGANIZATION> members.
Since trading as low as $42.25 a share in May, <ORGANIZATION>Federal</ORGANIZATION>'s shares have rallied as high as $57.87 in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading.
Tiger itself was founded by a band of gungho airmen who had airlifted supplies "over the Hump" from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> during World War II.
<PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON> angered <ORGANIZATION>Federal</ORGANIZATION>'s pilots, too.
In his haste to seal the deal with Tiger Chairman <PERSON>Saul Steinberg</PERSON> last August, <PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON> ignored a promise that he had made to his own pilots three years ago: that any fliers acquired in future mergers would be "end-tailed" -- put at the bottom of the pilot seniority list that determines work schedules, pay and career options.
And even some pro-union pilots say his charisma and popularity among the many former military fliers could be tough to beat. "A lot of people are identifying a vote for representation as a vote against <PERSON>Fred Smith</PERSON>," says <PERSON>J.X. Gollich</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Tiger-turned-Federal</ORGANIZATION> pilot and union activist. 
<PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON> and other top Federal executives have met with Tiger workers in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
Adds <PERSON>John Poag</PERSON>, a 727 captain and past chairman of the company-sponsored <ORGANIZATION>Flight Advisory Board</ORGANIZATION>: "They've made all these magnanimous gestures to the Flying Tiger pilots, and for us, nothing." 
<ORGANIZATION>Inco</ORGANIZATION> closed at $31.125 a share, down 62.5 cents, in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading. 
<ORGANIZATION>Inco</ORGANIZATION> said the drop in earnings resulted mainly from lower nickel prices for the period and a temporary cut in nickel output at the company's <LOCATION>Manitoba</LOCATION> operations due to high levels of arsenic in the ore. 
Just five months after <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy Group</ORGANIZATION> was swallowed up in an unsolicited takeover, <PERSON>Kenneth Roman</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, said he is leaving to take a top post at <ORGANIZATION>American Express Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Roman</PERSON>, 59 years old, abruptly announced he will leave the venerable ad agency, whose largest client is <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>, to become <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president for corporate affairs and communications.
<PERSON>Mr. Freeman</PERSON> said in August that he would retire by the end of this year to take "executive responsibility" for an embarrassing effort to discredit banker <PERSON>Edmond Safra</PERSON>.
<ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> representatives apparently influenced the publication of unfavorable articles about <PERSON>Mr. Safra</PERSON>.
Although <PERSON>Mr. Freeman</PERSON> is retiring, he will continue to work as a consultant for <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> on a project basis. 
Ad industry executives weren't surprised by <PERSON>Mr. Roman</PERSON>'s decision to leave <LOCATION>Ogilvy</LOCATION>.
The agency, under his direction, bitterly fought a takeover attempt by <ORGANIZATION>WPP Group PLC</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> before succumbing in May.
And although <PERSON>Mr. Roman</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>WPP</ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive, <PERSON>Martin Sorrell</PERSON>, have gone out of their way to be publicly supportive of each other, people close to <PERSON>Mr. Roman</PERSON> say he was unhappy giving up control of the company.
<PERSON>Mr. Roman</PERSON> will be succeeded as the head of <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy</ORGANIZATION>'s flagship ad agency, <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide</ORGANIZATION>, by <PERSON>Graham Phillips</PERSON>, 50, who had been president of North American operations and who, like <PERSON>Mr. Sorrell</PERSON>, is <LOCATION>British</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Roman</PERSON> also had overseen <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy Group</ORGANIZATION>'s two other units, the <ORGANIZATION>Scali McCabe Sloves</ORGANIZATION> advertising agency and its research division, but those units will now report directly to <ORGANIZATION>WPP</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Roman</PERSON> appears custom-made for the <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> job.
Moreover, after 26 years at <LOCATION>Ogilvy</LOCATION> he had honed a reputation for being squeaky-clean and a straight arrow -- which can only help <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> in the wake of the <LOCATION>Safra</LOCATION> incident.
He also is close to <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, <PERSON>James D. Robinson III</PERSON>. Aside from working with <PERSON>Mr. Robinson</PERSON> on the <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> advertising account for about 11 years, <PERSON>Mr. Roman</PERSON> serves on several of the same charities and boards as <PERSON>Mr. Robinson</PERSON>. 
The abrupt management change sparked widespread speculation that <PERSON>Mr. Roman</PERSON> had been pushed out of <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy</ORGANIZATION>'s top spot by <PERSON>Mr. Sorrell</PERSON>.
But <PERSON>Mr. Roman</PERSON> flatly denied the speculation, saying <PERSON>Mr. Sorrell</PERSON> had tried several times to persuade him to stay, offering various incentives and in one instance sending a note with a case of wine (The wine, naturally, was <ORGANIZATION>Seagram</ORGANIZATION>'s brand, an Ogilvy client). "He asked me not to resign.
<PERSON>Mr. Sorrell</PERSON>, traveling in the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>, couldn't be reached. 
<PERSON>Mr. Roman</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Robinson</PERSON> first approached him about the job in late September.
According to industry executives, <PERSON>Peter Sutherland</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> commissioner from <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>, was also a serious contender for the <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> job.
<PERSON>Mr. Roman</PERSON> also brushed aside reports about infighting between him and <PERSON>Mr. Phillips</PERSON>, his successor at <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Roman</PERSON> comes across as a low-key executive; <PERSON>Mr. Phillips</PERSON> has a flashier personality.
During time off, <PERSON>Mr. Roman</PERSON> tends to his garden; <PERSON>Mr. Phillips</PERSON> confesses to a fondness for, among other things, fast cars and planes.
"I'm the guy who made him head of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, head of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, president of <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, and recommended him {to <PERSON>Mr. Sorrell</PERSON>} as my successor.
He labeled reports of friction "ridiculous," and said that he spent part of the weekend on <PERSON>Mr. Phillips</PERSON>'s boat in <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Roman</PERSON> will oversee <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>'s public relations and government affairs, among other things, but he won't be involved in its advertising, which is handled by the operating units. "I consider this a second career," he said.
<PERSON>Mr. Roman</PERSON>'s departure isn't expected to have any enormous repercussions at <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Kraft General Foods</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Mattel</PERSON> executives said the move won't affect their relationships with the ad agency. "<ORGANIZATION>General Foods</ORGANIZATION>'s relationships with its agencies are based on the agencies' work, and will continue to be," said <PERSON>David Hurwitt</PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Kraft General Foods</ORGANIZATION>. 
I think they need creative leadership, and I don't think they have it," said <PERSON>Emma Hill</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Wertheim & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy & Mather</ORGANIZATION>'s top creative executive, <PERSON>Norman Berry</PERSON>, left the agency earlier this year. "<PERSON>Norm Berry</PERSON> was a creative inspiration at the company, and nobody has filled that void," said <PERSON>Ms. Hill</PERSON>. 
But other analysts said that having <PERSON>Mr. Phillips</PERSON> succeed <PERSON>Mr. Roman</PERSON> would make for a smooth transition. "<PERSON>Graham Phillips</PERSON> has been there a long time, knows the culture well, is aggressive, and apparently gets along well with" <PERSON>Mr. Sorrell</PERSON>, said <PERSON>Andrew Wallach</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert</ORGANIZATION>. "It's probably a reasonable transition.
Computer Sciences Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>El Segundo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, said it is close to making final an agreement to buy <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Consulting Associates</ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi & Saatchi 
But <PERSON>David Lord</PERSON>, managing editor of Consultants News, an industry publication based in <LOCATION>Fitzwilliam</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.H.</LOCATION>, said an industry standard would suggest a purchase price of between one and two times <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Consulting</ORGANIZATION>'s approximately $15 million annual revenue. 
Both <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi & Saatchi</ORGANIZATION>, which announced its intention to sell off most of its consulting business in June, and <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Consulting</ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on the proposed sale. 
NEW ACCOUNT: <ORGANIZATION>AmBase Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, awarded the ad account for its <ORGANIZATION>Home Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> unit to <LOCATION>Biederman</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Kelly & Shaffer</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
Billings weren't disclosed. . . . <ORGANIZATION>Puerto Rico Telephone Co.</ORGANIZATION> awarded its $3 million account to <ORGANIZATION>West Indies & Grey</ORGANIZATION>, Grey Advertising's office in <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>. 
DIET COKE: <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola Co.</ORGANIZATION> yesterday said singer <PERSON>Elton John</PERSON> signed to appear in an ad for Diet <ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. John</PERSON> becomes the latest of many music stars, including <PERSON>George Michael</PERSON> and <PERSON>Whitney Houston</PERSON>, to appear in ads for the diet drink. 
<ORGANIZATION>New Canaan Investments Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it closed the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Carr-Lowrey Glass Co.</ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION>Newell Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Freeport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, maker of do-it-yourself home products. 
<PERSON>Dana</PERSON> also said it was hurt by slumping <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> truck sales and by a strike at a parts supplier. 
The company, based in <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, had said it expected reduced third-quarter profit.
<PERSON>Mary Anne Sudol</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Fitch Investors</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said automotive suppliers were reporting lower profit almost "across the board." 
<PERSON>Southwood J. Morcott</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dana</PERSON>'s president, said the company's decision to approve its normal fourth-quarter dividend indicated its underlying strength. 
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> might stave off a crisis if it acts as forcefully as it did to arrest the 1985 decline, when <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> slammed the brakes on foreign-exchange spending and devalued the currency.
But this time, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> faces a more difficult battle because of economic forces that have come into play since the <LOCATION>Tiananmen Square</LOCATION> killings June 4. 
It's a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> crime saga worthy of an <PERSON>Erle Stanley Gardner</PERSON> title: The Case of the <ORGANIZATION>Purloined Palm Trees</ORGANIZATION>. 
Cycads, the most popular of which is the <LOCATION>Sago Palm</LOCATION>, are doll-sized versions of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s famous long-necked palms, with stubby trunks and fern-like fronds.
Because the <ORGANIZATION>Sago</ORGANIZATION> is relatively rare and grows only a couple of inches a year, it's a pricey lawn decoration: A two-foot tall <LOCATION>Sago</LOCATION> can retail for $1,000, and taller ones often fetch $3,000 or more. 
"Evidently, somebody has realized it's easy money to steal these things," says <PERSON>Loran Whitelock</PERSON>, a research associate specializing in cycads at the <LOCATION>Los Angeles State</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>County Arboretum</LOCATION>.
Just last week, would-be thieves damaged three <ORGANIZATION>Sagos</ORGANIZATION> at <PERSON>Mr. Whitelock</PERSON>'s home in the <LOCATION>Eagle Rock</LOCATION> section before something frightened them off, foiled. "It's hard to think someone is raping your garden," he says. 
Thieves are going to find "anybody who has enough bucks to plant these things in their front yard," says <PERSON>William Morrissey</PERSON>, an investigator with the police department in <LOCATION>Garden Grove</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, where five such thefts have been reported in the past several weeks.
<ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's board quashed any prospects for an immediate revival of a labor-management buy-out, saying <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>' parent should remain independent for now. 
As a result, <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, <PERSON>Stephen M. Wolf</PERSON>, pulled out of the buy-out effort to focus on running the company. 
<ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>, which had risen $9.875 to $178.375 in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> on reports of a new bid being prepared by the group, reversed course and plummeted in off-exchange trading after the 5:09 p.m. <ORGANIZATION>EDT</ORGANIZATION> announcement. 
Among the first trades reported by the securities firm of <ORGANIZATION>Jefferies & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which makes a market in <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> after the exchange is closed, were 10,000 shares at $170, 6,000 shares at $162, 2,500 at $162, and 10,000 at $158. 
Twelve of <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>'s outside directors met at a five-hour meeting yesterday in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> to consider an informal proposal from the buy-out group for a revised bid.
As a "good-will measure," the pilots had been working four extra hours a month and had agreed to fly <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>'s two new <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> 747-400 aircraft.
Until the collapse of this bid, <PERSON>Mr. Wolf</PERSON> was regarded as one of the nation's savviest airline executives after engineering turnarounds of <ORGANIZATION>Tiger International Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Republic Airlines</ORGANIZATION>. 
But he and his chief financial officer, <PERSON>John Pope</PERSON>, sowed some of the seeds for the deal's failure by insisting banks accept low financing fees and interest rates, while they invested in the transaction only a small fraction of the $114.3 million they stood to gain from sale of their <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stock and options. 
<LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON>, whose $240-a-share offer for <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> in August triggered a bidding war, says he remains interested in the airline.
Yesterday, in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Vermont American</ORGANIZATION> common closed at $39.75, off 25 cents. 
The <ORGANIZATION>FTC</ORGANIZATION>'s request was "not unusual" and <ORGANIZATION>Emerson</ORGANIZATION> will make a "full and prompt" response, according to a spokesman.
Spokesmen for <ORGANIZATION>Emerson</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Vermont American</LOCATION>, which has agreed to be acquired, said they don't anticipate "any problems" with the completion of the transaction. 
<ORGANIZATION>Emerson</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Bosch</ORGANIZATION>, through their joint acquisition arm, <ORGANIZATION>Maple Acquisition</ORGANIZATION>, have begun a cash tender offer for all of <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>'s common shares outstanding.
St. Louis-based <ORGANIZATION>Emerson</ORGANIZATION> and Stuttgart-based <ORGANIZATION>Bosch</ORGANIZATION> make electrical and electronic products, including power tools.
<ORGANIZATION>Cummins Engine Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION>, hurt by a drop in engine orders from heavy-truck makers, reported a third-quarter loss of $39.7 million, or $4.12 a share, on essentially flat sales of $807.6 million. 
Although <ORGANIZATION>Cummins</ORGANIZATION>'s stock stumbled last month after the company projected a "substantial" third-period loss, the stock also fell $1.125 in composite <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> trading yesterday, to $51.75.
<ORGANIZATION>Exxon Corp.</ORGANIZATION> filed suit against the state of <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, charging state officials interfered with the oil company's initial efforts to treat last spring's giant oil spill. 
The action is a counterclaim to a suit filed by <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> in August against <ORGANIZATION>Exxon</ORGANIZATION> and six other oil companies.
The state's suit alleges that <ORGANIZATION>Exxon</ORGANIZATION>'s response to the spill failed to prevent contamination of hundreds of miles of shoreline along Prince <PERSON>William Sound</PERSON>.
That suit and <ORGANIZATION>Exxon</ORGANIZATION>'s countersuit were filed in a state court in <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Craig Tillery</PERSON>, an <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> assistant attorney general, said in an interview last night that <PERSON>Exxon</PERSON>'s accusations "are not new.
The oil company claims that it had permission from the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION> prior to the spill to use dispersant during such an incident at the discretion of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION>.
The state's opposition to the use of dispersants, <PERSON>Exxon</PERSON> says, caused the <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> "to delay granting permission." 
<LOCATION>Alaskan</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> officials say <ORGANIZATION>Exxon</ORGANIZATION>'s charges aren't relevant because tests conducted during the first two days following the spill showed that the dispersant wasn't working anyway.
Behind second-place <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley</ORGANIZATION> were <ORGANIZATION>Kidder, Peabody & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>CS First Boston Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp.</ORGANIZATION> unit. 
An <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> representative said that the <LOCATION>Guadalajara</LOCATION> factory will make a full line of answering machines.
<ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> already has a factory in <LOCATION>Matamoros</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, to make electrical devices.
<ORGANIZATION>Meson Investment Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION>, B.C.-based investment firm, said it raised its stake in <ORGANIZATION>Verit Industries</ORGANIZATION> to 8.9% of the common shares outstanding. 
In a <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> filing, <PERSON>Meson</PERSON> said it holds 67,400 Verit common shares, including net purchases of 8,100 shares bought from Oct. 10, 1988, to Oct. 11, 1989, for $3.875 to $7 each. 
<PERSON>Meson</PERSON> is the personal holding company of <PERSON>Steven Morfey</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION> securities dealer.
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Verit</ORGANIZATION> closed unchanged yesterday at $3.875 a share. 
BRISTOL-MYERS <ORGANIZATION>SQUIBB Co.</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>) -- <PERSON>Gerald C. Beddall</PERSON>, 47 years old, was named president of the <ORGANIZATION>Clairol</ORGANIZATION> division of this pharmaceuticals and health-care company.
<ORGANIZATION>Clairol</ORGANIZATION>, which makes hair and skin products, was a division of <ORGANIZATION>Bristol-Myers Co.</ORGANIZATION> before that company's merger with <ORGANIZATION>Squibb Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>House Appropriations Committee</ORGANIZATION> approved an estimated $2.85 billion in emergency funding to assist <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s recovery from last week's earthquake and to extend further aid to <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> victims of Hurricane Hugo. 
The package was termed excessive by the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration, but it also provoked a struggle with influential <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> lawmakers who sought unsuccessfully to add nearly $1 billion more and waive current restrictions to expedite the distribution of funds. 
By a 26-7 margin, the committee scuttled the more expensive alternative, and the debate forced a strained confrontation between <ORGANIZATION>Appropriations Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Jamie Whitten</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Miss.</LOCATION>) and his party's largest state delegation in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>. 
"I have no regrets about going forward," said Rep. <PERSON>Vic Fazio</PERSON> (D.,<LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>), who sought later to play down the sometimes hostile tone of the long evening meeting. "We are the Golden State," <PERSON>Mr. Fazio</PERSON> said, "and there is a certain amount of jealousy." 
The measure is expected to come before the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> today, and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> is under pressure to complete action before midnight EDT tomorrow, when the current continuing resolution expires. 
<LOCATION>Given California</LOCATION>'s size and political importance, the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> is eager to appear generous.
A <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> budget office analysis estimates that $500 million -- or half the level in the committee bill -- is needed for highway assistance to meet <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s needs, and the administration rejects the notion that new appropriations are needed to finance disaster loans by the <ORGANIZATION>Small Business Administration</ORGANIZATION>. 
"Everybody appreciates that it is a national disaster and that we've got to address it," said <PERSON>Mr. Darman</PERSON>, who came to the Capitol to meet with <PERSON>Mr. Whitten</PERSON> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> lawmakers before the committee session. "I would hope very much that we wouldn't end up in a kind of situation where you have a bidding war and then a veto threat." 
Although this <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> pressure was clearly a factor among committee Republicans, no single influence was greater than <PERSON>Mr. Whitten</PERSON>.
When <PERSON>Mr. Fazio</PERSON> offered the California-backed $3.84 billion plan, <PERSON>Mr. Whitten</PERSON> insisted that the full 14 pages be read aloud by the panel's clerk to underscore the range of legislative changes also sought by the delegation.
On the chairman's motion, the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> package was subsequently reduced to less-binding report language, and even when this was accepted as such on a voice vote, <PERSON>Mr. Whitten</PERSON> pointedly opposed it. 
A member in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> leadership and skilled legislator, <PERSON>Mr. Fazio</PERSON> nonetheless found himself burdened not only by <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s needs but by Hurricane Hugo amendments he accepted in a vain effort to build support in the panel.
The <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Democrat appeared embarrassed by provisions inserted on behalf of owners of private beaches in the <LOCATION>Virgin Islands</LOCATION>, and lumber interests sought to add another $100 million in federal aid to plant timber on private land in <LOCATION>North</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Randolph W. McElroy</PERSON>, a vice chairman of this bank-holding company, was named to the additional position of chairman of its principal unit, <ORGANIZATION>Sovran Bank</ORGANIZATION>.
Sovran also named <PERSON>John B. Werner</PERSON> a vice chairman of the parent company and the unit and elected him to the newly created position of chief credit officer of <ORGANIZATION>Sovran Financial</ORGANIZATION>, increasing the number of corporate board members to 35.
<ORGANIZATION>Rhone-Poulenc S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, said it completed the purchase of the specialty chemicals operation of <ORGANIZATION>RTZ Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a British mining and industrial group. 
Consumer spending in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> rose 0.1% in the third quarter from the second quarter and was up 3.8% from a year ago, the <ORGANIZATION>Central Statistical Office</ORGANIZATION> estimated Friday. 
The 67-year-old maker of brassieres, panties, and lingerie enjoys one of the best-known brand images, but its financial profile is closely guarded by members of the founding family. "There are very few companies that can boast of such a close-knit group," says <PERSON>Robert A. Brawer</PERSON>, 52 years old, recently named president, succeeding <PERSON>Beatrice Coleman</PERSON>, his mother-in-law, who remains chairman. "We are a vanishing breed," he muses. 
<PERSON>Mrs. Coleman</PERSON>, 73, who declined to be interviewed, is the <LOCATION>Maidenform</LOCATION> strategist.
Its current ad campaign, on which <PERSON>Maidenform</PERSON> has spent more than $15 million since fall 1987, doesn't even show its underwear products, but rather men like <PERSON>Christopher Reeve</PERSON>, star of the "Superman" movies, talking about their lingerie turn-ons. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Maidenform</ORGANIZATION> name "is part of <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> pop culture," says <PERSON>Joan Sinopoli</PERSON>, account supervisor of the campaign by <PERSON>Levine</PERSON>, <PERSON>Huntley</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Schmidt & Beaver</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> ad firm.
"Capitalizing on the brand is key," says <PERSON>Mr. Brawer</PERSON>, whose immediate plans include further international expansion and getting better control of distribution outside the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
"The intimate apparel industry is perceived to be a growth industry and clearly {<PERSON>Maidenform</PERSON>} is a force to be reckoned with," says <PERSON>David S. Leibowitz</PERSON>, a special situations analyst at <ORGANIZATION>American Securities Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
Although <PERSON>Mr. Brawer</PERSON>'s appointment as president was long expected, the move on Sept. 25 precipitated the resignation of <PERSON>Alan Lesk</PERSON> as senior vice president of sales and merchandising.
Three days later, <PERSON>Mr. Lesk</PERSON> was named president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Olga Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a competing intimate apparel division of <ORGANIZATION>Warnaco Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Warnaco</ORGANIZATION> also owns <ORGANIZATION>Warners</ORGANIZATION>, another major intimate apparel maker. 
But <ORGANIZATION>Maidenform</ORGANIZATION> officials say that after spending 24 years at <LOCATION>Maidenform</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Lesk</PERSON>, 48, made it clear he wanted the top job. "If you want the presidency of the company, this isn't the firm to work for," says <PERSON>James Mogan</PERSON>, 45, who was named senior vice president of sales, assuming some of the responsibilities of <PERSON>Mr. Lesk</PERSON>. 
The company downplayed the loss of <PERSON>Mr. Lesk</PERSON> and split his merchandising responsibilities among a committee of four people. "My style is less informal," <PERSON>Mr. Brawer</PERSON> says. 
Top officers insist <ORGANIZATION>Maidenform</ORGANIZATION>'s greatest strength is its family ownership. "You can't go anywhere in this company and find an organizational chart," one delights. "It is fun competing as a private company," <PERSON>Mr. Brawer</PERSON> says. "You can think long range." 
<ORGANIZATION>Warnaco</ORGANIZATION> was taken private by <ORGANIZATION>Spectrum Group</ORGANIZATION> in 1986 for about $487 million.
It was then split into <ORGANIZATION>Playtex Apparel Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the intimate apparel division, and <ORGANIZATION>Playtex Family Products Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which makes tampons, hair-care items and other products.
Publicly traded <ORGANIZATION>VF Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION>Vanity Fair</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Sara Lee Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION>Bali Co.</ORGANIZATION>, are also strong forces in intimate apparel. 
When he gets calls, "I don't even have to consult" with <PERSON>Mrs. Coleman</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Masket</PERSON> says. 
The company could command a good price in the market. "Over the past three and a half years, apparel companies, many of whom have strong brand names, have been bought at about 60% of sales," says <PERSON>Deborah Bronston</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ORGANIZATION> apparel analyst. 
<PERSON>Mr. Brawer</PERSON>, along with <PERSON>Mrs. Coleman</PERSON> and her daughter, <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON>, an attorney who is vice chairman, are the family members involved in the operations of <LOCATION>Maidenform</LOCATION>, which employs about 5,000.
<PERSON>Mr. Brawer</PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON>Catherine</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Robert Stroup</PERSON>, <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON>'s husband, round out the five-member board.
While <PERSON>Mr. Rosenthal</PERSON> introduced new undergarment designs, his wife, <PERSON>Ida</PERSON>, concentrated on sales and other financial matters.
The name <PERSON>Maidenform</PERSON> was coined by a third business partner, <PERSON>Enid Bissett</PERSON>. 
The company has 14 plants and distribution facilities in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, other parts of the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>. 
Maidenform products are mainly sold at department stores, but the company has quietly opened a retail store of its own in <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neb.</LOCATION>, and has 24 factory outlets, with plans to add more. 
Before joining <ORGANIZATION>Maidenform</ORGANIZATION> in 1972, <PERSON>Mr. Brawer</PERSON>, who holds a doctoral degree in English from the <ORGANIZATION>University of Chicago</ORGANIZATION>, taught at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Wisconsin</ORGANIZATION>.
While the company has always been family-run, <PERSON>Mr. Brawer</PERSON> isn't the first person to marry into the family and subsequently head <PERSON>Maidenform</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mrs. Coleman</PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON>, a physician, succeeded <PERSON>Mrs. Rosenthal</PERSON> as president and served in that post until his death in 1968. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> convicted <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Alcee Hastings</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> of eight impeachment articles, removing the 53-year-old judge from his $89,500-a-year, lifetime job. 
In 1983, <PERSON>Mr. Hastings</PERSON> was found not guilty of accepting a $150,000 bribe in a case before him, the central charge on which the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> convicted him.
With no floor debate, the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> on Friday voted 69-26 to convict <PERSON>Mr. Hastings</PERSON> of perjury and conspiring to accept a bribe, five votes more than needed.
Although <PERSON>Mr. Hastings</PERSON> had been acquitted by a jury, lawmakers handling the prosecution in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> had argued that the purpose of impeachment isn't to punish an individual.
<PERSON>Mr. Hastings</PERSON> was appointed to the federal bench by President <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> in 1979 and was one of the few black federal judges in the country.
Following the impeachment conviction, <PERSON>Dr. Benjamin Hooks</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</ORGANIZATION>, issued a restrained statement, warning that the <PERSON>Hastings</PERSON> case could set a "dangerous precedent," but adding, "We must respect the considered judgment of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>." 
<ORGANIZATION>Detrex Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said a reserve it is establishing to cover expected pollution cleanup costs at an <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> plant reduced its third-quarter net income by $1.9 million. 
In addition, the manufacturer said it signed a consent decree with <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> to build a $1.4 million pollution-control facility at the <LOCATION>Ashtabula</LOCATION> chemical manufacturing plant by Aug. 1, 1990. 
<ORGANIZATION>Detrex</ORGANIZATION> said it is one of at least 17 companies notified by the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION> that they may be potentially responsible for cleaning up the <ORGANIZATION>Fields Brook</ORGANIZATION> watershed near <LOCATION>Detrex</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Ashtabula</LOCATION> plant at a total cost the <ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION> estimates at $48 million -- a figure <ORGANIZATION>Detrex</ORGANIZATION> said the companies dispute. 
<PERSON>Jim Farooquee</PERSON>, chief executive officer of the <LOCATION>Tustin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, computer accessories supplier, said he was "comfortable" with analysts' expectations that CMS would earn between six cents and eight cents a share on revenue of about $42 million. 
<PERSON>Morton Downey Jr.</PERSON>, who self-destructed as a talk-show host and frequently verbally abused his guests, has been signed to co-host a half-hour nightly program on the Consumer News and Business Channel, the cable channel partly owned by the <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>National Broadcasting Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
The premiere of "Showdown," with <PERSON>Mr. Downey</PERSON> and <PERSON>Richard G. Carter</PERSON>, a columnist with the <ORGANIZATION>New York Daily News</ORGANIZATION>, is scheduled for Dec. 4 at 8 p.m. CNBC is available to 13 million cable households. 
<PERSON>Michael Eskridge</PERSON>, president of CNBC, said that although there will be a studio audience, viewers will no longer have to endure the shouting of "Mort! Mort! Mort!" But just how does <PERSON>Mr. Downey</PERSON>'s unorthodox style mesh with the sedate tone of <ORGANIZATION>CNBC</ORGANIZATION>'s business programming? 
"Ninety percent of <LOCATION>Mort</LOCATION>'s old show fits into our style," said <PERSON>Mr. Eskridge</PERSON>. "That is consumer issues." 
<PERSON>Mr. Downey</PERSON>'s previous show, a one-hour shout fest, syndciated by <ORGANIZATION>MCA Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and produced by <ORGANIZATION>Quantum Media Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, was canceled in July after advertisers and stations abandoned it. 
<ORGANIZATION>Phillips Petroleum Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Atlantic Richfield Co.</ORGANIZATION> also reported declines in quarterly profit, while <ORGANIZATION>Ashland Oil Inc.</ORGANIZATION> posted a loss for the latest quarter.
<ORGANIZATION>Amerada Hess Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Occidental Petroleum Corp.</ORGANIZATION> reported higher earnings. 
Although crude oil prices were significantly higher this year, they weren't strong enough to offset the declining profits in those business sectors at most oil companies, said <PERSON>William Randol</PERSON>, oil analyst for <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
He estimates that the price of <ORGANIZATION>West Texas Intermediate</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> benchmark crude, was $4.04 a barrel higher during the third quarter of this year than in the same period last year. 
The <LOCATION>Ashland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>, oil company reported a $38 million charge resulting from settlement of a 10-year dispute with the <ORGANIZATION>National Iranian Oil Co.</ORGANIZATION> over claims that <LOCATION>Ashland</LOCATION> didn't pay for Iranian crude it had received.
In September, <LOCATION>Ashland</LOCATION> settled the long-simmering dispute by agreeing to pay <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> $325 million. 
<ORGANIZATION>Hess</ORGANIZATION>'s earnings were up despite a $30 million charge to cover the cost of maintaining operations after Hurricane Hugo heavily damaged the company's refinery at <LOCATION>St. Croix</LOCATION>.
Despite higher oil prices, exploration and production profits were off because of foreign-currency losses and some construction costs incurred in one of <LOCATION>Phillips</LOCATION>' <LOCATION>North Sea</LOCATION> oil fields.
<ORGANIZATION>Arco</ORGANIZATION>'s earnings from its 49.9% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Lyondell</ORGANIZATION> fell to $37 million from $156 million for the same period last year, when <ORGANIZATION>Lyondell</ORGANIZATION> was wholly owned.
<ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> said that once it receives the go-ahead from <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> stock market authorities, it will offer to boost its <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> stake to 66.7% from the current 18.7%.
Its cash-or-shares bid values <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> at about 22.82 billion francs ($3.62 billion), making this one of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s largest-ever attempted takeovers.
The move would greatly boost <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION>'s stake in the insurance, transport and food businesses, where <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> is strong.
It also would make <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> a major French ally of <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Allianz AG insurance group</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Allianz</ORGANIZATION> holds a 50% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION>'s insurance interests, acquired three weeks ago.
Long considered a potential takeover target, <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> had hoped <PERSON>Allianz</PERSON> would help protect it from raiders.
<ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> is <PERSON>Allianz</PERSON>'s main French bank, and the Munich-based group said it intends to stay neutral.
But <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> is loosely held and hard to defend. "The defensive options are limited," says <PERSON>Philippe Braye</PERSON>, a partner in portfolio management concern <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> Finance Quatre. "Who would bid against <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION>?" 
Moreover, <PERSON>Suez</PERSON> had just finished winning an even larger battle last year for control of <ORGANIZATION>Societe Generale de Belgique</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> officials, once considered <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s toughest bankers, felt abashed at Suez's success and its rapid growth.
Although <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> denies it, analysts say the new bid in part simply reflects the continuing rivalry between <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s two largest investment banking groups. 
It also reflects the broader pressure on companies in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> to keep up as the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> prepares to reduce internal trade barriers by 1992.
Although <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Michel Francois-Poncet</PERSON> wouldn't rule out eventually selling all of <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION>'s insurance operations to <ORGANIZATION>Allianz</ORGANIZATION>, he stressed the potential for the two groups instead to cooperate. 
<ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> said it will bid 1,850 francs a share for <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> shares that qualify for a full yearly dividend, and 1,800 francs for those created July 1, which are eligible for partial dividends.
Alternatively, it said it would offer three <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> shares, themselves eligible for dividends as of next Jan. 1, for one <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> share.
<ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> shares closed down 30 francs at 610 francs, and <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> shares were suspended at 1,800 francs pending the outcome of the bid. 
When notoriously independent-minded <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Marc Fournier</PERSON> rejected <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION>'s offer and began buying <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> shares in retaliation, <PERSON>Mr. Francois-Poncet</PERSON> said, he felt obliged to bid for control.
He told reporters he had information that <PERSON>Mr. Fournier</PERSON> was preparing to buy as much as 20% of <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION>, up from less than 5% currently. 
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s second-largest government-owned insurance company, <ORGANIZATION>Assurances Generales de France</ORGANIZATION>, has been building its own <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> stake, currently thought to be between 8% and 10%.
Remaining units will be sold to the underwriters, <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Kidder, Peabody & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which will also purchase an over-allotment of 2.3 million additional units. 
SHEVARDNADZE ADMITTED that <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> violated the 1972 <ORGANIZATION>ABM</ORGANIZATION> treaty. 
<PERSON>Shevardnadze</PERSON> said it took <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>'s government four years to determine that the station's location in <LOCATION>Siberia</LOCATION> violated the accord, as Western arms-control officials have long contended.
He also denounced <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>'s nine-year involvement in the war in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>, saying it involved "gross violations of . . . civil norms and ethics." 
Secretary of <ORGANIZATION>State Baker</ORGANIZATION>, in his first major arms-control speech, called for a new military relationship with <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> to reduce "first strike" nuclear arms. 
The <ORGANIZATION>House Appropriations Committee</ORGANIZATION> approved a $2.85 billion aid package for the quake region, less than the $3.8 billion sought by <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> officials. 
<LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> declared itself a democracy and for the first time openly commemorated the anniversary of the 1956 anti-Stalinist uprising that was crushed by the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
A crowd estimated at 100,000 held a torch-lit march through <LOCATION>Budapest</LOCATION> as Acting President <PERSON>Szuros</PERSON> delivered a nationally televised address rejecting communist dominance. 
The space shuttle <LOCATION>Atlantis</LOCATION> landed at a desert air strip at <ORGANIZATION>Edwards Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, ending a five-day mission that dispatched the Jupiter-bound <PERSON>Galileo</PERSON> space probe.
Explosions shook a <ORGANIZATION>Phillips Petroleum Co.</ORGANIZATION> plastics plant near <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, hurling debris and causing a fire visible from 10 miles away.
The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is conferring with leaders of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Intelligence Committee</ORGANIZATION> to ease differences over guidelines for <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> agents.
The statement came after officials said <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> complained at a private meeting last week that a strict interpretation of a policy requires the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> to notify foreign dictators of certain coup plots. 
<LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>'s Gen. Aoun placed Christian military forces on alert in case of renewed fighting with Syrian-backed Moslems after <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>'s two main <ORGANIZATION>Shiite</ORGANIZATION> militias rejected an Arab-sponsored peace accord.
<ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> defense ministers are expected to call for a reduction in nuclear forces in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> when the alliance's nuclear planning group convenes a two-day session today in <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>.
The ministers are to reshape <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION>'s defenses in <LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION> amid fast-paced changes in the Soviet bloc. 
<LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s President <PERSON>Rafsanjani</PERSON> offered to help gain freedom for Western hostages in <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>, but said the assistance was contingent on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> aid in resolving the cases of three Iranians kidnapped in <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION> in 1982 or the release of frozen Iranian assets.
<ORGANIZATION>PLO</ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON>Arafat</PERSON> asked <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> to seek clarifications from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> on Secretary of <ORGANIZATION>State Baker</ORGANIZATION>'s plan for <LOCATION>Mideast</LOCATION> peace talks, an aide to <LOCATION>Egyptian</LOCATION> President <PERSON>Mubarak</PERSON> said.
<ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> leaders turned to issues ranging from drugs to the world economy after <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>'s President <PERSON>Mugabe</PERSON> called <PERSON>Thatcher</PERSON>'s views on <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> "despicable." At a meeting in <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> also assailed the <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> prime minister for criticizing the 49-nation group's call for <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION> to ease apartheid. 
<ORGANIZATION>Cray Research Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it sold one of its newest and largest computer systems, the Cray Y-MP/832, to the <ORGANIZATION>United Kingdom Meteorological Office</ORGANIZATION>.
The system is the first to be sold through the joint marketing agreement between <ORGANIZATION>Cray</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Control Data Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
The supercomputer, which lists for $18.5 million, will be installed in the first quarter of 1990 in the meteorological office's headquarters in <LOCATION>Bracknell</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>. 
We've heard <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s property-tax-cutting Proposition 13 blamed for a lot over the years, but <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Ted Koppel</PERSON> came up with a new wrinkle in his earthquake coverage last week when he asked Democratic <PERSON>Assemblyman Richard Katz</PERSON> if Prop. 13 had withheld money needed for road maintenance.
<PERSON>Mr. Katz</PERSON> happily agreed, sliding over the fact that <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s roads and bridges aren't funded by property taxes but by state and federal gasoline taxes.
<ORGANIZATION>Kurzweil Music Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it retained <ORGANIZATION>Kidder, Peabody & Co.</ORGANIZATION> to study financial alternatives, including the possible sale of the financially struggling company. 
Kurzweil, <LOCATION>Waltham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, makes digital electronic keyboard instruments used by professional recording musicians.
Last month its president, <PERSON>John S. Donnelly</PERSON>, resigned citing "management differences" with <PERSON>Mr. Kurzweil</PERSON>. 
The move also helps the <LOCATION>Rochester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, photographic giant ensure that its motion-picture film business -- for which it holds a virtual monopoly, supplying every <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> movie company -- isn't made obsolete by the upstart <ORGANIZATION>HDTV</ORGANIZATION> business. 
"The industry has been waiting with bated breath for the machines to come along," says <PERSON>David Niles</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Eleven Twenty Five Productions Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> pioneer in high-definition programming.
Japanese electronic giants, such as <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Hitachi Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, have focused almost entirely on <ORGANIZATION>HDTV</ORGANIZATION> hardware, and virtually ignored software or programs shot in high-definition.
It would be like "watching a black and white movie on a color TV set," says <PERSON>Malcolm G. Saull</PERSON>, chairman of the film and video department at the <ORGANIZATION>Rochester Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>. 
The new converters are "a critical link between film and the television domain," says <PERSON>Joerg D. Agin</PERSON>, vice president and general manager of <ORGANIZATION>Kodak's Motion Picture</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Audiovisual Products</ORGANIZATION> division. 
A similar machine already on the market, made by <ORGANIZATION>Rank Sintel Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Rank Organisation</ORGANIZATION>, costs about $500,000. 
If <ORGANIZATION>HDTV</ORGANIZATION> takes off in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, there will be demand for some 4,000 to 5,000 HDTV converters, known in the industry as telecines.
"The converter is head and shoulders above anything else I've seen," says <PERSON>Richard J. Stumpf</PERSON>, vice president-engineering and development at <ORGANIZATION>MCA Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Universal City Studios</ORGANIZATION>.
And <PERSON>Mr. Niles</PERSON>, the program producer, contends that <PERSON>Kodak</PERSON>'s move is "a sound marketing decision.
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> electronics industry estimates that the <ORGANIZATION>HDTV</ORGANIZATION> market will total about $150 billion over the next two decades, with an additional $400 billion expected to go for related products. 
Nevertheless, <PERSON>Kodak</PERSON> couldn't risk letting HDTV turn its motion-picture film business into a dinosaur. "Kodak understands <ORGANIZATION>HDTV</ORGANIZATION> is where everybody is going," says <ORGANIZATION>RIT</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Spaull</PERSON>. 
<LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION>, Va.-based <ORGANIZATION>Legent</ORGANIZATION> said it expects to post revenue for the quarter of more than $31 million, compared with pro forma revenue of $25.2 million in 1988. 
For the fiscal year, the company said it anticipates reporting earnings of $23 million, or about $1.15 a share, including a charge of about $5.9 million, or 22 cents a share, related to the merger that created Legent out of <ORGANIZATION>Duquesne Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Morino Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in March 1989.
<ORGANIZATION>Qintex Australia Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a media and resorts concern controlled by Australian entrepreneur <PERSON>Christopher Skase</PERSON>, announced a plan to restructure and sell assets to try to ease its financial problems. 
<PERSON>Mr. Skase</PERSON>, a 41-year-old former newspaper reporter who chairs the company, said in a statement that <ORGANIZATION>Qintex</ORGANIZATION> will sell its 51% stake in its upscale Mirage resorts in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> as well as three Australian television stations. 
<PERSON>Mr. Skase</PERSON> also said the restructuring plan calls for the merger of <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Australia</ORGANIZATION> with <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, which owns 55% of <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Australia</ORGANIZATION>.
Company officials said over the weekend that <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Australia</ORGANIZATION>'s bank creditors have become concerned about a barrage of bad news at the company, including a failed US$1.5 billion plan to buy <ORGANIZATION>MGM/UA Communications Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, movie and television production concern. 
Friday, <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Entertainment Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a 43%-owned <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> affiliate, filed for protection from creditor lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Bankruptcy Code.
The company's latest moves were disclosed after the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> suspended trading in shares of <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Australia</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> because the companies hadn't answered an exchange inquiry about the extent of their loans, investments and deposits at <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Entertainment</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Qintex Australia</ORGANIZATION> also said it has an investment of A$83.3 million in <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Entertainment</ORGANIZATION> shares. 
In the statement, <PERSON>Mr. Skase</PERSON> said that on the basis of current interest rates in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, the company's asset sales would reduce interest expense by about A$120 million a year in addition to eliminating certain liabilities. 
In March, <ORGANIZATION>Qintex</ORGANIZATION> sold 49% of the three Mirage resorts to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Nippon Shinpan Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mitsui & Co.</ORGANIZATION> for A$433 million.
Before its shares were suspended from trading, <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Australia</ORGANIZATION> plunged to 16 Australian cents (12 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> cents) a share yesterday from 33 Australian cents Friday.
They were what he called an "unlawful termination" by MGM/UA of the acquisition agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Qintex</ORGANIZATION>, high Australian interest rates, a pilots' strike at Australian domestic airlines that cut revenue at the company's Australian resorts and delays in completing a sale of two regional TV stations in <LOCATION>Queensland</LOCATION> state.
MGM/UA has sued <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Australia</ORGANIZATION> for breach of contract and fraud over the collapsed acquisition agreement, and <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Australia</ORGANIZATION> has threatened a countersuit. 
<PERSON>Mr. Skase</PERSON> also disclosed a disagreement among directors of <LOCATION>Qintex Australia</LOCATION> over certain fees claimed by <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Group Management Services Pty.</ORGANIZATION>, a management-services concern in which <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Australia</ORGANIZATION> executives have an interest. 
<ORGANIZATION>Amtech Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Tempe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, said its preliminary year-end results of operations indicate "substantial improvement" over the previous fiscal year. 
<ORGANIZATION>Amtech</ORGANIZATION>, which also provides technical temporary employment services to aerospace, defense, computer and high-tech companies in the <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Baltimore-Washington</LOCATION> areas, said its final audited results are due in late November. 
The company attributed the improvement to strong demand in the semiconductor equipment segment as well as the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Echelon Service Co.</ORGANIZATION> and the inclusion of a full year's results of operations for <ORGANIZATION>RTS Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, compared with seven months' results for the prior year. 
When <PERSON>Robert McDuffie</PERSON> was 14, he got a chance to play in the starting lineup for his high school basketball team in <LOCATION>Macon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga</LOCATION>.
Unfortunately, his mother had tickets for a recital by <PERSON>Itzhak Perlman</PERSON> the same night, and she was adamant about his attending. "I threw such a fit," says <PERSON>Mr. McDuffie</PERSON>, who had begun violin studies at the age of six. "But once <PERSON>Perlman</PERSON> started playing, I didn't give a damn about basketball. . . . Afterwards, I went home and practiced for three hours." 
He's currently in the midst of a 17-city <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> tour with <PERSON>Yehudi Menuhin</PERSON> and the <LOCATION>Warsaw Sinfonia</LOCATION>, with stops including <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION> (Oct. 25), <LOCATION>Sarasota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION> (Oct. 28), <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION> (Oct. 29) and <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> (Oct. 31).
Later this season he gives a recital at <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Center</ORGANIZATION>, and appears as soloist with several major orchestras. 
During the late 1970s, he was part of a musical "brat pack" -- a group of budding virtuosos who studied at the <ORGANIZATION>Juilliard School</ORGANIZATION> with the noted pedagogue <PERSON>Dorothy DeLay</PERSON>.
His violin classmates included <PERSON>Shlomo Mintz</PERSON>, a protege of <ORGANIZATION>Isaac Stern</ORGANIZATION> who performed with major orchestras while still a student; <PERSON>Cho-Liang Lin</PERSON>, who joined the roster of <ORGANIZATION>ICM Artists Inc.</ORGANIZATION> at the age of 18; and <PERSON>Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg</PERSON>, who launched her career by winning the 1981 <ORGANIZATION>Naumberg Competition</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Young McDuffie</PERSON>'s first violin teacher was <PERSON>Henrik Schwarzenberger</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Hungarian</LOCATION> refugee who taught in the <LOCATION>Macon</LOCATION> public school system. "He taught me how to play like a gypsy," jokes the musician. "I didn't learn to count until I got to <PERSON>Juilliard</PERSON>." After studies at that conservatory's Pre-College Division with an assistant to the legendary instructor <PERSON>Ivan Galamian</PERSON>, he switched at the college level to Miss DeLay, <PERSON>Mr. Galamian</PERSON>'s longtime assistant and, ultimately, his rival. "I think I had to prove myself to her," says <PERSON>Mr. McDuffie</PERSON>. "But she was always encouraging.
It was also at Juilliard that <PERSON>Mr. McDuffie</PERSON> discovered his predilection for conservative, 20th-century American composers such as <PERSON>David Diamond</PERSON> and <PERSON>Samuel Barber</PERSON>.
Since leaving <ORGANIZATION>Juilliard</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. McDuffie</PERSON> has made some smart moves and some controversial ones.
By contrast, he's won kudos for his espousal of <PERSON>William Schuman</PERSON>'s "Violin Concerto," which he recently recorded for Angel/EMI along with <PERSON>Leonard Bernstein</PERSON>'s engaging "Serenade for Violin Solo, Strings and <ORGANIZATION>Percussion</ORGANIZATION>." 
Aided by the fluid playing of the <LOCATION>St. Louis Symphony</LOCATION> under <PERSON>Leonard Slatkin</PERSON>'s direction, this "Serenade" really swings.
At Avery Fisher Hall here, <PERSON>Mr. McDuffie</PERSON> was heard recently with <PERSON>Mr. Menuhin</PERSON> and the <LOCATION>Warsaw Sinfonia</LOCATION> in more conventional fare -- <PERSON>Bruch</PERSON>'s overwrought "Violin Concerto in G Minor." His performance was so effusive and driven that the phrases rarely breathed.
Whatever he plays, <PERSON>Mr. McDuffie</PERSON> finds satisfaction in the music itself -- "something greater out there than me," as he puts it during an interview at the <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> apartment he shares with wife, <PERSON>Camille</PERSON>, a literary publicist. "A normal person did not write the Beethoven `Violin Concerto, '" he declares. "Even when I hear it played badly, I'm still humbled by the piece.
<PERSON>Ms. Jepson</PERSON> is a free-lance music writer in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
However, these figures don't seem to worry <PERSON>Thomas A. Durkin</PERSON>, an economist at the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Board</ORGANIZATION>.
In a paper presented at the recent annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Business Economists</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Durkin</PERSON> comments that "installment credit always grows rapidly in cyclical advances, and growth in this cycle is very typical of earlier experiences." He adds: "We are now witnessing a slowdown which, if history is a guide, could persist for a while." 
"Consumers appear unwilling to add to their leverage to support their spending," <PERSON>Bruce Steinberg</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION> economist, says. "As a result, household debt appears to be stabilizing at around 63% of GNP." 
When last we left him, <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> Agent <PERSON>Nick Mancuso</PERSON> had solved a murder mystery, unraveled a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> political scandal, and racked up some pretty good ratings numbers in the miniseries "Favorite Son." What next for the crusty <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agent with the heart of gold?
Week by week on "Mancuso FBI" (<ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>, Fridays, 10 p.m. ET), he pokes around the crime styles of the rich, famous and powerful of the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> scene -- a loose cannon on deck at the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION>. 
Along the way, we're introduced to the supporting cast: a blond bombshell secretary (<LOCATION>Randi Brazen</LOCATION> -- her real name, honest), a scheming young boss (<PERSON>Fredric Lehne</PERSON>), another blonde bombshell who's also an idealistic lawyer (Lindsay Frost), and a forensics expert (<PERSON>Charles Siebert</PERSON>). 
This is not the "Mississippi Burning" scenario that thrills his young colleagues: "Kid, you've been reading Classic Comics too long," <PERSON>Mancuso</PERSON> says. "Back in 1964, the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> had five black agents.
Executive Producers <PERSON>Steve Sohmer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jeff Bleckner</PERSON> (and writer/producers <PERSON>Ken Solarz</PERSON> and <PERSON>Steve Bello</PERSON>) have revved this show up to the breaking point. 
At least once <LOCATION>Mancuso</LOCATION>'s boss yells "In here -- now," and proceeds to dress his investigator down: "You are a dinosaur . . . a hangover in a $10 suit . . . One more word and you are out on a park bench, mister." Finally, of course, the boss gives in, but he's still yelling: "I find myself explaining anything to <PERSON>Teddy Kennedy</PERSON>, you'll be chasing stolen cars in Anchorage." 
<ORGANIZATION>Tandy</ORGANIZATION>'s stock fell $1.375 a share to close at $44 in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading. 
"<ORGANIZATION>Radio Shack</ORGANIZATION> continues to be lackluster," said <PERSON>Dennis Telzrow</PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Eppler, Guerin & Turner</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>.
He said <PERSON>Tandy</PERSON> "has done a decent job" increasing sales by manufacturing computers for others and expanding sales of its <ORGANIZATION>Grid Systems Corp.</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, which sells computers to bigger businesses, but "it's not enough to offset the problems at Radio Shack." Sales at <ORGANIZATION>Radio Shack</ORGANIZATION> stores open more than a year grew only 2% in the quarter from a year earlier, he said. 
<PERSON>Barry Bryant</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Tandy</PERSON> also has suffered from lethargic sales of its computers aimed at the home and small-office market, which are less-advanced and cheaper than computers aimed at the corporate market. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bryant</PERSON> and other analysts hope all those moves will combine to help <PERSON>Tandy</PERSON>'s results improve in the important Christmas quarter. 
The regulations, required under legislation enacted by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> last year, will apply to imports of vehicles that weren't built to meet <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government auto safety standards and were intended for use in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> or elsewhere abroad. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials estimated that gray-market imports total about 2,100 units a year, a small part of the more than three million vehicles exported to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> each year. 
According to the <LOCATION>NHTSA</LOCATION>, the new regulations will prohibit anyone other than an importer that has registered with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government, or a person who has a contract with a registered importer, from permanently importing a vehicle that doesn't meet the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auto safety standards. 
The registered importer would be required to bring such vehicles into compliance with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> safety standards, compared with the current situation in which anyone can bring in such vehicles and modify them to meet the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> standards. 
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> tightened auto safety standards for gray-market imports after <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auto dealers, including franchised foreign-car dealers, complained that they often were blamed when the second and third buyers of such vehicles found that the cars couldn't meet <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auto safety standards. 
<PERSON>Mr. Dozen</PERSON> succeeds <PERSON>Sadakane Doi</PERSON>, who will become vice chairman.
<PERSON>Yoshitoki Chino</PERSON> retains his title of chairman of <LOCATION>Daiwa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s second-largest securities firm.
While people within <LOCATION>Daiwa</LOCATION>, particularly internationalists, expected that <PERSON>Mr. Dozen</PERSON>, 52, would eventually become <PERSON>Daiwa</PERSON>'s president, the speed of his promotion surprised many.
Several observers interpreted <PERSON>Mr. Dozen</PERSON>'s appointment as an attempt by <LOCATION>Daiwa</LOCATION> to make its international operations more profitable while preparing the firm for the effects of the continuing deregulation of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s domestic markets, which should mean increased competition. 
All of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s so-called Big Four securities firms -- <ORGANIZATION>Nomura Securities Co</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest, <ORGANIZATION>Nikko Securities Co</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Yamaichi Securities Co</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Daiwa</LOCATION> -- have suffered setbacks in their attempts to break into foreign markets.
At the same time, <LOCATION>Daiwa</LOCATION> and its brethren have faced stiff competition from well-entrenched <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> competitors that have prevented them from building strong links to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> corporations and institutional investors. 
When he arrived in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in 1969 -- the start of an eight-year tour -- he tried selling Japanese yen-denominated bonds to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> investors. "He made desperate efforts, using the yellow pages from beginning to end," said <PERSON>Koji Yoneyama</PERSON>, president of <LOCATION>Daiwa</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unit. "But not a single piece of paper was sold." 
By his own account, <PERSON>Mr. Dozen</PERSON> didn't do much better with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> bonds.
In an interview a few months ago, he recalled how after some training at <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, he successfully bid for the opportunity to sell portions of 20 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> corporate bond issues.
<PERSON>Mr. Dozen</PERSON> even related the indignity suffered when he and two colleagues went on an overnight fishing expedition off the <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> shore and caught nothing.
Undaunted, <PERSON>Mr. Dozen</PERSON> said that <PERSON>Daiwa</PERSON>'s goal is to build "a high-technology oriented international organization with maybe some Japanese flavor to it." 
<PERSON>Mr. Dozen</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Daiwa</LOCATION>'s strengths were its large capital base, its influential position in the <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> market and its links to Japanese corporations and institutional investors. 
<PERSON>Mr. Dozen</PERSON> joined <PERSON>Daiwa</PERSON> upon his graduation from <ORGANIZATION>Kyoto University</ORGANIZATION> in 1959.
In his climb to the top, <PERSON>Mr. Dozen</PERSON> also headed the company's stock-exchange division, its fixed-income units and its international operations. "He was constantly picking up new things to fill out his experience; he is very well-balanced," said <PERSON>Takuro Isoda</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Daiwa</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unit in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
If <PERSON>Mr. Dozen</PERSON> has a weakness, it may be his golf game. "He digs in the sand instead of hitting the ball, like a farmer," said <PERSON>Mr. Yoneyama</PERSON>. 
FOREIGN PRIME RATES: <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> 13.50%; <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> 9%; <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> 4.875%; <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> 8.50%; <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> 15%.
<ORGANIZATION>FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORP.</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Freddie Mac</ORGANIZATION>): Posted yields on 30-year mortgage commitments for delivery within 30 days. 9.86%, standard conventional fixed-rate mortgages; 7.875%, 2% rate capped one-year adjustable rate mortgages.
<ORGANIZATION>FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Fannie Mae</ORGANIZATION>): Posted yields on 30 year mortgage commitments for delivery within 30 days (priced at par). 9.80%, standard conventional fixed-rate mortgages; 8.75%, 6/2 rate capped one-year adjustable rate mortgages.
The move will give <ORGANIZATION>Nuovo Banco</ORGANIZATION> a badly needed foreign presence, and make <ORGANIZATION>Credit Agricole</ORGANIZATION> the bank's largest shareholder.
<ORGANIZATION>Nuovo Banco</ORGANIZATION> will become <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s biggest private-sector bank when it completes its scheduled merger with <ORGANIZATION>Banca Cattolica del Venetoen</ORGANIZATION> by year end. 
<ORGANIZATION>Credit Agricole</ORGANIZATION> asked a <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION> court to sequester the <ORGANIZATION>Nuovo Banco</ORGANIZATION> shares, the Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION>ANSA</ORGANIZATION> reported.
<ORGANIZATION>Nuovo Banco</ORGANIZATION>'s second largest shareholder, the <ORGANIZATION>Fiat S.p.</ORGANIZATION>
<LOCATION>Gemina</LOCATION>, which owns 13.26% of <ORGANIZATION>Nuovo Banco</ORGANIZATION>, abstained in the final vote on <ORGANIZATION>Credit Agricole</ORGANIZATION>, which was nonetheless approved by a majority of shareholders. 
The linkup with <ORGANIZATION>Credit Agricole</ORGANIZATION> will give <ORGANIZATION>Nuovo Banco</ORGANIZATION> its first foreign presence since it was formed from the wreck of the old <ORGANIZATION>Banco Ambrosiano</ORGANIZATION>, which collapsed amid scandal after the death of Chairman <PERSON>Roberto Calvi</PERSON> in 1982.
<LOCATION>Generali</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s biggest insurer, last month offered 5,500 lire a share for the <ORGANIZATION>Nuovo Banco</ORGANIZATION> stake held by <ORGANIZATION>Banco Popolare di Milano</ORGANIZATION>, the bank's largest shareholder, which announced plans to sell the holdings earlier this year. 
A <ORGANIZATION>Generali</ORGANIZATION> spokesman declined to comment on <ORGANIZATION>Nuovo Banco</ORGANIZATION>'s rejection of the insurer's offer. 
On the <ORGANIZATION>Milan stock exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Nuovo Banco</ORGANIZATION>'s shares jumped to 4,830 lire each from 4,695 lire Friday. 
<ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> was given an $89.6 million <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> contract for nuclear propulsion parts. 
<ORGANIZATION>Westinghouse Electric Corp.</ORGANIZATION> also won a $75.5 million <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> contract for nuclear propulsion parts. 
<ORGANIZATION>Federal Data Corp.</ORGANIZATION> was issued a $14.5 million <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> contract for computer systems. 
<ORGANIZATION>American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ORGANIZATION> was awarded an $11.5 million <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> contract for oceanographic services. 
A federal judge granted a temporary stay of the <ORGANIZATION>California Student Aid Commission</ORGANIZATION>'s emergency action to stop guaranteeing loans for <ORGANIZATION>National Technical Schools</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>United Education & Software Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>California Student Aid Commission</ORGANIZATION> took the action Oct. 15 after a government audit cited <ORGANIZATION>National Technical Schools</ORGANIZATION> for having courses too short to be eligible for the educational loan program and having a student drop-out rate far in excess of federal standards, and it alleged other serious violations of law and regulations.
<ORGANIZATION>United Education & Software</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> education services company, called the commission's action "precipitous and unwarranted." 
<ORGANIZATION>United Education & Software</ORGANIZATION> posted a $250,000 bond against potential losses to the student aid commission and to taxpayers in guaranteeing any more loans for <ORGANIZATION>National Technical Schools</ORGANIZATION> students prior to the hearing. 
<LOCATION>SMYRNA</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION> -- The auto-dealer strip in this booming suburb runs nearly five miles along <LOCATION>Cobb Parkway</LOCATION>, stretching from the Perimeter highway that circles <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> to the "Big Chicken," a pullet-roofed fast-food restaurant and local landmark. 
Alongside such long-familiar names as Chevrolet, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Dodge</ORGANIZATION> are nameplates that didn't exist until three years ago: <ORGANIZATION>Acura</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Sterling</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Hyundai</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Malcolm MacDougall</PERSON>, vice chairman of the <LOCATION>Jordan</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>McGrath</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Case & Taylor</ORGANIZATION> advertising agency in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, calls the proliferation "nameplate mania." He says the number of automobile choices is causing stress among consumers today, and that people will simply ignore new models that lack a well-defined image. "The winners," he predicts, "will be brands from car makers that have traditionally been associated with quality and value." 
He applauds <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Nissan Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> for creating separate divisions for their new luxury models, rather than simply adding more nameplates to their standard car lines. 
Some auto executives believe the benefits of more choice outweigh the drawbacks. "There's more noise out there, and the consumer may have to work harder to cut through it," says <PERSON>Vincent P. Barabba</PERSON>, executive director of market research and planning at <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> "But the reward is that there's less need to make tradeoffs" in choosing one's wheels. 
Jeanene Page, of <LOCATION>North Salt Lake City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, likes the broader selection.
She wants something big, and already has looked at the <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler New Yorker</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Lincoln Town Car</LOCATION>.
For every brand like <PERSON>Renault</PERSON> or <ORGANIZATION>Fiat</ORGANIZATION> that has been squeezed out, others such as <LOCATION>Isuzu</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Daihatsu</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi</ORGANIZATION> have come in. 
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> launched the <ORGANIZATION>Geo</ORGANIZATION> marque this year to sell cars made in partnership with foreign auto makers, and next year <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s long-awaited Saturn cars will make their debut.
<ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> created the <ORGANIZATION>Merkur</ORGANIZATION> nameplate in 1985 to sell its German-made touring sedans in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
For the survey, <ORGANIZATION>Peter D. Hart Research Associates</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Roper Organization</ORGANIZATION> each asked about 2,000 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> consumers about their buying habits. 
Generally, imports appeal most to Americans who live in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> and are well-educated, affluent and, especially, young. "For many baby boomers, buying a domestic car is a totally foreign experience," says <PERSON>Christopher Cedergren</PERSON>, auto-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION>J.D. Power & Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Agoura Hills</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. 
People in the automotive business disagree over how susceptible younger Americans are to brand switching. "Once buying habits are formed, they're very hard to break," declares <PERSON>Thomas Mignanelli</PERSON>, executive vice president for <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales operations. 
But out on <ORGANIZATION>Cobb Parkway</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Ted Negas</PERSON> sees it differently. "The competition is so intense that an owner's loyalty to a dealership or a car is virtually nonexistent," says <PERSON>Mr. Negas</PERSON>, vice president of <PERSON>Ed Voyles Oldsmobile</PERSON>, one of the first dealerships to locate on the strip.
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Cadillac</ORGANIZATION> division, ignoring <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>'s long-held maxim that safety doesn't sell, is airing television commercials touting its cars' safety features. 
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Pontiac</ORGANIZATION> division is offering a turbo-charged V-6 engine on its Grand Prix model, even though it expects to sell only about 4,000 cars equipped with that option.
Americans spent more than $190 billion on new cars and trucks last year, and just 1% of that market exceeded <ORGANIZATION>Polaroid Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's sales of $1.86 billion. "Even if it's only 1%," says <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Barabba</PERSON>, "would you throw away sales the size of Polaroid?" 
<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> stocks closed firmer Monday, with the <ORGANIZATION>Nikkei</ORGANIZATION> index making its fifth consecutive daily gain.
Stocks also rose in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, while the <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> market was mixed. 
In <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Nikkei</ORGANIZATION> index added 99.14 to 35585.52.
In early trading in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION>Nikkei</ORGANIZATION> index rose 1.08 points to 35586.60. 
On Monday, traders noted that some investors took profits against the backdrop of the <ORGANIZATION>Nikkei</ORGANIZATION>'s fast-paced recovery following its plunge last Monday in reaction to the Oct. 13 drop in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> stock prices. 
<PERSON>Hiroyuki Wada</PERSON>, general manager of the stock department at <ORGANIZATION>Okasan Securities</ORGANIZATION>, said Monday's trading was "unfocused." 
Investors took profits on major construction shares, which advanced last week, shifting their attention to some midsize companies such as <ORGANIZATION>Aoki Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Tobishima</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Maeda</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Teijin</LOCATION> was up 15 at 936, and <ORGANIZATION>Kyowa Hakko</ORGANIZATION> gained 30 to 1,770.
<PERSON>Kikkoman</PERSON> was up 30 to 1,600, receiving investor interest for its land property holdings near <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, a trader said. 
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> prices closed modestly higher in the year's thinnest turnover, a condition that underscored a lack of conviction ahead of a <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> balance of payments report Tuesday. 
Brokers said the declines early in the day were partly caused by losses of the ruling <ORGANIZATION>Christian-Democratic Union</ORGANIZATION> in communal elections in the state of <ORGANIZATION>Baden-Wuerttemberg</ORGANIZATION>.
The start of a weeklong conference by the <ORGANIZATION>IG Metall</ORGANIZATION> metal worker union in <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> is drawing attention to the impending wage negotiations, which could boost companies' personnel costs next year, they said. 
But <PERSON>Norbert Braeuer</PERSON>, chief trader at <ORGANIZATION>Hessische Landesbank Girozentrale</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Helaba</LOCATION>), said he expects share prices to move upward in the coming weeks. 
Banking stocks were the major gainers Monday amid hope that interest rates have peaked, as <ORGANIZATION>Deutsche Bank</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Dresdner Bank</ORGANIZATION> added 4 marks each to 664 marks ($357) and 326 marks, respectively.
Auto shares were mixed, as <ORGANIZATION>Daimler-Benz</ORGANIZATION> firmed 2 to 723, <ORGANIZATION>Bayerische Motoren Werke</ORGANIZATION> lost the same amount to 554, and <ORGANIZATION>Volkswagen</ORGANIZATION> inched down 1.4 to 451.6. 
Elsewhere, prices closed higher in <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION>, lower in <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION>, mixed in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> and unchanged in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. 
Shares closed higher in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, and were lower in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION>.
Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION>.
At a private dinner Thursday, <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION> chief executive <PERSON>Frederick Joseph</PERSON> delivered a sobering message about the junk bond market to officials of <ORGANIZATION>Prudential Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. 
He said <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> -- the leading underwriter of high-risk junk bonds -- could no longer afford to sell any junk offerings if they might later become troubled because <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> risked losing its highly lucrative junk franchise. 
For many money managers, the past four months have been humiliating. "This is the worst shakeout ever in the junk market, and it could take years before it's over," says <PERSON>Mark Bachmann</PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor's Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a credit rating company. 
The fragile market received its biggest jolt last month from <ORGANIZATION>Campeau Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which created its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> retailing empire with more than $3 billion in junk financing.
<ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION> developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale</ORGANIZATION>'s department store chain up for sale.
In an interview, <PERSON>Mr. Joseph</PERSON> says his dinner discussion with the <ORGANIZATION>Prudential</ORGANIZATION> executives acknowledged problems for junk. "What I thought I was saying is that the market is troubled but still viable and, appropriately enough, quite quality-conscious, which is not at all bad," he says. "Nobody's been perfect in their credit judgments the past couple years, and we're going to make sure our default rates are going to be in the acceptable parameters of the market." 
At closely held <ORGANIZATION>Deltec Securities Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, junk bond money managers <PERSON>Amy K. Minella</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hannah H. Strasser</PERSON> say the problems of the junk market go deeper than a temporary malaise.
Investors, trying to raise cash, have sold "large liquid issues" such as <ORGANIZATION>RJR Holdings Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Kroger Co.</ORGANIZATION>; declines in these benchmark issues have contributed to the market's distress. 
And, <ORGANIZATION>Deltec</ORGANIZATION> said, buying has been severely reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation. "In fact, savings and loans were sellers of high yield holdings throughout the quarter," <PERSON>Deltec</PERSON> said. 
<PERSON>Ms. Minella</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ms. Strasser</PERSON> say they are managing their junk portfolios defensively, building cash and selectively upgrading the overall quality. 
Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Prudential</ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest insurer and the biggest investor in junk bonds, has seen the value of its junk bond portfolio drop to $6.5 billion from $7 billion since August because of falling junk prices. "We certainly do have a lack of liquidity here, and it's something to be concerned about," says <PERSON>James A. Gregoire</PERSON>, a managing director. "I have no reason to think things will get worse, but this market has a knack for surprising us.
Although the majority of junk bonds outstanding show no signs of default, the market has downgraded many junk issues as if they were in trouble, says <PERSON>Stuart Reese</PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION>Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's $17 billion investment-grade public bond portfolio. "But we think the risks are there for things getting a lot worse.
The string of big junk bond defaults, which have been a major cause of the market's problems this year, probably will persist, some analysts say. "If anything, we're going to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined," says <PERSON>Paul Asquith</PERSON>, associate professor at the <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Sloan School of Management</ORGANIZATION>. 
One indication of a growing number of junk defaults, <PERSON>Mr. Asquith</PERSON> says, is that about half of the $3 billion of corporate bonds outstanding that have been lowered to a default rating by <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> this year are junk bonds sold during the market's big issue years of 1984 through 1986. 
These bonds, now rated single-D, include junk offerings by <ORGANIZATION>AP Industries</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Savings</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>), <ORGANIZATION>First Texas Savings Association</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Gilbraltar Financial Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Integrated Resources Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Metropolitan Broadcasting Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Resorts International Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Southmark Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Vyquest Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
"Obviously, we got a lot more smoke than fire from the people who told us the market wasn't so risky," says <PERSON>Bradford Cornell</PERSON>, professor of finance at <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Anderson Graduate School of Management</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Cornell</PERSON> says: "The junk market is no bonanza as <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> claimed, but it also isn't a disaster as the doomsayers say." 
During the past three weeks, for example, <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> has sold $1.3 billion of new junk bonds for <ORGANIZATION>Turner Broadcasting Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Uniroyal Chemical</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Continental Air</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Duff & Phelps</ORGANIZATION>. 
Still, the list of troubled <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> bond offerings dwarfs that of any firm on <ORGANIZATION>Wall Street</ORGANIZATION>, as does its successful offerings.
Troubled Drexel-underwritten issues include <ORGANIZATION>Resorts International</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Braniff</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Integrated Resources</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>SCI</ORGANIZATION> TV, <ORGANIZATION>Gillette Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Western Electric</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Southmark</LOCATION>. 
"Quality junk bonds will continue to trade well," says <PERSON>Michael Holland</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Asset Management Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "But the deals that never should have been brought have now become nuclear waste." 
"Their principal asset is <ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION> common stock," says <PERSON>Jeffrey Halis</PERSON>, who runs <ORGANIZATION>Sabre Associates</ORGANIZATION>, an investment fund that owns <ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION> shares. "If they tried to sell, they'd be chasing their own tail.
Though the ink is barely dry on its new, post-bankruptcy law structure, <PERSON>Bill Bullock</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION>'s head of investor relations, says the company is continually pondering "whether there is a better way to be structured.
And both the trust and <ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION> are seeking to avoid the bad publicity that, in the asbestos era, tarred the <ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION> name.
They are, nonetheless, high on <ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION>'s management. "It's one of the best in the business," says <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers</ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON>Stephen Dobi</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Paul Kleinaitis</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Duff & Phelps</ORGANIZATION>, says, "Even though they have borrowing power, they have been disciplined about acquisitions." And <PERSON>Mr. Kleinaitis</PERSON> says that with 80% of its stock in friendly hands, <ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION> is the rare publicly traded company that can ignore short-term stock fluctuations and plan for the long haul. 
<PERSON>David Boren</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Intelligence Committee</ORGANIZATION> chairman, is upset that someone leaked a letter to the committee from the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration suggesting that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> would undertake to warn Panamanian thug <PERSON>Manuel Noriega</PERSON> if it got wind of an impending coup that might result in his assassination. 
If the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> has become a protection service for <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> people ought to know.
The President of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> urged the Panamanian armed forces to move against <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON>.
For example, what exactly did the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> tell <PERSON>Major Giroldi</PERSON> and his fellow coup plotters about <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> laws and executive orders on assassinations?
What part did <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> warnings play in the major's unwillingness to pull the trigger when he had General <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> in custody, but was under attack by pro-Noriega troops?
Maybe we need a <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> version of the <LOCATION>Miranda</LOCATION> warning: You have the right to conceal your coup intentions, because we may rat on you.
<ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON>William Webster</PERSON>, hardly a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> malcontent, got the debate started last week by noting that the executive order banning assassinations had contributed to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> paralysis during the coup.
The <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION>'s Deputy Director of Operations, <PERSON>Richard Stoltz</PERSON>, tried to smooth things over a few days later, but instead simply underlined <PERSON>Mr. Webster</PERSON>'s point. "The interpretation" of the executive order, <PERSON>Mr. Stoltz</PERSON> said, "and the way in which the various committees have over time interpreted it, has led in my view to a proper caution on the part of operators, including me." In other words, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> won't let the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> do much of anything anymore, and that's fine with the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION>.
Witness the <LOCATION>Walsh</LOCATION> prosecution of <PERSON>Ollie North</PERSON>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Intelligence Committee</ORGANIZATION>'s ranking <ORGANIZATION>Republican</ORGANIZATION>, Senator <PERSON>William Cohen</PERSON>, joined with Senator <PERSON>George Mitchell</PERSON> to write a best seller about Iran-Contra, deploring "Men of Zeal." No doubt many people in the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>National Security Council</ORGANIZATION> have read it.
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> would do himself and the country a favor by rescinding the order as an ambiguous intrusion on his ability to defend <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s national security.
There are of course good reasons the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> shouldn't get into the assassination business, but rescinding the executive order is not the same thing as saying the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> should start passing out exploding cigars.
As it now stands, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> can bomb <LOCATION>Tripoli</LOCATION>, but can't "assassinate" Colonel <PERSON>Gadhafi</PERSON>.
It can send a fighter squadron to strafe terrorist hideouts in the <LOCATION>Bekaa Valley</LOCATION>, but can't shoot <PERSON>Abu Nidal</PERSON>.
Both the assassination order and the quality of debate in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> are telling the world that the only way the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> will kill a madman is by making sure we take some innocent civilians with him. 
Joint-research programs have proliferated as <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies seek to spread the risks and costs of commercializing new superconductors and to meet the challenges posed by foreign consortia, especially in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
The <LOCATION>Wilmington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Del.</LOCATION>, chemicals concern previously signed research superconductor agreements with <ORGANIZATION>Oak Ridge National Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> and with <ORGANIZATION>Argonne National Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>.
Last year, <ORGANIZATION>Du Pont</ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay $4.5 million for rights to superconductor work at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Houston</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard</ORGANIZATION> is a <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, computer maker.
The <LOCATION>Los Alamos</LOCATION> laboratory is one of three <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Department of Energy</ORGANIZATION> national laboratories designed as pilot centers to foster joint industry-government programs to speed the transfer of new superconductors to the marketplace. 
<ORGANIZATION>MCI Communications Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it received a three-year contract valued at more than $15 million to provide network, credit-card and other telecommunications services to <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Liberty National Bancorp</ORGANIZATION> said its acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Florence Deposit Bank</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>, first announced in April, has been completed in a transaction valued at $13.1 million. 
<ORGANIZATION>Liberty National</ORGANIZATION> exchanged about 78.64 shares of its common stock for each of <ORGANIZATION>Florence Deposit</ORGANIZATION>'s 5,600 shares outstanding. 
For years, a strict regimen governed the staff meetings at <ORGANIZATION>Nissan Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's technical center in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s western suburbs. 
<ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>'s decades-old corporate song filled with references to <LOCATION>Mount Fuji</LOCATION> has been scrapped in favor of a snappy tune sung by a popular Japanese vocalist. 
And in a Japanese corporate first, <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> recently opened the first coed company dormitory for single employees at the suburban <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> technical center. "We had lots of internal debate about this one," concedes <PERSON>Tadahiko Fukuyama</PERSON>, a senior public-relations official. "But in the end, top management decided to follow the voice of the younger generation." 
This corporate glasnost is a big reason <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>, after years of making lackluster cars and lousy profits, has loosened up its rigid ways and now is riding a string of hits, ranging from the sleek Maxima sedan and Porsche-like 300ZX to the whimsically nostalgic Pao, a minicar sold only in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Atsushi Muramatsu</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president for finance, helped set the tone in December 1986, when the company was heading toward the first operating loss by a Japanese auto maker since the nation's postwar recovery. "This is a time of self-criticism to discover what is wrong with us," he said.
<PERSON>Yutaka Kume</PERSON>, who took the helm as <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>'s president in June 1985, added simply, "I am deeply disappointed." 
<ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s second-largest auto maker and the world's fourth-largest, was getting beat up not only by its bigger rival, <ORGANIZATION>Toyota Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, but also by <ORGANIZATION>Honda Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the most successful Japanese car company in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> but a relative pipsqueak in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>'s market share in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> had been dropping year by year since the beginning of the decade.
Consider the experience of <PERSON>Satoko Kitada</PERSON>, a 30-year-old designer of vehicle interiors who joined <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> in 1982.
Meanwhile, President <PERSON>Kume</PERSON> ordered everyone from top executives to rookie designers to go "town watching," to visit chic parts of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> to try to gain insights into developing cars for trend-setters. 
One group of middle-aged manufacturing men from the company's <LOCATION>Zama</LOCATION> plant outside <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> was supposed to check out a trendy restaurant in the city.
<PERSON>Mr. Kume</PERSON> himself visited <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s upscale <LOCATION>Aoyama</LOCATION> district.
He liked the well-lighted lobby display of <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION>'s cars and trucks so much that he had <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>'s gloomy lobby exhibit refurbished.
Later, <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> borrowed other <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION> practices, including an engineering "idea contest" to promote inventiveness.
<ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> handled the die-hards in a typically Japanese fashion: They weren't fired but instead "were neglected," says <PERSON>Kouji Hori</PERSON>, the personnel manager at the <ORGANIZATION>Nissan Technical Center</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> helped develop a <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> restaurant with both vehicles as its design theme.
<ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> concedes that it won't recoup all its market-share losses in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> until at least 1995, and even that timetable might prove optimistic. "Everyone else is going to catch up" with <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>'s innovative designs, says <PERSON>A. Rama Krishna</PERSON>, auto analyst at <ORGANIZATION>First Boston (Japan) Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>'s pace of new-model hits will slow, he adds, just as arch-rival <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION> unleashes its own batch of new cars. 
Likewise, in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> has grabbed 5.2% of the car market so far this year, up from 4.5% a year ago.
In compact and subcompact cars, the bread-and-butter sales generators for Japanese auto makers, <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> still trails <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION>. 
The Stanza has been a nonentity compared with <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION>'s hugely successful Accord and <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION>'s Camry.
<ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>'s risk is that its low-base-price strategy might get lost amid the highly publicized rebates being offered by <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>'s Big Three.
But "on a new car, a rebate doesn't work well" because it cheapens the vehicle's image, contends <PERSON>Thomas D. Mignanelli</PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales arm. 
At the opposite end of the market, <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> launches its luxury Infiniti division on Nov. 8 -- three years after <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION> pioneered Japanese luxury cars and two months after <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION>'s Lexus went on sale.
On the other hand, <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>'s sales goals for Infiniti are modest compared with <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION>'s targets for Lexus.
<ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> will build only about 3,500 of the $38,000 Infiniti Q45 sedans each month, sending about 2,000 of them to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and keeping the rest for sale in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION> wants to sell about 49,000 Lexus LS400 sedans next year in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> alone. 
But on reflection, <PERSON>Mr. Oka</PERSON> says, he concluded that <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> is being prudent in following its slow-startup strategy instead of simply copying Lexus. "Infiniti is <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>'s big business move for the 21st century, and we're in no hurry to generate large profits right away," <PERSON>Mr. Oka</PERSON> says.
The big reason: For all its cost-cutting, <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> remains less efficient than <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION>.
In its last fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>'s profit represented just 2.3% of sales, compared with 4.3% at <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> is the world's only auto maker currently building vehicles in all three of the world's key economic arenas -- the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
For example, <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> operations include 10 separate subsidiaries -- for manufacturing, sales, design, research, etc. -- that report separately back to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
And in July, <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> manufacturing plant beat back a <ORGANIZATION>United Auto Workers</ORGANIZATION> organizing effort with aggressive tactics that have left some workers bitter. 
"We are in a transitional phase from being a Japanese company to becoming an international company based in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>," says <PERSON>Mr. Muramatsu</PERSON>, the executive vice president.
He promises that <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> will soon establish a holding company overseeing all <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> operations, just as it's doing in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Giovanni Agnelli</PERSON>, a limited partnership that is the master holding company for <ORGANIZATION>Fiat</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Agnelli</PERSON> family, owns approximately 75% of the shares in <ORGANIZATION>Istituto Finanziario Industriale</ORGANIZATION>, which in turn owns approximately 40% of <ORGANIZATION>Fiat</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s biggest private-sector industrial group. 
The company said <PERSON>Maria Sole Agnelli Teodorani</PERSON>, sister of <ORGANIZATION>Fiat</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Giovanni Agnelli</PERSON>, agreed to trade her shares in <ORGANIZATION>IFI</ORGANIZATION> for new ordinary shares in the limited partnership, which will give her control of 4.67% of <ORGANIZATION>Giovanni Agnelli & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <PERSON>Aga Khan</PERSON>, meanwhile, agreed to trade some of his stake in Luxembourg-based <ORGANIZATION>Ifint S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, another <PERSON>Agnelli</PERSON> family company, for 7.45% of <ORGANIZATION>Giovanni Agnelli & Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's capital.
The <PERSON>Aga Khan</PERSON> owns 10% of <ORGANIZATION>Ifint</ORGANIZATION>'s capital, while <ORGANIZATION>IFI</ORGANIZATION> owns 23%. 
As a result of the transaction, which is expected to be approved at a shareholders meeting Nov. 24, <ORGANIZATION>Giovanni Agnelli & Co.</ORGANIZATION> will control 79.18% of <ORGANIZATION>IFI</ORGANIZATION>'s ordinary shares.
<ORGANIZATION>IFI</ORGANIZATION> also has nonvoting preferred shares, which are quoted on the <ORGANIZATION>Milan stock exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 
The move strengthens the existing links between the <PERSON>Agnellis</PERSON> and the <PERSON>Aga Khan</PERSON>, the head of the world's Ismaili Moslems who is a longtime family friend and frequently goes sailing with <PERSON>Mr. Agnelli</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Agnelli</PERSON> and the Aga Khan also have some business ties, and a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Agnelli company</ORGANIZATION> didn't rule out that the current agreement could lead to further collaboration.
For instance, <ORGANIZATION>Ifint</ORGANIZATION> earlier this year bought an 18% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Alisarda</ORGANIZATION>, the Aga Khan's airline, which flies between <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sardinia</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Giovanni Agnelli & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which was formed in January 1987 as a way of keeping the <PERSON>Agnellis</PERSON>' controlling stake in <ORGANIZATION>Fiat</ORGANIZATION> together despite an ever-growing family tree, has been playing a more active role in the <ORGANIZATION>Agnelli group</ORGANIZATION> of late. 
Five officials of this investment banking firm were elected directors: <PERSON>E. Garrett Bewkes III</PERSON>, a 38-year-old managing director in the mergers and acquisitions department; <PERSON>Michael R. Dabney</PERSON>, 44, a managing director who directs the principal activities group which provides funding for leveraged acquisitions; <LOCATION>Richard Harriton</LOCATION>, 53, a general partner who heads the correspondent clearing services; <PERSON>Michael Minikes</PERSON>, 46, a general partner who is treasurer; and <PERSON>William J. Montgoris</PERSON>, 42, a general partner who is also senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer.
But at a time of mounting concern over alcohol abuse, some liquor marketers consider <ORGANIZATION>Seagram</ORGANIZATION>'s frequent buyer promotion risky. "I'm surprised they're doing this," says <PERSON>Penn Kavanagh</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Schieffelin & Somerset Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which markets Johnnie Walker scotches. "I would be very leery of anything that says if you drink more, you get more." 
Others question the impact on Chivas's upscale image of a promotion that has customers soaking off labels. "It's really bizarre," says <PERSON>Albert Lerman</PERSON>, creative director at the <ORGANIZATION>Wells Rich Greene</ORGANIZATION> ad agency. "Chivas has an image of something you would savor, rather than guzzle." 
Last year, <ORGANIZATION>J&B Scotch</ORGANIZATION> offered 500 <ORGANIZATION>TWA</ORGANIZATION> frequent flier miles in exchange for a label.
<ORGANIZATION>Seagram</ORGANIZATION> asks customers to buy only two or three bottles over a 12-month period, says <PERSON>Richard Shaw</PERSON>, vice president of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> direct marketing. "We're not asking them to save up 50 proof-of-purchases.
The <LOCATION>Secaucus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, company has formed a joint venture with a distributor called <ORGANIZATION>La Lecheria</ORGANIZATION> to market a higher-fat milk targeted at Hispanic consumers.
A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Borden Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest milk producer, concedes <ORGANIZATION>Goya</ORGANIZATION> may be on to something.
<ORGANIZATION>Goya</ORGANIZATION> is selling Leche Fresca in nearly 500 grocery stores and bodegas in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>.
And it's adding 15 to 20 new outlets a day, says <PERSON>Greg Ricca</PERSON>, sales director at <ORGANIZATION>La Lecheria</ORGANIZATION>.
To increase their share of that business, jewelry makers such as <ORGANIZATION>Crystal Brands Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Trifari</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Monet</ORGANIZATION> units and <ORGANIZATION>Swank Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, maker of <PERSON>Anne Klein</PERSON> jewelry, are launching new lines with as much fanfare as the fragrance companies.
"We've started trying just about anything to keep sales moving in the stores," says <PERSON>Kim Renk</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Swank</ORGANIZATION> vice president.
<ORGANIZATION>Procter & Gamble Co.</ORGANIZATION> recently introduced refillable versions of four products, including Tide and Mr. Clean, in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, but doesn't plan to bring them to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Marketers believe most Americans won't make the convenience trade-off. . . . <ORGANIZATION>Braumeisters Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> tests a beer brewed with oat bran, rather than rice or corn.
<ORGANIZATION>Armstrong World Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> agreed in principle to sell its carpet operations to <ORGANIZATION>Shaw Industries Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>, which has faced a takeover threat from the <PERSON>Belzberg</PERSON> family of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> since July, said that disposing of the carpet business would improve "total financial performance." The move also would allow the company to concentrate on core businesses, which include ceramic tile, floor coverings and furniture. 
Moreover, such a sale could help <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> reassure its investors and deter the <PERSON>Belzbergs</PERSON>, who own a 9.85% stake in the <LOCATION>Lancaster</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, company.
Analysts hailed the planned transaction as being beneficial to <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Shaw</ORGANIZATION>, the market leader in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> carpet industry, with an estimated 17% to 20% share.
<ORGANIZATION>Shaw</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Dalton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, has annual sales of about $1.18 billion, and has economies of scale and lower raw-material costs that are expected to boost the profitability of <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>'s brands, sold under the <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Evans-Black</ORGANIZATION> names. 
Yesterday, in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Shaw</ORGANIZATION>'s shares closed ex-dividend at $26.125, up $2.25.
<ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>'s shares, also listed on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>, closed at $39.125, up 12.5 cents. 
Yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> announced an agreement to sell its small <ORGANIZATION>Applied Color Systems</ORGANIZATION> unit to a subsidiary of the Swiss company, <ORGANIZATION>Brauerei Eichof Ltd</ORGANIZATION>.
South Korean consumer prices rose 5% in the first 10 months of this year, matching the government's target for the entire year, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Korea</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Economic Planning Board</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide</ORGANIZATION> named <PERSON>Mr. Achenbaum</PERSON>, 62, vice chairman of professional services, reporting directly to <PERSON>Carl Spielvogel</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer.
They have since mellowed, although one senior <ORGANIZATION>Young & Rubicam</ORGANIZATION> executive, echoing others, said: "I think ad agencies owe <PERSON>Carl</PERSON> {<PERSON>Spielvogel</PERSON>} a vote of thanks for getting him out of the consulting business." 
But industry executives also believe hiring <PERSON>Mr. Achenbaum</PERSON> is a shrewd move for <ORGANIZATION>Backer Spielvogel</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi & Saatchi</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Achenbaum</PERSON> has counted among his clients some of the most visible blue-chip advertisers in the country, including <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Seagram</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Backer Spielvogel</ORGANIZATION> clients <ORGANIZATION>Hyundai</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>J.P. Morgan</ORGANIZATION>.
At <ORGANIZATION>Backer Spielvogel</ORGANIZATION>, he will work with clients and potential clients on marketing strategies; aside from agency compensation issues, he helped <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>, for example, come up with its positioning and pricing for its new Infiniti line. 
<PERSON>Mr. Spielvogel</PERSON> said he hopes <PERSON>Mr. Achenbaum</PERSON> will do some strategic consulting at the agency for "non-clients, in hopes that they become clients." 
At <ORGANIZATION>Backer Spielvogel</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Spielvogel</PERSON>'s hallmark has been personal involvement with all major clients.
<PERSON>Mr. Achenbaum</PERSON>, too, delves into his clients' business. "<PERSON>Carl</PERSON> has a much higher degree of intimacy with his clients than is ordinary for an agency his size.
And with <PERSON>Al</PERSON>'s record of being a delver and a detail guy, you can see how the two fit," said <PERSON>Alan Gottesman</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Achenbaum</PERSON>'s move follows the announcement last month that his consulting partner, <PERSON>Stanley Canter</PERSON>, 66, would retire.
Before becoming a consultant in 1974, <PERSON>Mr. Achenbaum</PERSON> was a senior executive at <ORGANIZATION>J. Walter Thompson Co</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Spielvogel</PERSON> added pointedly: "The pressure on commissions didn't begin with <PERSON>Al Achenbaum</PERSON>." 
<PERSON>Mr. Spielvogel</PERSON> said <PERSON>Mr. Achenbaum</PERSON> will work with clients to determine the mix of promotion, merchandising, publicity and other marketing outlets, and to integrate those services.
He will concentrate on, among others, <ORGANIZATION>J.P. Morgan</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Hyundai</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Achenbaum</PERSON> helped <ORGANIZATION>Morgan</ORGANIZATION> in its recent agency search, and he has a long relationship with <ORGANIZATION>Hyundai</ORGANIZATION>, which is having severe troubles, including declining sales. 
<PERSON>Leonard Matthews</PERSON>, then-president of the <ORGANIZATION>American Association of Advertising Agencies</ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON>Mr. Achenbaum</PERSON> a "quisling" in an incendiary 1987 speech.
Yesterday, <PERSON>Mr. Matthews</PERSON>, now a consultant with the <LOCATION>Stamford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, firm <ORGANIZATION>Matthews & Johnston</ORGANIZATION>, quipped, "I think he'll be very good at that {new job}.
<PERSON>J. Nicholas Hahn</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Cotton Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's president and chief executive, was an outspoken critic of <ORGANIZATION>WPP Group</ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy Group</ORGANIZATION> earlier this year.
During the takeover, <PERSON>Mr. Hahn</PERSON> said he would put his account up for review if <ORGANIZATION>WPP</ORGANIZATION>'s bid were successful, but he didn't. 
With the new TV spots, <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy & Mather</ORGANIZATION> has opted for a family style with lots of laughter, hugs and tears. "We're making a fairly obvious plea for some emotional reaction," says <PERSON>Tom Rost</PERSON>, creative director at <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy & Mather</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Cotton Inc.</ORGANIZATION> will spend nearly $2 million on broadcasting on Thanksgiving Day alone, advertising on such programs as "Good Morning America," "Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade" and the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> holiday game. 
<PERSON>Mr. Mingo</PERSON> was chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION>Mingo Group</ORGANIZATION>, which he founded in 1977 and which created ads for the black market.
Clients include <ORGANIZATION>Miller Brewing Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Mingo</PERSON> was hospitalized Sept. 23 and died Monday, according to <PERSON>Samuel J. Chisholm</PERSON>, the agency's president and chief operating officer. 
EARNINGS: <ORGANIZATION>Omnicom Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, reported third-quarter net income rose 54% to $5.6 million, or 22 cents a share, from $3.6 million, or 15 cents a share, a year earlier.
<PERSON>Michael Blair</PERSON>, former president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Enfield Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, failed to win election to the company's board at a special shareholder meeting. 
<PERSON>Mr. Blair</PERSON> said after the meeting that he had filed separate lawsuits in the <ORGANIZATION>Ontario Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> for unjust dismissal against <ORGANIZATION>Enfield</ORGANIZATION> and for libel against its largest shareholder, <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Express Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, and two executives of <ORGANIZATION>Hees International Bancorp Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which controls <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Express</ORGANIZATION>. 
Holders at the meeting elected a full slate of <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Express</ORGANIZATION> nominees to <ORGANIZATION>Enfield</ORGANIZATION>'s 11-member board. 
<PERSON>Mr. Blair</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Hees</ORGANIZATION> have been feuding for months.
Yesterday's election was a sequel to <ORGANIZATION>Enfield</ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting in June when <PERSON>Mr. Blair</PERSON> disallowed proxies in favor of two <ORGANIZATION>Hees</ORGANIZATION> nominees.
The <ORGANIZATION>Ontario Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> overturned <PERSON>Mr. Blair</PERSON>'s decision.
<PERSON>Mr. Blair</PERSON> said his libel suit seeks 10 million Canadian dollars (US$8.5 million) from <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Express</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Hees</ORGANIZATION> executives <PERSON>Manfred Walt</PERSON> and <PERSON>Willard L'Heureux</PERSON>.
<ORGANIZATION>Hees</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Express</ORGANIZATION> executives couldn't be reached for comment. 
<ORGANIZATION>Hees</ORGANIZATION> is a merchant bank controlled by <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> financiers <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> and <PERSON>Edward Bronfman</PERSON>.

<ORGANIZATION>Dow Chemical Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Midland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Eli Lilly & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION>, said they completed the formation of <ORGANIZATION>Dow Elanco</ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture combining their plant-sciences businesses as well as <ORGANIZATION>Dow</ORGANIZATION>'s industrial pest-control business. 
The companies said <ORGANIZATION>Dow Elanco</ORGANIZATION> will be the largest research-based agricultural concern in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, with projected first-year revenue of $1.5 billion.
Many thanks for <PERSON>Alexander Cockburn</PERSON>'s comic masterpiece ("<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
The use of the abominable construction practices in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> -- as evidenced by the collapse of sand apartment blocks during the Armenian earthquake -- as a metaphor for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economic system was a sublime example of <PERSON>Mr. Cockburn</PERSON>'s satirical muse. 
I await his sequel: the economic and social resiliency of the <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> area and the outstanding work of the local governments and the private charitable organizations there as metaphors for the supremacy of whatever failed system <PERSON>Mr. Cockburn</PERSON> now believes in.
Researchers at <ORGANIZATION>Plant Genetic Systems N.V.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> said they have developed a genetic engineering technique for creating hybrid plants for a number of key crops. 
"The development could have a dramatic effect on farm production, especially cotton," said <PERSON>Murray Robinson</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Delta & Pine Land Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Southwide Inc.</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary that is one of the largest cotton seed producers in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
<PERSON>Jan Leemans</PERSON>, research director, said this gene was successfully introduced in oil-producing rapeseed plants, a major crop in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, using as a carrier a "promoter gene" developed by <PERSON>Robert Goldberg</PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. 
In recent years, demand for hybrid seeds has spurred research at a number of chemical and biotechnology companies, including <ORGANIZATION>Monsanto Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Shell Oil Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Eli Lilly & Co</ORGANIZATION>.
However, <PERSON>Paul Johanson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Monsanto</ORGANIZATION>'s director of plant sciences, said the company's chemical spray overcomes these problems and is "gentle on the female organ." 
<ORGANIZATION>Biosource Genetics Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Vacaville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, is developing a spray containing a gene that spreads from cell to cell and interferes with the genes that are responsible for producing pollen.
<PERSON>Robert Erwin</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Biosource</ORGANIZATION>, called <ORGANIZATION>Plant Genetic</ORGANIZATION>'s approach "interesting" and "novel," and "complementary rather than competitive." "There is a large market out there hungry for hybrid seeds," he said. 
<PERSON>Mr. Robinson</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Delta & Pine</ORGANIZATION>, the seed producer in <LOCATION>Scott</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Miss.</LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>Plant Genetic</ORGANIZATION>'s success in creating genetically engineered male steriles doesn't automatically mean it would be simple to create hybrids in all crops.
"I don't think it provides much new information on the economy," said <PERSON>Richard Rippe</PERSON>, economist at <ORGANIZATION>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc</ORGANIZATION>.

President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON> will hold an informal meeting in early December, a move that should give both leaders a political boost at home. 
The two leaders will meet on Dec. 2 and 3, alternating the two days of meetings between a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and a Soviet naval vessel in the <LOCATION>Mediterranean Sea</LOCATION>.
In announcing the meeting yesterday, <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> told reporters at the White House that neither he nor <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON> expects any "substantial decisions or agreements." Instead, he said that the purpose is simply for the two to get "better acquainted" and discuss a wide range of issues without a formal agenda. 
<LOCATION>American</LOCATION> officials have said that a meeting with the leader of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> could help bolster his stature among Soviet politicians and academics, whose support he needs. 
For his part, <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> has been criticized regularly at home for moving too slowly and cautiously in reacting to <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON>'s reforms and the historic moves away from communism in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON>George Mitchell</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>), who has been the most prominent Democratic critic of <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>'s handling of the Soviet relationship, praised the president for arranging the meeting.
<PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> said that the December meeting, which was announced simultaneously in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, will be held in the unusual setting of ships at sea to hold down the "fanfare" and force the two sides to limit participation to just small groups of advisers. "By doing it in this manner we can have, I would say, more time without the press of social activities or mandatory joint appearances, things of that nature for public consumption," <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> said. 
Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON>Eduard Shevardnadze</PERSON>, at a news conference in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, said, "As the two sides plan to hold a full-scale summit in late spring-early summer next year, they found it useful, I would say even necessary, to hold an interim informal meeting." Although no specific agreements are expected, <PERSON>Mr. Shevardnadze</PERSON> said "that doesn't mean they will be without an agenda." 
The president specifically mentioned <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economic advice to <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> as a possible topic.
<PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON> has for months been publicly urging the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> to drop its restrictions on Soviet trade.
He recently told a small group of American businessmen in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> that he hoped to sign a general trade agreement with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, possibly at the 1990 summit.
Western analysts say that, given the meeting's setting at sea, <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> is unlikely to pass up the opportunity to press once again for negotiated cuts in the navies of both the <ORGANIZATION>North Atlantic Treaty Organization</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Warsaw Pact</ORGANIZATION>. 
They argue that as the <ORGANIZATION>Kremlin</ORGANIZATION> follows through on announced plans to cut land forces -- the Soviets' area of greatest strength -- the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> should show more willingness to cut sea forces -- <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s area of greatest superiority. 
One of the reasons <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration aides are anxious to insist that the coming meeting will be informal is to avoid comparisons with the last such loosely structured superpower gathering, former President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s 1986 meeting with <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Reykjavik</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION>.
That meeting sent shivers through the Western alliance because <PERSON>Mr. Reagan</PERSON> was pulled into discussing the possible elimination of nuclear weapons without consulting <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> allies. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> said that he initiated talks with the Soviets on the informal meeting by sending a proposal to <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON> last July, which the Soviet leader readily accepted.
Though President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s political critics at home have been urging him to open a more direct dialogue with <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON>, it actually was the arguments of leaders within the Soviet bloc itself that led the president to seek the December meeting.
<PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> decided he wanted the meeting after talking in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> in July with the leaders of <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>, who urged him to support <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON>'s efforts to transform the Soviet system and to urge him to loosen his grip on <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>, a senior aide said.
While flying home from those discussions, <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> drafted a letter to <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON> suggesting an informal get-together to precede their formal summit next year.

As much as 10% of new <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> mortgage securities issued by the <ORGANIZATION>Federal National Mortgage Association</ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION>Fannie Mae</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION>Freddie Mac</ORGANIZATION>, now flow into Japanese hands. 
"You can't say it's a "tsunami" (tidal wave), but we're making some headway," says <ORGANIZATION>Fannie Mae</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, <PERSON>David O. Maxwell</PERSON>, who visits <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> at least once a year to explain and drum up investor interest in mortgage securities. "Interest is a great deal higher than it was a year ago." The steady growth of the mortgage securities market in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> has even triggered talk of building up a similar market here. 
Earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION>Blackstone Group</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investment bank, had no trouble selling out a special $570 million mortgage-securities trust it created for Japanese investors.
<ORGANIZATION>Industrial Bank of Japan</ORGANIZATION>, which claims to be the biggest Japanese buyer of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> mortgage securities, says it will more than double its purchases this year, to an amount one official puts at several billion dollars.
"Last year, there were only several big investors who were interested," says <PERSON>Kinji Kato</PERSON>, a vice president at the international arm of <ORGANIZATION>Nomura Securities Co.</ORGANIZATION> "This year, some investors are changing their policies and investing a lot." Ultimately, he says, strong demand could help to drive down interest rates on mortgage securities. 
At the moment, <ORGANIZATION>Nomura</ORGANIZATION> is the only Japanese institution authorized to act as a primary seller of <ORGANIZATION>Fannie Mae</ORGANIZATION> instruments.
"Two or three years ago, the problem was that people didn't understand the prepayment risk," says <ORGANIZATION>Nomura</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Kato</PERSON>. "So they were surprised and very disappointed by prepayment." 
Since 1985, Japanese investors have bought nearly 80% of $10 billion in <ORGANIZATION>Fannie Mae</ORGANIZATION> corporate debt issued to foreigners, money that <ORGANIZATION>Fannie Mae</ORGANIZATION> uses to buy mortgages from <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> banks.
But as the French embody a Zen-like state of blase when it comes to athletics (try finding a <ORGANIZATION>Nautilus</ORGANIZATION> machine in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>), my fellow conventioners were having none of it.
As in: "You went ballooning??!! In <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>??!!" Americans it seems have followed <PERSON>Malcolm Forbes</PERSON>'s hot-air lead and taken to ballooning in a heady way.
Some 30 balloon shows are held annually in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, including the world's largest convocation of ersatz <PERSON>Phineas Foggs</PERSON> -- the nine-day <LOCATION>Albuquerque</LOCATION> International Balloon Fiesta that attracts some 800,000 enthusiasts and more than 500 balloons, some of which are fetchingly shaped to resemble <PERSON>Carmen Miranda</PERSON>, <PERSON>Garfield</PERSON> or a 12-story-high condom. (The condom balloon was denied official entry status this year.) 
But in <LOCATION>Epinal</LOCATION>, a gray 16th-century river town adjacent to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Vosges</LOCATION> mountain region, none of these Yankee-come-lately enthusiasms for things aloft was evident.

Shareholders of the <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, title-insurance company approved the creation of this second class of stock, which will be traded on the national over-the-counter market and which the company said would be used for acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.

One rare example of a time-limited poison pill is the shareholder rights plan adopted by <ORGANIZATION>Pennzoil</ORGANIZATION> last year after it received a huge litigation settlement from <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION>.

<PERSON>Mr. Pozen</PERSON> is the general counsel and a managing director of <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Investments</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>. 
A federal judge ruled that <PERSON>Imelda Marcos</PERSON> wasn't brought to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> against her will and that marital privileges, which protect spouses from incriminating each other, don't apply in her case. 
As a result, <PERSON>Judge John F. Keenan</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> ordered <PERSON>Mrs. Marcos</PERSON> to turn over to the court all pleadings and documents she may have filed in foreign countries in opposition to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> requests for evidence.
In 1988, a year and a half after <PERSON>Mrs. Marcos</PERSON> and her late husband, <PERSON>Ferdinand Marcos</PERSON>, the ousted president of the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, fled the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> for <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, they were charged with racketeering, conspiracy, obstruction of justice and mail fraud in a scheme in which they allegedly embezzled more than $100 million from their homeland.
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> law requires criminal defendants to turn over foreign documents such as those sought in the <PERSON>Marcos</PERSON> case.
The law is meant to overcome delays caused by defendants' use of foreign procedures to block <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> requests for records, <PERSON>Judge Keenan</PERSON> said in his opinion.
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> has charged that the Marcoses' alleged crimes involved bank accounts in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and other countries. 
On the allegation of kidnapping, <PERSON>Judge Keenan</PERSON> wrote, "The suggestion that <PERSON>Mrs. Marcos</PERSON> was brought to this country against her will is unsupported by affidavit or affirmation." 
But <PERSON>Judge Keenan</PERSON> said that privilege's purpose is "fostering harmony in marriage." Because <PERSON>Mr. Marcos</PERSON> died Sept. 28, the privilege can no longer apply, the judge said. 
But <PERSON>Judge Keenan</PERSON> said that privilege is meant to protect private utterances -- not litigation papers filed with foreign governments, as <PERSON>Mrs. Marcos</PERSON>'s attorneys maintained. 
Though <PERSON>Judge Keenan</PERSON> threw out most of <PERSON>Mrs. Marcos</PERSON>'s objections, he agreed with one of her concerns: that turning over the foreign documents could violate the defendant's constitutional right against self-incrimination.
<PERSON>Judge Keenan</PERSON> also directed the prosecutors to show that <PERSON>Mrs. Marcos</PERSON>'s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination won't be violated. 
<PERSON>Mrs. Marcos</PERSON>'s attorney in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Sandor Frankel</PERSON>, declined to comment on the ruling.
<PERSON>Charles LaBella</PERSON>, the assistant <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney prosecuting the <PERSON>Marcos</PERSON> case, didn't return phone calls seeking comment. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> AND BRITISH LAW FIRMS announce rare joint venture in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Sidley & Austin</ORGANIZATION>, a leading Chicago-based law firm, and <ORGANIZATION>Ashurst Morris Crisp</ORGANIZATION>, a midsized London firm of solicitors, are scheduled today to announce plans to open a joint office in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>. 
The office will provide "one-stop shopping" for Japanese financial institutions and other clients seeking advice on access to the world capital markets, according to <PERSON>A. Bruce Schimberg</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Sidley</ORGANIZATION>'s senior banking specialist, who will move to <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> to open the office next year. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Sidley-Ashurst</ORGANIZATION> venture will also be staffed by another <ORGANIZATION>Sidley</ORGANIZATION> partner specializing in corporate law, a partner from <ORGANIZATION>Ashurst</ORGANIZATION> concentrating on acquisitions and a Japanese attorney.
The office will tap the resources of <ORGANIZATION>Sidley</ORGANIZATION>'s 700 lawyers in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> as well as the 400 <ORGANIZATION>Ashurst</ORGANIZATION> staff members in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ashurst</ORGANIZATION> is new to the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Sidley</ORGANIZATION> will maintain its association with the <ORGANIZATION>Hashidate Law Office</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>. 
THE <ORGANIZATION>UNITED AUTO WORKERS</ORGANIZATION> said it will seek a rehearing of a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> appellate court ruling against the union's claim that the state of <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> engages in wage-discrimination against female employees.
In November 1987, a district court judge in <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> ruled against the <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION>.
NEW JERSEY MERGER: One of the largest law firms in central <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> has been created through the merger of <ORGANIZATION>Norris, McLaughlin & Marcus</ORGANIZATION>, a 41-lawyer firm, and <ORGANIZATION>Manger, Kalison, McBride & Webb</ORGANIZATION>, a health-care specialty law firm with 14 lawyers.
State Senator <PERSON>J.E. "Buster" Brown</PERSON>, a Republican who is running for <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> attorney general, introduced the bill.
<PERSON>Richard Avena</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Civil Liberties Union</ORGANIZATION>, called the proposal "political gimmickry," and said it fails to recognize the drug problem as a health issue. 
<ORGANIZATION>Gulf Power</ORGANIZATION>'s guilty plea before <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Robert L. Vining</PERSON> yesterday marks the end of only one part of a wide-ranging inquiry of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Co</ORGANIZATION>.
"The terms announced today are strictly between the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Power</ORGANIZATION>," said <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON>Robert L. Barr</PERSON>. "This is only a further step in a lengthy investigation." 
In a statement, <ORGANIZATION>Southern Co</ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON>Edward L. Addison</PERSON> said, "We believe our decision to plead (guilty) to these charges is responsible and proper.
<PERSON>Mr. Barr</PERSON> said yesterday's plea by <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Power</ORGANIZATION>, which came after months of negotiations, was based on evidence that <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Power</ORGANIZATION> had set up an elaborate payment system through which it reimbursed outside vendors -- primarily three <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> advertising agencies -- for making illegal political contributions on its behalf. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Appleyard Agency</ORGANIZATION>, for example, allegedly made contributions from 1982 to 1984 to various funds for political candidates, then submitted bills to <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Power</ORGANIZATION>.
The contributions were funded by monthly payments of $1,000 to $2,000 to <ORGANIZATION>Appleyard</ORGANIZATION> in the guise of a "special production fee" -- in effect, hiding the nature of the payments from the <ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION>, federal prosecutors said. 
The government also indicated that former <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Power</ORGANIZATION> senior vice president <PERSON>Jacob F. "Jake" Horton</PERSON> was the mastermind behind the use of the ad agencies -- <ORGANIZATION>Appleyard</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Dick Leonard Group II Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Hemmer & Yates Corp.</ORGANIZATION> -- to make payments to various political candidates from 1981 to 1988.
<PERSON>Mr. Horton</PERSON>, who oversaw <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Power</ORGANIZATION>'s governmental-affairs efforts, died mysteriously in a plane crash in April after learning he might be fired following the uncovering of irregularities in a company audit. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> trading, <ORGANIZATION>Southern Co.</ORGANIZATION> rose 50 cents a share to $27.125. 
<ORGANIZATION>Banca Nazionale del Lavoro</ORGANIZATION> said its potential losses from lending to <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> could reach 1.175 trillion lire ($872 million), marking the bank's first quantification of potential costs of unauthorized lending by its <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> branch. 
<ORGANIZATION>BNL</ORGANIZATION> previously reported that its <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> branch had taken on loan commitments topping $3 billion without the Rome-based management's approval.
State-owned <ORGANIZATION>BNL</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s largest bank, has filed charges against the branch's former manager, <PERSON>Christopher Drogoul</PERSON>, and a former branch vice president, alleging fraud and breach of their fiduciary duties. 
<ORGANIZATION>BNL</ORGANIZATION> also said that its board had approved "after an in-depth discussion," a letter to the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Italy</ORGANIZATION> outlining measures the state-owned bank has taken or plans to take to improve controls on its foreign branches.
<ORGANIZATION>Bank of Italy</ORGANIZATION> has also ordered <ORGANIZATION>BNL</ORGANIZATION> to shore up its capital base to account for potential foreign loan losses, and the <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> bank has outlined a 3 trillion lire capital-raising operation. 
<PERSON>William A. Wise</PERSON>, 44 years old, president of the <ORGANIZATION>El Paso Natural Gas Co.</ORGANIZATION> unit of this energy and natural-resources concern, was named to the additional post of chief executive officer, succeeding <PERSON>Travis H. Petty</PERSON>, 61, who continues as a vice chairman of the parent. 
<PERSON>Sun Myung Moon</PERSON>, the Korean evangelist-industrialist who in 1954 founded the <ORGANIZATION>Unification Church</ORGANIZATION>, remains the mystery man behind a multimillion-dollar political and publishing operation based in this country and catering to the <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> right.
<PERSON>Mr. Moon</PERSON> planned to convert millions of Americans to his unique brand of Christianity -- in which he plays the role of Old Testament-style temporal, political messiah -- and then to make the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> part of a unified international theocracy.
More stable industries were to build an economically viable infrastructure for the <PERSON>Moon</PERSON> movement in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, as they had in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>.
But internal church documents clearly show that at its publicity-seeking heights, as when it organized a spectacular Yankee Stadium bicentennial rally in 1976, there actually were only about 2,000 full-time <ORGANIZATION>Unification Church</ORGANIZATION> members in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <PERSON>Mr. Moon</PERSON>'s support for a Watergate-beleaguered <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON>, the Koreagate scandal, and his prison sentence for income-tax evasion did not help the church's recruitment efforts.
Many of the enthusiastic young "Moonies" of the <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> era who remained faithful to Father <PERSON>Moon</PERSON> are now parents, producing new members by procreation rather than conversion. 
For a while in the 1970s it seemed <PERSON>Mr. Moon</PERSON> was on a spending spree, with such purchases as the former New Yorker Hotel and its adjacent <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> Center; a fishing/processing conglomerate with branches in <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>; a former <ORGANIZATION>Christian Brothers</ORGANIZATION> monastery and the <PERSON>Seagram</PERSON> family mansion (both picturesquely situated on the <LOCATION>Hudson River</LOCATION>); shares in banks from <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION>; a motion picture production company, and newspapers, such as the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Times, the <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> Tribune (originally the News World), and the successful Spanish-language Noticias del Mundo. 
Most were obtained with huge inputs of church money from <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, minimum cash downpayments and sizable mortgages.
Only his factories in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>, employing his followers at subsistence wages and producing everything from rifles to ginseng to expensive marble vases, kept the money flowing westward. 
<ORGANIZATION>Virginia Commonwealth University</ORGANIZATION> sociologist <PERSON>David Bromley</PERSON>, who more than any other researcher has delved into the complex world of Unificationist finances, has concluded that profitable operations in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> have been the exceptions rather than the rule.
Likewise, journalists <PERSON>John Burgess</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michael Isikoff</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post have estimated that at least $800 million was transferred from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> to deal with the church's annual operating losses in this country. 
<PERSON>Mr. Moon</PERSON>'s two English-language <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> newspapers illustrate the scope of this financial drain.
According to veteran watchers of Unificationist affairs, such as <PERSON>Dr. J. Gordon Melton</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Institute for the Study of American Religion</ORGANIZATION>, almost all operations are being drastically reduced as <PERSON>Mr. Moon</PERSON> now concentrates more on developing his empire in the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>. "Everything," one non-"Moonie" senior consultant to the <ORGANIZATION>Unification Church</ORGANIZATION> recently told me in an interview, "is going back to <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>." (<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> had proved even less hospitable than <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>.
So <PERSON>Mr. Moon</PERSON> is in retreat, refocusing on the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> continue to be profitable.
<PERSON>Moon</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Tong'Il</ORGANIZATION> industry conglomerate is now investing heavily in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, where church accountants have high hopes of expanding and attracting converts even in the wake of the bloody massacre in <LOCATION>Tiananmen Square</LOCATION>.
According to senior consultants to the church, <PERSON>Mr. Moon</PERSON> has successfully negotiated a joint venture with the Chinese government to build an automobile-parts plant in <LOCATION>Guangdong Province</LOCATION>, an area of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> with a substantial Korean minority.
<PERSON>Mr. Moon</PERSON> has agreed to put up $10 million a year for 25 years and keep the profits in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Shupe</PERSON> is co-author (with <PERSON>David G. Bromley</PERSON>) of "`<ORGANIZATION>Moonies</ORGANIZATION>' in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>: Cult, Church, and Crusade" and "Strange Gods: The Great American Cult Scare." 
In fact, he liberated the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> from one of the world's most corrupt organizations -- <ORGANIZATION>UNESCO</ORGANIZATION>.
Now <ORGANIZATION>UNESCO</ORGANIZATION> apologists are lobbying President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to renege on President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s decision to depart.
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, along with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>, left the agency when its anti-Western ideology, financial corruption and top leadership got out of hand.
The personal antics of agency Director <PERSON>Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow</PERSON> drew much attention, such as when several of his top aides were uncovered as <ORGANIZATION>KGB</ORGANIZATION> plants and ejected from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and when a mysterious office fire was set just before <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> sent accountants to trace <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> funds. 
<PERSON>Mr. M'Bow</PERSON> was an extreme case, but even his replacement, the more personally genial Spanish biochemist <PERSON>Federico Mayor</PERSON>, has had little success at achieving reforms.
<ORGANIZATION>UNESCO</ORGANIZATION> somehow converted the founding <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> ideals of individual rights and liberty into "peoples' rights." Million-dollar conferences were held to chew on subjects such as "ethical responsibilities of scientists in support of disarmament" and "the impact of the activities of transnational corporations." 
Glasnost may be partly responsible, but Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON>Eduard Shevardnadze</PERSON> last year admitted, "The exaggerated ideological approach undermined tolerance intrinsic to <ORGANIZATION>UNESCO</ORGANIZATION>." 
<ORGANIZATION>UNESCO</ORGANIZATION> is now holding its biennial meetings in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> to devise its next projects.
<PERSON>Mr. Mayor</PERSON>'s hope that references to "press freedom" would survive unamended seems doomed to failure; the current phrasing is "educating the public and media to avoid manipulation." He hasn't been able to replace the <PERSON>M'Bow</PERSON> cabal.
<PERSON>John Bolton</PERSON>, the assistant secretary of state for international organizations, told <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> that the continuing "statist, restrictive, nondemocratic" programs make rejoining any time soon "extremely unlikely." This hasn't much bothered the <ORGANIZATION>UNESCO</ORGANIZATION> delegates, who last week couldn't even agree to raise funds by selling off a fancy 19th-century French chateau the agency somehow owns.
This is that the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> Revolution spanning <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tiananmen Square</LOCATION> shows the power of ideas unencumbered by international civil servants or government functionaries.
<ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola Co.</ORGANIZATION>, aiming to boost soft-drink volume in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>, said it is discussing a joint venture with <ORGANIZATION>Fraser & Neave Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, its bottling franchisee in that country. 
So far this year, it has put nearly $700 million into bottling operations in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. 
The move also reflects <ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION>'s eagerness to have a hand in developing the soft-drink markets in <LOCATION>Pacific Basin</LOCATION> countries.
Aside from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> division is where <ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION> will be focusing much of its attention for years to come. 
That's because when <ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION> looks to the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> area, it sees an economic and demographic gold mine.
In countries such as <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>, economies are growing, resulting in a rise in disposable income that consumers can use for soft drinks.
And unlike <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, where populations are aging, the <LOCATION>Pacific Basin</LOCATION> countries have growing proportions of youths -- the heaviest consumers of Coca-Cola and other sodas. 
By acquiring stakes in bottling companies in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and overseas, <ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION> has been able to improve bottlers' efficiency and production, and in some cases, marketing.
That doesn't appear to be the case in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>, a country of about three million people with a relatively high soft-drink consumption rate -- a key indicator of <ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION>'s success in a market.
In <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>, per-capita consumption is about one-third that of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
And combining <ORGANIZATION>Fraser & Neave</ORGANIZATION>'s own soft drinks with <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola</ORGANIZATION>'s gives the <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> company more than half the share of the soda market there, <ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION> said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Fraser & Neave</ORGANIZATION>, which also has interests in packaging, beer and dairy products, holds the <ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION> licenses for <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, where per-capita consumption isn't as high as in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>.
The new "social choice" fund will shun securities of companies linked to <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, nuclear power and in some cases, <LOCATION>Northern Ireland</LOCATION>.
Everything looked good as neurosurgeon <PERSON>Walter Levy</PERSON> and colleagues carefully cut away a woman's spinal tumor at the <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Clinic</ORGANIZATION> in 1978. 
<PERSON>Dr. Levy</PERSON>'s answer may come with a new kind of magnetic brain probe, a device that he and dozens of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> researchers are studying with great hope.
"Until now, we've had no objective way of measuring motor function," says <PERSON>Keith Chiappa</PERSON>, a neurologist conducting clinical tests with the devices at <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts General Hospital</ORGANIZATION>. "All we could do was tell a patient, `squeeze my fingers as hard as you can' or `raise your arm. ' " Under the best circumstances such tests are subjective; when a patient is unconscious, they don't work at all. 
But for brain tests, the unwieldy machines "would have required patients to stand on their heads," says <PERSON>Reginald Bickford</PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. 
The field took off in 1985 after scientists at <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Sheffield University</ORGANIZATION> developed a handy, compact magnet for brain stimulation.
"We don't feel we can use {the devices} routinely in surgery yet, but we're getting close," says <PERSON>Dr. Levy</PERSON>, who is now with the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pittsburgh</ORGANIZATION>.
The devices could help indicate when surgery would help, says <PERSON>Charles Tator</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of Toronto</ORGANIZATION> neurosurgeon.
The main sensation, besides feeling like a puppet jerked with invisible strings, is "like a rap on the head," says <PERSON>Sam Bridgers</PERSON>, a neurologist who has studied the brain stimulators at <ORGANIZATION>Yale University</ORGANIZATION>.
At least two companies, <ORGANIZATION>Cadwell Laboratories Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Kennewick</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Novametrix Medical Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Wallingford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, now sell versions of the magnetic devices.

In a surprise move, the <ORGANIZATION>British government</ORGANIZATION> cleared the way for a bidding war for <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar PLC</ORGANIZATION> by agreeing to remove an obstacle to a takeover of the auto maker. 
Trade and Industry Secretary <PERSON>Nicholas Ridley</PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION>House of Commons</ORGANIZATION> yesterday that he will relinquish the government's so-called golden share in the company as long as <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shareholders agree.
It was in <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s best interests "for the company's future to be assured and the present climate of uncertainty resolved as quickly as possible," <PERSON>Mr. Ridley</PERSON> said. 
<PERSON>Mr. Ridley</PERSON>'s decision fires the starting pistol for perhaps a costly contest between the world's auto giants for <ORGANIZATION>Britain</ORGANIZATION>'s leading luxury-car maker.
Both <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> have been trying to amass 15% stakes in <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> has been negotiating a friendly transaction with <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> that likely would involve joint ventures and an eventual stake of just under 30%. 
But the government's action, which caught <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> management flat-footed, may scuttle the <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> minority deal by forcing it to fight for all of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>. "I can't believe they (<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>) will let <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> have a free run," said <PERSON>Stephen Reitman</PERSON>, a European auto industry analyst at <ORGANIZATION>UBS-Phillips & Drew</ORGANIZATION>. "I am sure they will be going for a full bid." 
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shares skyrocketed yesterday after <PERSON>Mr. Ridley</PERSON>'s announcement, following their temporary suspension on <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>.
In the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> over-the-counter market, <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shares trading as <ORGANIZATION>American Depositary</ORGANIZATION> Receipts closed at $13.625, up $1.75. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> is "in the driving seat at the moment," observed <PERSON>Bob Barber</PERSON>, an auto analyst at brokers <ORGANIZATION>James Capel & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
An aggressive <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> bid for <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> would put pressure on <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> to make a better offer as the British company's "white knight." Such a countermove could end <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s hopes for remaining independent and British-owned.
But it isn't clear how long <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> would be willing to fight <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>.
Because of their longstanding rivalry, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> just "wants to make sure <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> pays a huge packet for (<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>)," said <PERSON>John Lawson</PERSON>, an auto analyst at <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Nomura Research Institute</ORGANIZATION>. 
People close to the <ORGANIZATION>GM-Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> talks agreed that <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> now may be able to shut out <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION>. "It's either going to be a shootout, or there only may be one player in town," one person said.
In a statement, <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s board said they "were not consulted about the (<PERSON>Ridley</PERSON> decision) in advance and were surprised at the action taken." The statement emphasized that holders representing 75% of the shares voting at a special shareholders' meeting must agree to lift the takeover restrictions.
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> officials in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> noted that <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>, as <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder, now has the power to call for such a meeting. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auto analysts also noted that <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> is in the best position to benefit from the large number of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shares that have moved over the past month into the hands of arbitragers waiting for the highest takeover bid.
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> officials in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> declined to comment on the British government's action or on any plans to call a special <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shareholders meeting.
But <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> officials said they, too, were surprised by the move, which left them to "consider all our options and explore matters further." Although <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> has <ORGANIZATION>U.S.</ORGANIZATION> approval to buy up to 15% of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s stock, it hasn't yet disclosed how many shares it now owns. 
In a prepared statement, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> suggested its plans for <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> would be more valuable in the long run than the initial windfalls investors might reap from a hostile <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> bid. "Our intensive discussions with <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, at their invitation," <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> said, "have as their objectives to create a cooperative business relationship with <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> that would provide for the continued independence of this great British car company, to ensure a secure future for its employees and to provide an attractive long-term return for its shareholders." 
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> was shocked by <PERSON>Mr. Ridley</PERSON>'s decision, because management had believed the government wouldn't lift the golden share without consulting the company first. 
<PERSON>Mr. Ridley</PERSON>'s announcement set off a howl of protests from members of the opposition <ORGANIZATION>Labor Party</ORGANIZATION>, who accused the <PERSON>Thatcher</PERSON> administration of backing down on promised protection for a privatized company.
The Conservative government's decision may reflect its desire to shed a politically sensitive issue well before the next election, expected in late 1991. "It's now a very good time politically to get this over and done with," observed <PERSON>Daniel Jones</PERSON>, professor of motor industry management at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Cardiff</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION>.
At the same time, the government didn't want to appear to favor <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> by allowing a minority stake that might preclude a full bid by <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Ridley</PERSON> hinted at this motive in answering questions from members of <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> after his announcement.

Two of the 757-200s are new aircraft to be delivered to <ORGANIZATION>American Trans Air</ORGANIZATION>, the main subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Amtran Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, in December 1991 and January 1992.
Four of the planes were purchased by <ORGANIZATION>International Lease</ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION>Singapore Airlines</ORGANIZATION> in a previously announced transaction. 
<ORGANIZATION>Chez Panisse</ORGANIZATION>, whose founder, <PERSON>Alice Waters</PERSON>, is considered the inventor of the cooking style known as <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> cuisine and whose patrons make reservations a month in advance, hasn't exactly subjected diners to vanilla ice cream because of the theft.
For one thing, <PERSON>Ms. Shere</PERSON> can draw on her cookbook, published by <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> four years ago, which is teeming with recipes for such specialties as kiwi sherbet, gooseberry fool (a creamy dish made with crushed stewed berries) and hazelnut "oeufs a la neige." For another, sympathetic fans have sent <PERSON>Ms. Shere</PERSON> copies of her recipes clipped from magazines over the years. 
And that puts added pressure on <ORGANIZATION>Chez Panisse</ORGANIZATION> dessert-menu planners. "We make what we know how to make," says business manager <PERSON>Richard Mazzera</PERSON>. 
Many in the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>'s pastry community express disbelief that <PERSON>Ms. Shere</PERSON> kept only one copy of such valuable notes, but she has received moral support from <ORGANIZATION>Baker's Dozen</ORGANIZATION>, a group of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> pastry chefs that meets regularly to discuss issues like how to keep meringues from weeping and how bovine eating habits affect butter texture. 
<ORGANIZATION>Mips Computer Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION> today will unveil a new general-purpose computer that will compete with more expensive machines from companies such as <ORGANIZATION>Sun Microsystems Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
The closely held <LOCATION>Sunnyvale</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, company also will announce an agreement to supply computers to <ORGANIZATION>Control Data Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which will sell <ORGANIZATION>Mips</ORGANIZATION> machines under its own label. 
At that price, an analyst familiar with the machine said, the computer offers up to 10 times the performance of similar machines. "In the price range it's a tremendously high-performing product," said <PERSON>Sandy Gant</PERSON>, an analyst at the market-research firm <ORGANIZATION>InfoCorp.</ORGANIZATION> 
<ORGANIZATION>Mips</ORGANIZATION> also wants to wedge into markets other than traditional RISC applications such as engineering; <ORGANIZATION>Mips</ORGANIZATION> said the new machine will also be used by businesses and for communications. "This clearly demonstrates that <ORGANIZATION>Mips</ORGANIZATION> is a systems company rather than just a chip company," said <ORGANIZATION>Mips</ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON>John Hime</PERSON>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Control Data</ORGANIZATION> deal is a boon for <ORGANIZATION>Mips</ORGANIZATION> because it gives the the five-year-old company one more ally as it battles more established electronic concerns such as <ORGANIZATION>Sun</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Motorola Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Intel Corp.</ORGANIZATION> for the emerging market for RISC machines.
For <ORGANIZATION>Mips</ORGANIZATION>, which expects revenue of $100 million this year, big-name allies such as <ORGANIZATION>Control Data</ORGANIZATION> are essential to attract software developers to the company's RISC architecture. "The thing it says about <ORGANIZATION>Mips</ORGANIZATION> is that they're on a roll right now," said <PERSON>Ms. Gant</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>InfoCorp</ORGANIZATION>. "They're getting some major wins," she added. 
Last month, for example, <ORGANIZATION>Mips</ORGANIZATION> agreed to supply its computers to <ORGANIZATION>Nixdorf Computer AG</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Groupe Bull</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Tandem Computers Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment</ORGANIZATION> have agreed to sell <ORGANIZATION>MIPS</ORGANIZATION> computers and companies such as <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>NEC Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Siemens A.G.</ORGANIZATION> have agreed to make <ORGANIZATION>Mips</ORGANIZATION> chips under license. 
Today's agreement gives <ORGANIZATION>Control Data</ORGANIZATION> a machine to compete against <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION> and other general-purpose computer makers, said <PERSON>John Logan</PERSON>, a computer-market analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Aberdeen Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>.
The machine is essentially a mainframe computer, he said. "Suddenly <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Control Data</ORGANIZATION>) has a competitive product to fight back against the VAX9000," a machine <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION> announced last month, he added. 
<ORGANIZATION>Control Data</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minn.</LOCATION>, expects its sales of <ORGANIZATION>Mips</ORGANIZATION> systems, including the new RC6280, to amount to more than $100 million by the end of 1991, <ORGANIZATION>Mips</ORGANIZATION> said.
<ORGANIZATION>Nixdorf</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Bull</ORGANIZATION> and others will also sell versions of the machine, said <ORGANIZATION>Mips</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Robert Miller</PERSON>. 
Records said it agreed to form a recorded-music and music-publishing joint venture with former <ORGANIZATION>MCA Records</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Irving Azoff</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Azoff</PERSON> hasn't named the company yet, but any records it produces will be distributed by <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> is part of <ORGANIZATION>Warner Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which is in the process of being acquired by <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Azoff</PERSON> resigned as head of <ORGANIZATION>MCA Records</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>MCA Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, in September, and had been discussing a joint venture with both <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION>.
In a statement yesterday, <PERSON>Mr. Azoff</PERSON> said he chose <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>, the largest record company, because "their standing in the entertainment industry is second to none." 
In an Oct. 19 review of "The Misanthrope" at <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s Goodman Theatre ("Revitalized Classics Take the Stage in Windy City," Leisure & Arts), the role of <PERSON>Celimene</PERSON>, played by <PERSON>Kim Cattrall</PERSON>, was mistakenly attributed to <PERSON>Christina Haag</PERSON>.

<ORGANIZATION>Northwest</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>NWA Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which made the MD-80 aircraft, also are pursuing counterclaims against each other in the crash near <LOCATION>Detroit Metropolitan Airport</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Julian A. Cook Jr.</PERSON> announced the settlements as the jury trial was to begin yesterday.
The jury will resolve the claims against <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Northwest</ORGANIZATION>'s claim that a defect in the aircraft caused the crash, and <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas</ORGANIZATION>' claim that the plane was improperly flown. 
The only passenger who survived the crash was <PERSON>Cecelia Cichan</PERSON>, then 4, of <LOCATION>Tempe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, whose parents and brother died in the crash.
The <LOCATION>Wellesley</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, maker of scientific instruments and electronic parts said <ORGANIZATION>Berthold</ORGANIZATION> expects 1989 sales of more than 100 million Deutsche marks ($54.5 million) and employs about 400 people.
<ORGANIZATION>Berthold</ORGANIZATION> is based in <LOCATION>Wildbad</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, and also has operations in <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>John M. Kucharski</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>EG&G</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, said the acquisition "will extend <ORGANIZATION>EG&G</ORGANIZATION>'s core technologies, strengthen its position in the <ORGANIZATION>European Economic Community</ORGANIZATION> and assure a strength and presence in the Eastern European market." He said it especially will strengthen the company's efforts in the rapidly growing field of bio-analytical instrumentation, and in applied nuclear physics. 
Separately, <ORGANIZATION>EG&G</ORGANIZATION> said it sold most of its <ORGANIZATION>Mason Research Institute</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary to <ORGANIZATION>Transgenic Sciences Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a closely held biotechnology company based in <LOCATION>Worcester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>.
The sale, for $7 million in cash and securities, will leave <ORGANIZATION>EG&G</ORGANIZATION> with a 12% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Transgenic</ORGANIZATION>, executives said.
<ORGANIZATION>Mason</ORGANIZATION> is the largest toxicology lab in <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>, with annual revenue of $8 million and 140 employees.

The combined companies will become profitable by January 1990, said <PERSON>James P. Sherblom</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Transgenic</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer. 
The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> approved a provision, dubbed the "two-time loser amendment" by its supporters, apparently aimed at preventing <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON> from acquiring another airline. 
The amendment, offered by Rep. <PERSON>Douglas Bosco</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>), was approved 283-132 during debate on a bill designed to strengthen the <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION>'s authority in dealing with leveraged buy-outs of airlines. 
In 1983, <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy.
Earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy. 
"This ought to be subtitled the `Don't let <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON> take over another airline' amendment," said Rep. <PERSON>James Oberstar</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Minn.</LOCATION>), chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> aviation subcommittee, who argued that the provision was unnecessary because the bill already would give the department ample power to block undesirable deals. 
<ORGANIZATION>Alltel Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it will acquire the 55% of <ORGANIZATION>Pond Branch Telephone Company Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's cellular franchise that it doesn't own already.
<ORGANIZATION>Alltel</ORGANIZATION> holds 45% of the franchise, which has operations in <LOCATION>Aiken</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Augusta</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Dataproducts</ORGANIZATION> is fighting a hostile tender offer by <ORGANIZATION>DPC Acquisition Partners</ORGANIZATION>, a group led by New York-based <ORGANIZATION>Crescott Investments Associates</ORGANIZATION>.

The average one-year savings-type CD was down to 7.99% from 8.01%, according to <ORGANIZATION>Banxquote Money Markets</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> information service that tracks CD yields. 
"This week was uneventful for the CD market," said <PERSON>Norberto Mehl</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Banxquote</ORGANIZATION>. "The major banks haven't even reacted to sharp rises in the three-month <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bill rates" in the past two weeks.
<PERSON>Mr. Mehl</PERSON> attributed the rise specifically to the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bill increase. 
It is offered by the flagship banks of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Manufacturers Hanover Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in the one-year maturity only.
The yield is offered across a range of maturities at <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>BankAmerica Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Wells Fargo & Co</ORGANIZATION>.
Still, on average, the major <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> banks have the highest yields on CDs, according to <ORGANIZATION>Banxquote</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>J.C. PENNEY Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, said it issued $350 million of securities backed by credit-card receivables.
The retailer said the securities are expected to be rated triple-A by <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor's Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and Aaa by <ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
As part of the transaction, <ORGANIZATION>J.C. Penney</ORGANIZATION> will sell a portion of its credit-card receivables to its <ORGANIZATION>JCP Receivables Inc.</ORGANIZATION> unit, which will then transfer them to a master trust.
Credit support will be provided by a letter of credit facility from <ORGANIZATION>Credit Suisse</ORGANIZATION> in favor of the trustee, <ORGANIZATION>Fuji Bank & Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION>, for the benefit of the certificate holders.
Courts have ruled that taxpayers must submit to <ORGANIZATION>TCMP</ORGANIZATION> audits, but the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> will excuse from the fullscale rigors anyone who was audited without change for either 1986 or 1987. 
<PERSON>Sen. Pryor</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>), a leader on the issue who generally backs the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> plan, wants some changes -- for one, separate sanctions for negligence and large misstatements of tax owed, not a single penalty.
The <ORGANIZATION>General Accounting Office</ORGANIZATION> urges <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to ensure that all penalties retain their force as deterrents. 
In 1989, <ORGANIZATION>Illinois</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Kansas</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Oregon</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>South Carolina</ORGANIZATION> have adopted rights laws, the <ORGANIZATION>Federation of Tax Administrators</ORGANIZATION>, a state officials' group, reports; the features vary.
One group is the <ORGANIZATION>Committee on State Taxation</ORGANIZATION>, which comprises 330 multistate corporations and advises the <ORGANIZATION>Council of State Chambers of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>.
The group's <PERSON>Mark Cahoon</PERSON> says its efforts begun in 1989 have led to the introduction of bills in <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> to establish evenhanded procedures affecting all kinds of taxpayers.

BRIEFS: The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> already is doing intensive <ORGANIZATION>TCMP</ORGANIZATION> audits of 19,000 returns for 1987 and fiscal 1988 filed by corporations with under $10 million in assets. . . . President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> says he will name <PERSON>Donald E.

<ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it lowered the ratings on about $3.2 billion of <ORGANIZATION>Houston Lighting & Power Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's securities because of the company's low levels of interest coverage and internal cash generation. 
<ORGANIZATION>Houston Lighting</ORGANIZATION> is a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Houston Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a utility holding company in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>. 
Downgraded by <ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION>'s were <ORGANIZATION>Houston Lighting</ORGANIZATION>'s first-mortgage bonds and secured pollution-control bonds to single-A-3 from single-A-2; unsecured pollution-control bonds to Baa-1 from single-A-3; preferred stock to single-A-3 from single-A-2; a shelf registration for preferred stock to a preliminary rating of single-A-3 from a preliminary rating of single-A-2; two shelf registrations for collateralized debt securities to a preliminary rating of single-A-3 from a preliminary rating of single-A-2, and the unit's rating for commercial paper to Prime-2 from Prime-1. 
<ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION>'s said <ORGANIZATION>Houston Lighting</ORGANIZATION>'s current situation has some positive aspects, including managing "very well" the construction and commercial operation risks of Units 1 and 2 of the <LOCATION>South Texas</LOCATION> Project nuclear power plant.
<ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said it is examining the ruling to determine if it can appeal. 
It's unclear whether <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> will succeed in overturning the arbitrator's decision, made in a long-simmering "pay parity" dispute that predates both the carrier's Chapter 11 petition and its 1986 acquisition by <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>.
That may leave a lot of leeway for <ORGANIZATION>U.S.</ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy <PERSON>Judge Burton R. Lifland</PERSON> to decide what, if anything, the pilots actually collect.
<PERSON>James Linsey</PERSON>, a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION>Air Line Pilots Association</ORGANIZATION>, said the pilots were extremely pleased. "This is a blow not only to <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> but to the creditors committee," he said. 
Shortly after <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> took control of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>, some <ORGANIZATION>Machinists</ORGANIZATION> union supervisors received a 20% pay raise.
<ORGANIZATION>Columbia Pictures</ORGANIZATION> is being acquired by <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
Some <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> allies are complaining that President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is pushing conventional-arms talks too quickly, creating a risk that negotiators will make errors that could affect the security of <LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION> for years. 
Concerns about the pace of the <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION> talks -- which are aimed at the destruction of some 100,000 weapons, as well as major reductions and realignments of troops in <LOCATION>central Europe</LOCATION> -- also are being registered at the Pentagon.
For one thing, <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> officials, who asked not to be identified, worry that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> will have a much tougher time persuading Europeans to keep some short-range nuclear weapons on their soil once Soviet armored forces are thinned out.
At the same time, they contend that a reduction of <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> forces under a treaty will increase the possibility of a conventional Soviet attack unless the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> retains a residual force of nuclear weapons in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 
So far, no ally has complained openly, preserving the impression that <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> is in line with the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> position that a quick agreement bringing Soviet conventional forces down to parity with <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> is the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>'s top bargaining priority. 
But even though <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> negotiators have only 10 months left under the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> timetable, they are still wrestling over such seemingly fundamental questions as "What is a tank?" Five of the six categories of weapons under negotiation haven't even been defined. 
<PERSON>Oleg A. Grinevsky</PERSON>, the chief Soviet negotiator in the conventional-arms talks, argued that this would mean the Soviets would have to destroy some 1,800 tanks, while the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> would lose none because it has no light tanks in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> all have light tanks they would like to keep out of the talks.
And some <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> analysts worry that the proposed Soviet redefinition is aimed at blocking the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> from developing lighter, more transportable, high-technology tanks. 
The dispute over that issue, according to one <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official, is a "potential treaty stopper," and only President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON> may be able to resolve it. 
<LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION>, for example, are suspected of overstating their arsenals in hopes that they can emerge from the arms-reduction treaty with large remaining forces to deter each other. 
Other nations aren't sure how many weapons they have in their own arsenals. "It's just going to be sloppy, both on our side and theirs {the <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION> Pact's}," says one <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> analyst. 
So far, neither the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration nor arms-control experts in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> seem moved by arguments that these problems may take more time to thrash out than President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has allowed.
"So what if you miss 50 tanks somewhere?" asks Rep. <PERSON>Norman Dicks</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>), a member of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> group that visited the talks in <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION>. "The bottom line is that if we can get that {<ORGANIZATION>Warsaw Pact</ORGANIZATION>} superiority brought down to parity, we ought to keep pressing ahead as quickly as possible.
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> shares also rose, while trading in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, ended higher. 
In <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Nikkei</ORGANIZATION> index of 225 selected issues was up 132.00 points to 35549.44.
An official at <ORGANIZATION>Wako Securities</ORGANIZATION> said these investors feel the need to make quick profits, despite destabilizing external factors, such as political uncertainty tied to the ruling party's fate at next year's <ORGANIZATION>Lower House</ORGANIZATION> elections-an event which could directly affect the stock market. 
The <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the <ORGANIZATION>First Section</ORGANIZATION>, which declined 5.16 on Monday, was up 16.05, or 0.60%, at 2692.65 on Tuesday.

In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, prices finished at intraday peaks, comforted by a reassuring early performance on Wall Street and news that the British government will waive its "golden share" in auto maker <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>.
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry <PERSON>Nicholas Ridley</PERSON> said later in the day that the government would abolish its golden share in <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, the luxury auto maker being stalked by <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor</ORGANIZATION>. 
As the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> trading session drew to a close, the market was still listening to the parliamentary debate on the economy, with new Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON>John Major</PERSON> expected to clarify his approach to the British economy and currency issues. 
Contributing to the market's reserved stance was the release later in the day of new data on the health of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economy, in the form of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> index of leading indicators.

The crowning moment in the career of <PERSON>Joseph F. O'Kicki</PERSON> came as 300 local and state dignitaries packed into his elegant, marble-columned courtroom here last year for his swearing in as President Judge of <LOCATION>Cambria County</LOCATION>. 
Last March, nine months after the judge's swearing-in, the state attorney general's office indicted him on a sweeping array of charges alleging more than 10 years of "official oppression" in <LOCATION>Cambria County</LOCATION>, a depressed steel and mining community in western <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>.
Fear of alienating that judge is pervasive, says <PERSON>Maurice Geiger</PERSON>, founder and director of the <ORGANIZATION>Rural Justice Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Montpelier</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Vt.</LOCATION>, a public interest group that researches rural justice issues. 
The son of an immigrant stonemason of Slovenian descent, he was raised in a small borough outside <LOCATION>Ebensburg</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Cambria County</LOCATION> seat, and put himself through the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pittsburgh Law School</ORGANIZATION>.
He graduated near the top of his class, serving on the school law review with <PERSON>Richard Thornburgh</PERSON>, who went on to become governor of <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and, now, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Attorney General.
Last year, <ORGANIZATION>Pennsylvania Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON>John P. Flaherty</PERSON> called <PERSON>Mr. O'Kicki</PERSON> one of the finest judges "not only in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> but in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>." Clearly, the judge has had his share of accomplishments.
Six years ago, <PERSON>Judge O'Kicki</PERSON> was voted president of the <ORGANIZATION>Pennsylvania Conference of State Trial Judges</ORGANIZATION> by the state's 400 judges.
"He probably was the smartest guy who ever sat on our bench," says a former president of <LOCATION>Cambria County</LOCATION>'s 150-member bar association, who, like most lawyers in <LOCATION>Cambria County</LOCATION>, refuses to talk about the judge publicly. "He's sharp as a tack.
For more than a decade, virtually no one complained about <PERSON>Judge O'Kicki</PERSON>. "What about those institutions that are supposed to be the bedrock of society, the banks and the bar association. . . ?" wrote a columnist for the Tribune-Democrat, a newspaper in nearby <LOCATION>Johnstown</LOCATION>, shortly after the scandal became public. "If only a banker or a lawyer had spoken out years ago, the judicial process wouldn't be under the taint it is today." 
Officials with the <ORGANIZATION>Pennsylvania Judicial Inquiry and Review Board</ORGANIZATION>, the arm of the state that investigates judicial misconduct, counter that they had no inkling of anything amiss in <LOCATION>Ebensburg</LOCATION>. "Nobody told us; nobody called us," says an official close to the case who asked not to be named. "Nobody had the guts to complain." 
<LOCATION>Johnstown</LOCATION> attorney <PERSON>Richard J. Green Jr.</PERSON> shelled out $500 in loans to the judge over five years, he said in testimony to the grand jury. "The judge never made a pretense of repaying the money," said <PERSON>Mr. Green</PERSON>.
When <PERSON>Mr. Green</PERSON> won a $240,000 verdict in a land condemnation case against the state in June 1983, he says <PERSON>Judge O'Kicki</PERSON> unexpectedly awarded him an additional $100,000.
<PERSON>Mr. O'Kicki</PERSON> said he will respond to <PERSON>Mr. Green</PERSON>'s allegation at his trial. 
Like most of <LOCATION>Cambria County</LOCATION>'s lawyers and residents who had dealings with the judge, <PERSON>Mr. Green</PERSON> declined to be interviewed for this article.
"My name is judge," <PERSON>Judge O'Kicki</PERSON> told a car salesman in <LOCATION>Ebensburg</LOCATION> when he bought a new red Pontiac Sunbird in October 1984, according to the grand-jury report.
Yet, despite the judge's imperial bearing, no one ever had reason to suspect possible wrongdoing, says <PERSON>John Bognato</PERSON>, president of <LOCATION>Cambria County</LOCATION>'s 150-member bar association. 
When the judge bought his new Sunbird from <PERSON>James E. Black Pontiac-Cadillac</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Ebensburg</LOCATION> five years ago, the dealership had "certain apprehensions" about the judge's reputation, according to the grand-jury report.
The dealership took the extra step of having all the paper work for the transaction pre-approved by <LOCATION>Ebensburg</LOCATION>'s local lender, <ORGANIZATION>Laurel Bank</ORGANIZATION>. 
"I find myself in an adversary relationship with <ORGANIZATION>Laurel Bank</ORGANIZATION>, and I am not inclined to extend myself as far as any favors are concerned," the judge wrote back in a letter attached to the grand jury's report. "Perhaps if my personal matters can be resolved with <ORGANIZATION>Laurel bank</ORGANIZATION> in the near future, I may be inclined to reconsider your request. . . ." The judge now says it was "unfortunate" that he chose to write the letter but says "there was certainly no intent to extort there." 
Two years later, he wrote to complain that the interest he was paying on an unsecured $10,000 loan was "absolutely onerous." <PERSON>Paul L. Kane</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Laurel</ORGANIZATION>'s president at the time, quickly responded.
Unfortunately, according to <PERSON>Webster</PERSON>'s Biographical Dictionary, "His policies went beyond his control and resulted . . . in riots and disturbances" and later a renewed campaign of civil disobedience "resulted in rioting and a second imprisonment." I am not a proponent of everything <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> did, but some of his law breaking was justified because <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> was then under occupation by a foreign power, and Indians were not able to participate fully in decisions that vitally affected them. 
<PERSON>Geraldo</PERSON> or <PERSON>Phil</PERSON> would probably pull up another camera and interview the chained protesters.
I am referring to those young men who chose to disobey their country's call to arms during the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> war and fled to <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> or some other sanctuary to avoid combat.
It is amazing that the ensuing mass executions in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION> do not weight more heavily on minds so morally fine-tuned.
Worse, it remained to a well-meaning but naive president of the <ORGANIZATION>United States</ORGANIZATION> to administer the final infamy upon those who fought and died in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. 
Under the guise of "healing the wounds of the nation," President <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> pardoned thousands of draft evaders, thus giving dignity to their allegations of the war's "immorality." The precedent having been set, who can complain if future generations called upon to defend the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> yield to the temptation to avoid the danger of combat by simply declaring the war immoral and hiding until it is over?

After a flat second quarter tied largely to lower newsprint earnings, <ORGANIZATION>Kimberly-Clark</ORGANIZATION> attributed the gain to improved results in its consumer businesses in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>.

Prime Minister <PERSON>Lee Kuan Yew</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>'s leader and one of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>'s leading statesmen for 30 years, recently announced his intention to retire next year -- though not necessarily to end his influence.
The 66-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Lee</PERSON> recently spent an hour discussing the state of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and the world with two Journal reporters in his plainly furnished, wood-paneled office.
Skipping personal pleasantries, <PERSON>Mr. Lee</PERSON> picked up exactly where he left off several months earlier -- before the government crackdown in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> -- when he had warned that the orthodox leadership in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> feared a plurality of views.
On <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s turmoil: "It is a very unhappy scene," he said. "It took <PERSON>Zhao Ziyang</PERSON> (former premier and party chief) 10 years to build a team of economists who understood how the Western economies work and now that team is part in exile, part being rusticated and part missing." Rebuilding that team, <PERSON>Mr. Lee</PERSON> predicted, will take another 10 years. "That's very sad for <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and for <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> because <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> could have been a good engine for growth, not just for <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> but for <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> and the rest of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>." 
On similarities between <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>: "In important particulars, the Soviets are different from the Chinese.
Asked if the Soviets, like Chinese officials, won't one day face a similar conflict between the desire to liberalize economically and yet retain political control, <PERSON>Mr. Lee</PERSON> said, "I would think that the Soviets face a deeper dilemma because they have been more in blinkers than the Chinese -- I mean keeping their people cut off from the outside world." <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON>, he said, is ahead of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s leaders in his awareness of the world. "But I think the Soviet peoples are more introverted than the Chinese." Regardless, he said, he still believes the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, while falling far short of the efficiency of a Western economy, may well manage to improve considerably. 
On Asia-Pacific prosperity: "If <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> can keep up the present situation -- her markets open for another 15 years, with adjustments, and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> can grow and not cut back, and so too, <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>ASEAN</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> -- then in 15 years, the economies of these countries would be totally restructured to be able to almost sustain growth by themselves." In such an arrangement, "all benefit," he said. "And if the Europeans come in, they benefit too.
Asked about the possibility of greater economic cooperation among Asia-Pacific nations, which will be discussed Nov. 6 and 7 at a ministerial meeting in <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Lee</PERSON> said the goal "is to have a free and open world trading system." An Asian bloc isn't intended, he said. "That's not possible." 
Commerce Secretary <PERSON>Robert</PERSON>} <PERSON>Mosbacher</PERSON> and {<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
I believe the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is becoming more patient and circumspect," he said. "It's the total relationship that is important." The total relationship, as <PERSON>Mr. Lee</PERSON> sees it, is "the flow of dollars to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> to fund the deficits, the investments the Japanese are making in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in order to satisfy American demand that American products consumed in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> should be made as much as possible in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> by Americans with Japanese technology and capital." 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s recent political turbulence, <PERSON>Mr. Lee</PERSON> said, may mean <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> will slow market adjustments. "They'll be more timorous in tackling their own voters, like opening up more to agricultural imports from <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, hurting their farmers." 
On <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military presence in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>: Asked if his offer to allow the American military to use facilities in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> would help preserve <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s presence in the region at bases in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, he said, "What we have done is make it easier for the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> to continue to host American bases without it being said they are lackeys of the imperialists and the only ones in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> or in <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION>.
The occasional Englishman tries to put on airs but we let it pass. . . . It's just comic when they try to pretend they're still the master race." <PERSON>Mr. Lee</PERSON> added that the Filipinos are "making it very difficult" for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military presence to last beyond five or 10 years. 
On economic consequences of a diminished <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> presence: "<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is the only major power in recent history that has used its military might to sustain a system that enables all participants to equally benefit without her as the provider of the security taking royalties." Asked why so few nations seem to share his views of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, he said, "Many people see it that way.
On <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION>: "Let's assume that {former Cambodian leader Prince <PERSON>Norodom</PERSON>} <PERSON>Sihanouk</PERSON> does what the press wants him to do and joins up with {Vietnamese-backed Cambodian leader} <PERSON>Hun Sen.</PERSON>
Can <PERSON>Sihanouk</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hun Sen</PERSON> knock off the <ORGANIZATION>Khmer Rouge</ORGANIZATION> still supported by <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>?
<PERSON>Ms. House</PERSON> is vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones International Group</ORGANIZATION>.
Buying 51% of <ORGANIZATION>Rockefeller Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> is right up <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Estate Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's alley in one sense: The huge Japanese real estate company is entering a long-term relationship with a similarly conservative <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> owner of tony urban property. 
The usually cautious giant will become the majority owner of the company that owns <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s beloved Rockefeller Center at a time when tensions over Japanese purchases of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> property are at an all-time high. 
Officials of <ORGANIZATION>Rockefeller Group</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Estate</ORGANIZATION> prefer to focus on the affinities, nearly dismissing the threat of a backlash from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> public. "We think there will be positive as well as negative reactions," says <PERSON>Raymond Pettit</PERSON>, senior vice president and chief financial officer of <ORGANIZATION>Rockefeller Group</ORGANIZATION>. "On balance, we think it will be positive." 
In particular, they criticize the timing, coming as it does on the heels of <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's controversial purchase of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
Since the mid-1980s, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s other major real estate purchases in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> include <ORGANIZATION>Dai-Ichi Seimei America Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's $670 million purchase of an office building at 153 East 53rd St. in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> in 1987 and <ORGANIZATION>Mitsui Fudosan Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's $610 million purchase of the Exxon Building, part of Rockefeller Center, in 1986.
In <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, Arco Plaza was sold to <ORGANIZATION>Shuwa Corp.</ORGANIZATION> for $620 million in 1986, and <ORGANIZATION>Sumitomo Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> paid $300 million for <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>'s IBM Tower last year. 
First of all, it is a friendly acquisition in which <ORGANIZATION>Rockefeller</ORGANIZATION> sought out <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Estate</ORGANIZATION> and asked it to buy a majority share.
Finally, <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Estate</ORGANIZATION> has no plans to interfere with <ORGANIZATION>Rockefeller</ORGANIZATION>'s management beyond taking a place on the board. 
"We'll continue to work with them, in keeping with the reputation of the company, and we'll rely very much on their leadership," says <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Estate</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Jotaro Takagi</PERSON>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Rockefeller</ORGANIZATION> may well have found its match in <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Estate</ORGANIZATION>, a company of long history, strong government ties and sound resources.
In asset terms, <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Estate</ORGANIZATION> is the largest real estate firm in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
The core of its holdings is 190,000 square meters of incredibly expensive property in the <LOCATION>Marunouchi</LOCATION> district, the business and financial center of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, often jokingly called "Mitsubishi Village." 
<ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi</ORGANIZATION> built the government's dream development, the story goes, in exchange for the official decision to locate <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s central railway station there. 
<ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Estate</ORGANIZATION> is one of the dozens of companies in today's <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi</ORGANIZATION> group.
Its earnings can rise 10% to 12% annually simply from the natural turnover of tenants and automatic rent increases, says <PERSON>Graeme McDonald</PERSON>, an industry analyst at <ORGANIZATION>James Capel Pacific Ltd</ORGANIZATION>.
For <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Estate</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Rockefeller</ORGANIZATION> purchase will catapult it firmly into the overseas real estate business, the one area where it has lagged notably behind Japanese competitors such as <ORGANIZATION>Mitsui</ORGANIZATION>, which had purchased the Exxon Building. 
"Japanese companies need to invest in overseas real estate for diversification," says <PERSON>Yoshio Shima</PERSON>, an industry analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs (Japan) Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Rockefeller</ORGANIZATION> isn't the first overseas purchase for <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Estate</ORGANIZATION> -- it has already played a leading role in designing <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp Plaza</ORGANIZATION>.
Moreover, as a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi</ORGANIZATION> group, which is headed by one of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s largest banks, it is sure to win a favorable loan.
It is the largest private-sector landowner of the Minato-Mirai 21 project, a multibillion-yen development in the port city of <LOCATION>Yokohama</LOCATION>, about an hour outside <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>.
A bitter conflict with global implications has erupted between <ORGANIZATION>Nomura Securities Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Industrial Bank of Japan</ORGANIZATION>, two of the world's most powerful financial companies. 
<ORGANIZATION>Nomura</ORGANIZATION> was attempting to organize the 50 billion-yen ($352 million) borrowing in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> at a time when many Japanese banks, led by <ORGANIZATION>Industrial Bank of Japan</ORGANIZATION>, were pressuring the <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION> government to help them recover loans made to a defunct investment bank that had been owned by <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>'s civil-service pension fund.
Unwilling to put up new money for <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> until those debts are repaid, most banks refused even to play administrative roles in the new financing, forcing an embarrassed <ORGANIZATION>Nomura</ORGANIZATION> to postpone it this week. 
Aside from <ORGANIZATION>Nomura</ORGANIZATION>'s injured pride, the biggest victim so far has been the <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> government. 
Barred by its budget law from making any new domestic bond issues, <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Debt Management Office</ORGANIZATION> had been casting abroad to raise the 3 billion New Zealand dollars (US$1.76 billion) to NZ$4 billion it needs to come up with by the end of its fiscal year next June 30.
Not only can they block <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION> from raising money in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, bankers here say, but as the largest underwriters in the Eurobond market, they might be able to scuttle borrowings there, too. 
<LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>'s finance minister, <PERSON>David Caygill</PERSON>, lashed out at such suggestions.
He told reporters in <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION> Tuesday that the government hadn't guaranteed the loans to <ORGANIZATION>DFC New Zealand Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, an investment bank 80%-owned by the National Provident Fund, and wouldn't bail it out. 
<ORGANIZATION>Nomura</ORGANIZATION>, the world's biggest securities company largely by virtue of its protected home field, and <ORGANIZATION>Industrial Bank of Japan</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s most innovative and aggressive bank in capital markets abroad, captain the opposing sides.
<ORGANIZATION>Nomura</ORGANIZATION> started a credit-card venture with <ORGANIZATION>American Express Co.</ORGANIZATION> that allowed cardholders to use their <ORGANIZATION>Nomura</ORGANIZATION> securities accounts like a bank account, attracting the wrath of banks.
And <ORGANIZATION>Industrial Bank of Japan</ORGANIZATION> started up a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> securities subsidiary that sells Japanese stocks to non-Japanese institutions overseas, a move that stirred the anger of the stock brokerage firms.
<ORGANIZATION>Healthcare International Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it reached a 120-day standstill agreement with its <ORGANIZATION>HealthVest</ORGANIZATION> affiliate calling for <ORGANIZATION>Healthcare</ORGANIZATION> to pay <ORGANIZATION>HealthVest</ORGANIZATION> $5 million right away and additional amounts in the future. 
Under the agreement, <ORGANIZATION>Healthcare</ORGANIZATION>, a manager of health-care facilities, said it would pay <ORGANIZATION>HealthVest</ORGANIZATION> $3.9 million in overdue rent and mortgage payments and repay $1.1 million in funds that <ORGANIZATION>HealthVest</ORGANIZATION> advanced for construction work on facilities.
In return, <ORGANIZATION>HealthVest</ORGANIZATION> agreed that it won't exercise its rights and remedies against <ORGANIZATION>Healthcare</ORGANIZATION> during the 120-day period. 
After the payment, <ORGANIZATION>Healthcare</ORGANIZATION> still will be $6.5 million in arrears on rent and mortgage payments to <ORGANIZATION>HealthVest</ORGANIZATION>, a real estate investment trust whose portfolio consists largely of properties operated by <ORGANIZATION>Healthcare</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Healthcare</ORGANIZATION> has given <ORGANIZATION>HealthVest</ORGANIZATION> a 12% note for that overdue amount, to be repaid over three years. 
In addition, <ORGANIZATION>Healthcare</ORGANIZATION> agreed to make monthly rent and mortgage payments of $2.7 million to $3 million to <ORGANIZATION>HealthVest</ORGANIZATION> during the standstill period, to be paid when <ORGANIZATION>Healthcare</ORGANIZATION> successfully completes asset sales.
Because <ORGANIZATION>Healthcare</ORGANIZATION> actually owes <ORGANIZATION>HealthVest</ORGANIZATION> $4.2 million in rent and mortgage payments each month, the amount due above the amount paid will be added to the three-year note. 
The funds should help ease a cash bind at <ORGANIZATION>HealthVest</ORGANIZATION>, which has been unable to pay its debts because <ORGANIZATION>Healthcare</ORGANIZATION> hasn't made complete rent and mortgage payments since July.
<ORGANIZATION>Healthcare</ORGANIZATION>, which has been in a severe liquidity bind, said it is able to make the payments because it completed a transaction with <ORGANIZATION>Greenery Rehabilitation Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in which <ORGANIZATION>Greenery</ORGANIZATION> purchased stock and warrants for $500,000 and loaned <ORGANIZATION>Healthcare</ORGANIZATION> $9 million.
The loan is backed by <ORGANIZATION>Healthcare</ORGANIZATION>'s 5.4% stake in <ORGANIZATION>HealthVest</ORGANIZATION> and interest in certain facilities. 
The oboist <PERSON>Heinz Holliger</PERSON> has taken a hard line about the problem: He commissions and splendidly interprets fearsome contemporary scores and does some conducting, so he doesn't have to play the same <PERSON>Mozart</PERSON> and <PERSON>Strauss</PERSON> concertos over and over again. 
Years ago, he collaborated with the new music gurus <PERSON>Peter Serkin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Fred Sherry</PERSON> in the very countercultural chamber group <ORGANIZATION>Tashi</ORGANIZATION>, which won audiences over to dreaded contemporary scores like <PERSON>Messiaen</PERSON>'s "Quartet for the End of Time." 
Then, as if to show that he could play fast as well, he offered the second movement from <PERSON>Saint-Saens</PERSON>'s Sonata for Clarinet, a whimsical, puckish tidbit that reflected the flip side of the <PERSON>Stoltzman</PERSON> personality. 
<PERSON>Mr. Stoltzman</PERSON> introduced his colleagues: <PERSON>Bill Douglas</PERSON>, pianist/bassoonist/composer and an old buddy from <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>, and jazz bassist <PERSON>Eddie Gomez</PERSON>.
An improvisational section was built around pieces by <PERSON>Mr. Douglas</PERSON>, beginning with "Golden Rain," a lilting, laid-back lead in to the uptempo "Sky," which gave <PERSON>Mr. Stoltzman</PERSON> the opportunity to wail in a high register and show off his fleet fingers.
<PERSON>Mr. Stoltzman</PERSON> tied the composer in by proclaiming him "the great improviser of the 18th century," and then built on the image by joining with <PERSON>Mr. Douglas</PERSON> in some <PERSON>Bach</PERSON> two-part inventions, cleverly arranged for clarinet and bassoon by <PERSON>Mr. Douglas</PERSON>.
Keeping the mood light, the two then chanted and chortled their way through some murderous polyrhythms, devised by <PERSON>Mr. Douglas</PERSON> as an alternative to <PERSON>Hindemith</PERSON>'s dry theory-teaching techniques, and then, with <PERSON>Mr. Gomez</PERSON>, soared and improvised on the composer's tight "Bebop Etudes." 
The end of the first half, however, brought what the standing-room-only crowd seemed to be waiting for: the pop singer <PERSON>Judy Collins</PERSON>, who appears on "Inner Voices." Glamorous and pure-voiced as ever, <PERSON>Ms. Collins</PERSON> sang <PERSON>Joni Mitchell</PERSON>'s "For Free" -- about an encounter with a street-corner clarinetist, to which <PERSON>Mr. Stoltzman</PERSON> contributed a clarinet obligatto -- and <PERSON>Mr. Douglas</PERSON>'s lush setting of a Gaelic blessing, "Deep Peace." "Deep Peace" also featured a slide show of lovely but predictable images of clouds, beaches, deserts, sunsets, etc.
<PERSON>Mr. Stoltzman</PERSON> must have worried that his audience might not be able to take it: He warned us in advance that "<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Counterpoint" lasts 11 1/2 minutes.
He also unfortunately illustrated this intricate, jazzy tapestry with <PERSON>Mr. Pearson</PERSON>'s images, this time of geometric or repeating objects, in a kitschy mirroring of the musical structure that was thoroughly distracting from <PERSON>Mr. Reich</PERSON>'s piece and <PERSON>Mr. Stoltzman</PERSON>'s elegant execution of it.
The rest of the concert was more straight jazz and mellow sounds written by <PERSON>Charlie Parker</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ornette Coleman</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bill Douglas</PERSON> and <PERSON>Eddie Gomez</PERSON>, with pictures for the <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON> pieces.
It was not an unpleasant evening, certainly, thanks to the high level of performance, the compositional talents of <PERSON>Mr. Douglas</PERSON>, and the obvious sincerity with which <PERSON>Mr. Stoltzman</PERSON> chooses his selections.
<PERSON>Ms. Waleson</PERSON> is a free-lance writer based in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Panhandle Eastern Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it applied, on behalf of two of its subsidiaries, to the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</ORGANIZATION> for permission to build a 352-mile, $273 million pipeline system from <LOCATION>Pittsburg County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Okla.</LOCATION>, to <LOCATION>Independence</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Miss</LOCATION>. 
The natural gas pipeline concern said the 500 million cubic feet a day capacity pipeline would be built by a proposed joint venture between two <ORGANIZATION>Panhandle Eastern units-Texas Eastern Transmission Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Trunkline Gas Co</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Texas Eastern Transmission</ORGANIZATION> will build and operate the system, which will connect the <LOCATION>Arkoma Basin</LOCATION> with several interstate pipelines. 
<PERSON>Robert Q. Marston</PERSON>, president emeritus, <ORGANIZATION>University of Florida</ORGANIZATION>, and a director of this maker of medical devices, was named chairman.
<PERSON>Dr. Marston</PERSON>, 66 years old, succeeds <PERSON>Alexander T. Daignault</PERSON>, 72, who didn't stand for re-election due to mandatory board retirement policy. 
The <LOCATION>Wilmington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, garment service company also boosted its quarterly dividend 20% to three cents a share adjusted for the split.
<ORGANIZATION>SFE Technologies</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>William P. Kuehn</PERSON> was elected chairman and chief executive officer of this troubled electronics parts maker. 
The 45-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Kuehn</PERSON>, who has a background in crisis management, succeeds <PERSON>Alan D. Rubendall</PERSON>, 45. 
<PERSON>Jerome J. Jahn</PERSON>, executive vice president and chief financial officer, said <PERSON>Mr. Rubendall</PERSON> was resigning by "mutual agreement" with the board. "He is going to pursue other interests," <PERSON>Mr. Jahn</PERSON> said. 
"The <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> has historically paid obeisance to the ideal of a level playing field," wrote <PERSON>Clyde S. McGregor</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Winnetka</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, in one of the 92 letters the agency has received since the changes were proposed Aug. 17. "Apparently the commission did not really believe in this ideal." 
The changes were proposed in an effort to streamline federal bureaucracy and boost compliance by the executives "who are really calling the shots," said <PERSON>Brian Lane</PERSON>, special counsel at the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>'s office of disclosure policy, which proposed the changes. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Committee on Federal Regulation of Securities</ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>American Bar Association</ORGANIZATION> argues, for example, in its lengthy letter to the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>, that the proposed changes "would substantially improve the {law} by conforming it more closely to contemporary business realities." 
The <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Lane</PERSON> vehemently disputed those estimates.
But <PERSON>Robert Gabele</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Invest/Net</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>North Miami</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, company that packages and sells the insider-trading data, said the proposal is worded so vaguely that key officials may fail to file the reports. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Lane</PERSON> said that while the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> regulates who files, the law tells them when to do so.
The <ORGANIZATION>Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust</ORGANIZATION> said it is considering several ways to ease a liquidity crunch that could include the sale of <ORGANIZATION>Manville Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to a third party. 
In a filing with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>, the majority holder of <ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION> acknowledged that the cash portion of its initial funding of $765 million will be depleted next year, and that alternative sources of funds will be necessary to meet its obligations.
The trust, which was created as part of <ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy-law reorganization to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases, ultimately expects to receive $2.5 billion from <ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION>, but its cash flow from investments has so far lagged behind its payments to victims. 
The trust is considering a sale of its <ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION> holdings, but <ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION> has the right of first refusal on any sales of its stock held by the trust. 
<ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION>, a forest and building products concern, has offered to pay the trust $500 million for a majority of <ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION>'s convertible preferred stock.
The filing also said the trust is considering a sale of <ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION> securities in the open market; an extraordinary dividend on the common stock; or a recapitalization of <ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION>. 
Unemployment has reached 27.6% in <LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION>, 25.7% in <LOCATION>Tadzhikistan</LOCATION>, 22.8% in <LOCATION>Uzbekistan</LOCATION>, 18.8% in <LOCATION>Turkmenia</LOCATION>, 18% in <LOCATION>Armenia</LOCATION> and 16.3% in <LOCATION>Kirgizia</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> newspaper said.
All are non-Russian republics along the southern border of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, and all but <LOCATION>Kirgizia</LOCATION> have reported rioting in the past six months. 
The newspaper said it is past time for the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> to create unemployment insurance and retraining programs like those of the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>. 
An 11-week dispute involving <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s 1,640 domestic pilots has slashed airline earnings and crippled much of the continent's tourist industry. "The only people who are flying are those who have to," said <PERSON>Frank Moore</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Tourist Industry Association</ORGANIZATION>.
He added: "How is a travel agent going to sell a holiday when he cannot guarantee a return flight?" Transport giant <ORGANIZATION>TNT</ORGANIZATION>, which owns half of one of the country's two major domestic carriers, said the cost of the dispute had been heavy, cutting <ORGANIZATION>TNT</ORGANIZATION>'s profits 70% to $12 million in the three months to Sept. 30. 
<PERSON>Mr. Nahas</PERSON>, who single-handedly provoked a one-day closure of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s stock markets in June when he failed to honor a debt of $31.1 million owed to his brokers, yesterday blamed his predicament on the president of the <LOCATION>Sao Paulo</LOCATION> stock exchange; a few days before <PERSON>Mr. Nahas</PERSON>'s failure, the exchange raised the required margin on stock-margin transactions. 
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s parliament ousted two <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> residents from a panel drafting a new constitution for the colony.
The two, <PERSON>Szeto Wah</PERSON> and <PERSON>Martin Lee</PERSON>, were deemed unfit because they had condemned <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s crackdown on its pro-democracy movement.
The committee is formulating <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s constitution for when it reverts to Chinese control in 1997, and Chinese lawmakers said the two can only return if they "abandon their antagonistic stand against the <ORGANIZATION>Chinese government</ORGANIZATION> and their attempt to nullify the Sino-British joint declaration on <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>." 
<LOCATION>Israeli</LOCATION> officials confirmed that Energy Minister <PERSON>Moshe Shahal</PERSON> and his Canadian counterpart, <PERSON>Jake Epp</PERSON>, discussed a possible Israeli purchase of a $1.1 billion Canadian nuclear reactor for producing electricity.
However, a <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Embassy</ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION>Tel Aviv</LOCATION> said that <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> was unlikely to sell the <ORGANIZATION>Candu</ORGANIZATION> heavy-water reactor to <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> since <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> hasn't signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
South Korean government officials said they don't expect that <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> can loan money to <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION>, but it can "offer experience." <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> is the second Communist nation to recognize the <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> government; <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> established diplomatic relations with <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> in February 1989. 
A song by American singer <PERSON>Tracy Chapman</PERSON> praising jailed black leader <PERSON>Nelson Mandela</PERSON> was banned from South African state radio and television.
The <ORGANIZATION>South African Broadcasting Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said the song "Freedom Now" was "undesirable for broadcasting." . . . <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>House of Commons</ORGANIZATION> passed a law that will force English soccer fans to carry identity cards to enter stadiums.
<ORGANIZATION>The Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION> said it is willing to let the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Tax Court</ORGANIZATION> decide how much oil man <PERSON>William Herbert Hunt</PERSON> will owe the government after his assets are liquidated. 
The surprise announcement came after the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> broke off negotiations with <PERSON>Mr. Hunt</PERSON> on a settlement of the one-time tycoon's personal bankruptcy case.
Although the action removes one obstacle in the way of an overall settlement to the case, it also means that <PERSON>Mr. Hunt</PERSON> could be stripped of virtually all of his assets if the <ORGANIZATION>Tax Court</ORGANIZATION> rules against him in a 1982 case heard earlier this year in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>
The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> has been seeking more than $300 million in back taxes from <PERSON>Mr. Hunt</PERSON>. 
Separately, a federal judge hearing <PERSON>Mr. Hunt</PERSON>'s bankruptcy case yesterday turned down a proposed $65.7 million settlement between <PERSON>Mr. Hunt</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Minpeco S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, another major creditor in the case.
Regarding <PERSON>Mr. Hunt</PERSON>'s taxes, he and the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> have apparently agreed on a basic formula for liquidating his estate in which the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> would get 70% of the proceeds from a liquidating trust and 30% would go to other creditors.
The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> had demanded $90 million but <PERSON>Mr. Hunt</PERSON> would agree to no more than $60 million. 
<PERSON>Grover Hartt III</PERSON>, a government lawyer, warned that <PERSON>Mr. Hunt</PERSON> stood to lose certain oil and gas properties, $200,000 in English pottery, a <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> condominium and other assets he might have kept if he had settled with the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>. "But they wanted to roll the dice and we're going to let them," <PERSON>Mr. Hartt</PERSON> said. 
<PERSON>Stephen McCartin</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Hunt</PERSON>'s attorney, said his client welcomed the gamble. 
The separate contracts were from <ORGANIZATION>Paragould Light & Water Commission</ORGANIZATION>, a utility in <LOCATION>Paragould</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>PSE Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a cogeneration-plant operator in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Milton B. Hollander</PERSON>, 60 years old, was named chief executive officer, succeeding <PERSON>Barrett B. Weekes</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr. Hollander</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Stamford</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Conn.-based High Technology Holding Co.</ORGANIZATION> acquired most of its 49.4% stake in <LOCATION>Newport</LOCATION> in August.
<PERSON>Mr. Hollander</PERSON> was named chairman last week, succeeding <PERSON>Mr. Weekes</PERSON>, who was among the ousted directors. 
The company has declined requests to discuss the changes, but <PERSON>Mr. Weekes</PERSON> has said that <PERSON>Mr. Hollander</PERSON> wanted to have his own team. 
<PERSON>Scott Wakeman</PERSON> was named president and chief operating officer of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> operations, titles that had been held by <PERSON>Mr. Weekes</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr. Wakeman</PERSON> was vice president of the instrument and controls division of closely held <ORGANIZATION>Omega Engineering Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, another company controlled by <PERSON>Mr. Hollander</PERSON>.
<PERSON>James R. Lees</PERSON>, 51, vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Newport</ORGANIZATION>'s European operations, was named executive vice president and chief operating officer of European operations, assuming some former duties of <PERSON>Mr. Weekes</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Arthur B. Crozier</PERSON>, 34, an attorney, was named secretary, succeeding <PERSON>John Virtue</PERSON>, who was another of the ousted directors. 
The result last spring was the arrest by West German authorities of five young West Germans, accused of stealing information from computers in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and selling it to the Soviet <ORGANIZATION>KGB</ORGANIZATION>.
One of them, 25-year-old <PERSON>Markus Hess</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Hannover</LOCATION>, allegedly used the international telecommunications network to break into more than 30 high-security computers in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, searching for secrets.
He probably didn't penetrate any top-secret files, but the <ORGANIZATION>KGB</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>East Berlin</LOCATION> was willing to pay two of his associates, <PERSON>Peter Carl</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dirk Brezinski</PERSON>, $15,000 for some of the material <PERSON>Hess</PERSON> collected.
<PERSON>Mr. Stoll</PERSON> was scanning the heavens at the <PERSON>Keck</PERSON> observatory of the <ORGANIZATION>Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> in 1986 when his grant ran low and he was asked to switch to helping run the lab's computers.
But after much tracking, it became evident to <PERSON>Mr. Stoll</PERSON>, through various clues, that the hacker was not on the <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> campus or even in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
After discovering that the hacker had taken over the dormant account of a legitimate user named <PERSON>Joe Sventek</PERSON>, he rigged up an alarm system, including a portable beeper, to alert him when <PERSON>Sventek</PERSON> came on the line.
The hacker was pawing over the <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> files but also using <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> and other easily accessible computers as stepping stones to the network of computers used by the military and national security agencies.
The <LOCATION>White Sands</LOCATION> missile range and <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> contractor <ORGANIZATION>Mitre Inc.</ORGANIZATION> were among the targets.
One learns a lot from this book, or seems to, about crippling federal bureaucracy. "Seems to" because it's possible that the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>National Security Agency</ORGANIZATION> were more interested than they let on to <PERSON>Mr. Stoll</PERSON>. 
One of its international specialists, <PERSON>Steve White</PERSON>, took a quick interest in <PERSON>Mr. Stoll</PERSON>'s hunt, ultimately tracing the hacker to <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>.
Eventually, <PERSON>Mr. Stoll</PERSON> was invited to both the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NSA</ORGANIZATION> to brief high-ranking officers on computer theft.
<ORGANIZATION>Fibreboard Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it completed the previously reported sale of approximately 27,500 acres of timberland near <LOCATION>Truckee</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, to closely held <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Pacific Industries Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Arcata</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, for $32.5 million.
<ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON>David Mulford</PERSON> defended the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>'s efforts this fall to drive down the value of the dollar, saying it helped minimize damage from the 190-point drop in the stock market Oct. 13. 
Testifying before a <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, <PERSON>Mr. Mulford</PERSON> said that if the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> hadn't intervened in foreign-exchange markets in September and early October to reduce the dollar's value, the plunge in the stock market might have provoked a steep fall in the currency that might have "unhinged financial markets." 
Differences between the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> on the usefulness of intervention to help restrain the dollar resurfaced at the hearing.
<ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> Vice Chairman <PERSON>Manuel Johnson</PERSON>, who had dissented from the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>'s policy, told lawmakers, "I became convinced about what looked to me like an attempt to push the dollar down against the fundamentals in the market." 
Rep. <PERSON>John LaFalce</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>) said <PERSON>Mr. Johnson</PERSON> refused to testify jointly with <PERSON>Mr. Mulford</PERSON> and instead asked to appear after the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> official had completed his testimony.
A <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> spokesman denied <PERSON>Mr. LaFalce</PERSON>'s statement. 
<PERSON>Mr. Mulford</PERSON> said reports of tension between the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> have been exaggerated, insisting that they involved "nuances." <PERSON>Mr. Johnson</PERSON> also said that "in the scheme of things, these things are minor." 
On other matters, <PERSON>Mr. Mulford</PERSON> said <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> is contributing to imbalances in the world economy because of its success as an exporter. "The solution is stronger domestic growth {in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>}," he said.
But because the growth of the German economy has been stronger than expected, <PERSON>Mr. Mulford</PERSON> said, it's difficult for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> to argue that <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> ought to adopt more stimulative monetary and fiscal policies. 
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s trade surplus is largely with other European countries rather than with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Mulford</PERSON> acknowledged.
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> in June vetoed a measure passed by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and said he wouldn't accept any minimum-wage rise that went beyond limits he set early in this year's debate on the issue. 
Under the agreement with the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> leaders, the minimum wage would rise from the current $3.35 an hour to $4.25 an hour by April 1991.
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> aides said that although they made a small compromise on the length of a training wage, the final minimum-wage increase will meet the standards set by <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>. 
In the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Edward Kennedy</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>), chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Labor Committee</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Pete Domenici</PERSON>, (R., <LOCATION>N.M.</LOCATION>) ranking minority member of the <ORGANIZATION>Budget Committee</ORGANIZATION>, have been working on a compromise, and their soundings showed that the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> appeared to be heading toward enough strength to override another <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> veto, a Democratic staff official said. 
Rep. <PERSON>Austin Murphy</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>), chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>House labor standards subcommittee</ORGANIZATION>, said they might have done better "if we'd held their feet to the fire." <PERSON>Mr. Kennedy</PERSON> suggested Democrats "yielded a great deal" on the size of the increase, but he cited concessions from the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> on the training wage, which he said make it "less harsh." 
Another fight is brewing between <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration over how to pay for the savings-and-loan bailout without adding to the federal budget deficit. 
In a hearing before the <ORGANIZATION>House Ways and Means Committee</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>General Accounting Office</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Congressional Budget Office</ORGANIZATION>, which both are arms of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, advised the new S&L bailout agency to abandon plans to raise temporary working capital through debt issued from an agency that wouldn't be counted on the federal budget. 
Instead, the <ORGANIZATION>GAO</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Congressional Budget Office</ORGANIZATION> said, the <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION> should consider using <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> debt, which is less expensive and subject to oversight by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
But higher interest rates paid on off-budget debt could add billions to the bailout costs, and wouldn't be subject to congressional scrutiny, <ORGANIZATION>Ways and Means</ORGANIZATION> members argued. "To allow this massive level of unfettered federal borrowing without prior congressional approval would be irresponsible," said Rep. <PERSON>Fortney Stark</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>), who has introduced a bill to limit the <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION>'s authority to issue debt. 
<PERSON>David Mullins</PERSON>, assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>, said that the working capital is necessary to reduce the final costs of the bailout, by allowing the agency to sell savings and loans without their bad assets, then hold the assets until they can be sold under favorable conditions. 
<ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it expects its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales to remain steady at about 1,200 cars in 1990.
The luxury auto maker last year sold 1,214 cars in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <PERSON>Howard Mosher</PERSON>, president and chief executive officer, said he anticipates growth for the luxury auto maker in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, and in Far Eastern markets. 
FOREIGN PRIME RATES: <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> 13.50%; <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> 9%; <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> 4.875%; <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> 8.50%; <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> 15%.
<ORGANIZATION>FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORP.</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Freddie Mac</ORGANIZATION>): Posted yields on 30-year mortgage commitments for delivery within 30 days. 9.78%, standard conventional fixed-rate mortgages; 7.875%, 2% rate capped one-year adjustable rate mortgages.
<ORGANIZATION>FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Fannie Mae</ORGANIZATION>): Posted yields on 30 year mortgage commitments for delivery within 30 days (priced at par) 9.75%, standard conventional fixed-rate mortgages; 8.75%, 6/2 rate capped one-year adjustable rate mortgages.
<PERSON>Hani Zayadi</PERSON> was appointed president and chief executive officer of this financially troubled department store chain, effective Nov. 15, succeeding <PERSON>Frank Robertson</PERSON>, who is retiring early.
<PERSON>Mr. Zayadi</PERSON> was previously president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION>Zellers Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a retail chain that is owned by Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION>Hudson's Bay Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s largest department store operator. 
Crouched at shortstop, <PERSON>Bert Campaneris</PERSON>, once <ORGANIZATION>Oakland</ORGANIZATION>'s master thief, effortlessly scoops up a groundball and flips it to second.
In the outfield, <PERSON>Paul Blair</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Orioles</ORGANIZATION>' eight-time Gold Glove winner, elegantly shags a fly.
On the mound, former <ORGANIZATION>Red Sox</ORGANIZATION> great <PERSON>Luis Tiant</PERSON>, the wily master of 1,001 moves, throws an off-speed strike. 
"Babies, kiddies," growls their manager -- a fellow named <PERSON>Earl Weaver</PERSON>, who, in a different time, handled four World Series teams and now handles the <ORGANIZATION>Gold Coast Suns</ORGANIZATION>. "Old-time kiddies," he says. 
"Someone always makes you quit," says legendary <ORGANIZATION>St. Louis Cardinals</ORGANIZATION> centerfielder <PERSON>Curt Flood</PERSON>, the league's commissioner. "You feel you want one more -- one more at-bat, one more hit, one more game." 
It's one more for the baseball-loving lawyers, accountants and real estate developers who ponied up about $1 million each for the chance to be an owner, to step into the shoes of a <PERSON>Gene Autry</PERSON> or have a beer with <PERSON>Rollie Fingers</PERSON>. 
"Nothing can be better than this," says <PERSON>Don Sider</PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION>West Palm Beach Tropics</ORGANIZATION>.
It's one more, too, for the fans who dream of a season that never ends. "I feel like a little kid," says a gleeful <PERSON>Alex de Castro</PERSON>, a car salesman, who has stopped by a workout of the <ORGANIZATION>Suns</ORGANIZATION> to slip six <PERSON>Campaneris</PERSON> cards to the <PERSON>Great Man Himself</PERSON> to be autographed.
The league is the brainchild of <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> real estate developer <PERSON>James Morley</PERSON> -- once a minor-leaguer himself -- who says he had the idea last January while lying on a beach in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
Real good," says 39-year-old <PERSON>Pete Broberg</PERSON>, working in the midday heat of the <ORGANIZATION>Tropics</ORGANIZATION> camp.
<PERSON>Mr. Broberg</PERSON>, who started with the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION>Washington Senators</ORGANIZATION>, says that when he left baseball in 1978, he "never looked back." For a long time, he ignored baseball altogether, even the sports pages. 
The nagging memory of one afternoon fourteen years ago drove <PERSON>Jim Gideon</PERSON>, a lean 36-year-old righthander to take a four-month leave from selling insurance in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> to try out for <PERSON>Mr. Weaver</PERSON>'s team. 
Back in 1975, late in the season, a then-21 <PERSON>Mr. Gideon</PERSON> made his only major league appearance, five and two-thirds innings for the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Rangers</ORGANIZATION> against the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago White Sox</ORGANIZATION>.
"There's a satisfaction in going against the rules," offers <PERSON>Will McEnaney</PERSON>, once a stopper with <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Big Red Machine</ORGANIZATION>.
These days he hustles to house-painting jobs in his <ORGANIZATION>Chevy</ORGANIZATION> pickup before and after training with the <ORGANIZATION>Tropics</ORGANIZATION>.
While sipping a beer after practice, he vividly recounts getting the <ORGANIZATION>Red Sox</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Carl Yastrzemski</PERSON> to pop out to end the 1975 World Series, and repeating the feat against the <ORGANIZATION>Yankees</ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON>Roy White</PERSON> in 1976. 
Some have been training for months; others only recently left active status. (No one has worked out the players' average age, but most appear to be in their late 30s.) And there's pride. "I'm not going to look stupid," vows former <ORGANIZATION>Pittsburgh Pirate</ORGANIZATION> second baseman <PERSON>Rennie Stennett</PERSON>, sweat dotting his brow as he prepares for some practice swings. 
At the weatherbeaten <LOCATION>Pompano Beach</LOCATION> municipal stadium, <PERSON>Mr. Blair</PERSON>, the 45-year-old former <ORGANIZATION>Oriole</ORGANIZATION>, knows his power isn't what it used to be.
And don't expect many complete games by pitchers -- perhaps three out of 288, laughs <PERSON>Mr. Fingers</PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION>Oakland</ORGANIZATION> reliever.
White-haired <PERSON>Pedro Ramos</PERSON>, at 54 the league's oldest player and a pitcher-coach with the <ORGANIZATION>Suns</ORGANIZATION>, has lost even more speed.
<PERSON>Thomas A. Donovan</PERSON>, 37 years old, formerly vice president, <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> operations, at this hazardous-waste-site remediation concern, was named executive vice president and chief operating officer, both newly created posts, and a director, filling a vacancy.
<ORGANIZATION>Canonie</ORGANIZATION> said it anticipates naming <PERSON>Mr. Donovan</PERSON> to succeed <PERSON>Richard F. Brissette</PERSON>, 55, as president and chief executive officer, effective March 1.
<PERSON>Mr. Brissette</PERSON> will remain a <ORGANIZATION>Canonie</ORGANIZATION> board member and will be a consultant to the company. 
<ORGANIZATION>Time Warner Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION> may be today's public enemies, but the two entertainment giants could end up becoming partners in a number of ventures as part of a settlement of their acrimonious legal dispute over <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> producers <PERSON>Peter Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jon Peters</PERSON>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Warner Bros.</ORGANIZATION> studio and <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> signaled they are close to a settlement yesterday, asking a <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Superior Court</ORGANIZATION> to postpone a hearing scheduled for tomorrow on <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>'s request for a preliminary injunction blocking <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> from taking the top posts at <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> is acquiring <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Guber-Peters Entertainment Co.</ORGANIZATION> in two separate transactions valued at more than $5 billion.
<ORGANIZATION>Warner Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which is being acquired by <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner</ORGANIZATION>, has filed a $1 billion breach-of-contract suit against <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> and the two producers.
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> has a five-year exclusive contract with <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> that requires them to make movies exclusively at the <ORGANIZATION>Warner Bros.</ORGANIZATION> studio. 
The two sides in the legal battle have hurled accusations of duplicity at each other for weeks, and both <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> have accused each other of trying to sabotage each other's prospects for success in the entertainment business.
Both <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on the terms of the settlement discussions.
Instead, <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> is likely to agree to let <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> participate in certain of its businesses, such as the record club of <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>CBS Records</ORGANIZATION> unit.
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> has surpassed <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> as the largest record company, but it doesn't have a powerful world-wide record club like <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>. 
In addition, <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> is expected to agree to swap <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s 35% stake in the sprawling <LOCATION>Burbank</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, studio that <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> share, in exchange for the old <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION> studio lot that <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> acquired with the purchase of <ORGANIZATION>Lorimar Telepictures Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
One, for example, came from <ORGANIZATION>CBS Records</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Walter Yetnikoff</PERSON>, who will head a committee that will oversee <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>'s entertainment division, including both records and movies.
In his affidavit, <PERSON>Mr. Yetnikoff</PERSON> accused <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Steven J. Ross</PERSON> of having an "antiSony, anti-Japanese bias" and said that <PERSON>Mr. Ross</PERSON> had tried to talk him out of letting <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> buy <ORGANIZATION>CBS Records</ORGANIZATION> two years ago for that reason. 
<PERSON>Mr. Ross</PERSON>, who will be chairman and co-chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner</ORGANIZATION> after the merger is complete, denied that in his own affidavit, and called <PERSON>Mr. Yetnikoff</PERSON>'s remarks "vicious" and his claims "reckless, irresponsible and baseless," saying <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> under his leadership has started a number of businesses in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Ross</PERSON> also said he enjoys "warm professional and personal relationships" with Japanese executives including <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Akio Morita</PERSON>, "who has visited my home here." 
But despite the acrimony between <PERSON>Mr. Ross</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Yetnikoff</PERSON>, officials of the <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION> side of <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner</ORGANIZATION> have reportedly been increasingly interested in a settlement that might yield attractive business opportunities.
Time executives such as the company's president, <PERSON>N.J. Nicholas</PERSON>, who will eventually be co-chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner</ORGANIZATION> alongside <PERSON>Mr. Ross</PERSON>, have no personal relationships or ego at stake in the fight over the Guber-Peters duo, and were never directly drawn into the fray. 
Talks between the two sides could unravel, of course, as they have more than once since <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> announced its plans to hire <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON>.
Any settlement is also expected to exclude <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> from any of the projects they were working on at <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>.
But that doesn't mean <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> might not eventually get their hands on some of their projects; studios develop hundreds of movies but produce only 10 to 20 each year.
<PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> also almost certainly wouldn't be able to participate in future sequels to "Batman," the blockbuster hit they produced for <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>.
But in acquiring <ORGANIZATION>Guber-Peters Entertainment</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> will actually get a piece of the profits from "Batman," since the publicly held concern gets certain revenue from the movies <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> produce.
<ORGANIZATION>Metromedia</ORGANIZATION> said its unit is the fifth-largest provider of long-distance communications service in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, with projected 1989 revenue of more than $550 million. 
<ORGANIZATION>Metromedia</ORGANIZATION>, headed by <PERSON>John W. Kluge</PERSON>, has interests in telecommunications, robotic painting, computer software, restaurants and entertainment. 
Earlier this month, a group led by three of the company's directors, <PERSON>Burt Sugarman</PERSON>, <PERSON>James M. Trotter III</PERSON> and <PERSON>Willam E. Trotter II</PERSON>, indicated it had a 45.2% stake in the <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>, fast-food company and that it planned to seek a majority of seats on <ORGANIZATION>Rally's</ORGANIZATION> nine-member board. 
Avery paid $750 million, including various legal and financing fees, to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Uniroyal Chemical</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Middlebury</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, in 1986 -- a move that burdened Avery with debt. 
<ORGANIZATION>Uniroyal</ORGANIZATION> has 2,600 employees and facilities in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>. 
In a related development, <ORGANIZATION>Avery</ORGANIZATION> said it completed a recapitalization in which its controlling shareholders and top officers, <PERSON>Nelson Peltz</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peter W. May</PERSON>, surrendered warrants and preferred stock in exchange for a larger stake in <ORGANIZATION>Avery</ORGANIZATION>'s common shares.
<PERSON>Peltz</PERSON> and May sold their stock in <ORGANIZATION>Triangle Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a packaging company they controlled, to <ORGANIZATION>Pechiney Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
The executives had profited handsomely by building <ORGANIZATION>American National Can Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Triangle</ORGANIZATION>'s chief asset. 
In January 1989, the two men acquired the non-packaging assets of <ORGANIZATION>Triangle</ORGANIZATION>, including a controlling stake in Avery and, by extension, <ORGANIZATION>Uniroyal Chemical</ORGANIZATION>.
In the August proxy material, <PERSON>Avery</PERSON> said that unless it sold <ORGANIZATION>Uniroyal</ORGANIZATION>, its ability to service debt would be hurt and <ORGANIZATION>Avery</ORGANIZATION>'s shareholder value would "continue to erode." Until Avery makes an acquisition, Messrs.
But <PERSON>Asher B. Edelman</PERSON>, who controls about 16% of the <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, computer-servicing company, insisted that the announcement didn't have anything to do with the ongoing battle for control of <ORGANIZATION>Datapoint Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
Any sale of <ORGANIZATION>Intelogic</ORGANIZATION> could have an impact on the battle between <PERSON>Mr. Edelman</PERSON> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> attorney <PERSON>Martin Ackerman</PERSON> for control of <ORGANIZATION>Datapoint</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Intelogic</ORGANIZATION> holds 27.5% of <ORGANIZATION>Datapoint</ORGANIZATION>'s common shares outstanding. 
<PERSON>Mr. Edelman</PERSON> said the decision "has nothing to do with <PERSON>Marty Ackerman</PERSON>." <PERSON>Mr. Ackerman</PERSON> contended that it was a direct response to his efforts to gain control of <ORGANIZATION>Datapoint</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Intelogic</ORGANIZATION> was spun off from <LOCATION>Datapoint</LOCATION> four years ago, shortly after <PERSON>Mr. Edelman</PERSON> took control of <ORGANIZATION>Datapoint</ORGANIZATION>. 
A permanent smoking ban on virtually all domestic airline routes won approval from the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, which separately sent to President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> a nearly $67 billion fiscal 1990 bill including the first construction funds for the space station. 
The sole exceptions are an estimated 30 flights of six hours or more beginning or ending in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>.
The separate $67 billion bill sent to the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> had budget difficulties, too, but was saved ultimately by its importance to a broad spectrum of interests in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and the administration itself.
But the promise of at least $15 million in new savings helped to forge a partnership between <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Jack Kemp</PERSON> and lawmakers wanting to protect their projects elsewhere. 
And while imposing a statutory cap of $1.6 billion on future spending, the bill would give <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> $30 million for the start-up of the CRAF-Cassini mission, a successor to the <LOCATION>Voyager</LOCATION> space probe. 
Senior members of the <ORGANIZATION>House Budget Committee</ORGANIZATION> are reduced in frustration to raising doomed parliamentary obstacles to individual bills, yet admit that much of the disorder now stems from the fiscal legerdemain associated with their own summit agreement with the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> this past spring. "It's hard to get the administration's attention on anything," said Rep. <PERSON>Bill Frenzel</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Minn.</LOCATION>), "because the whole agreement was built on gimmickry." 
<ORGANIZATION>Senate Appropriations Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Robert Byrd</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>W.Va.</LOCATION>) strongly resisted deeper cuts sought by the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Sen. Pete Domenici</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>N.M.</LOCATION>), the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Budget Committee</ORGANIZATION>, used his influence to preserve more than $132,000 in subsidies for air service to <ORGANIZATION>Sante Fe</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>N.M.</LOCATION>, and more than $2.1 million would go for service to eight communities in the western <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> district of GOP Rep. <PERSON>Virginia Smith</PERSON> on the <ORGANIZATION>House Appropriations Committee</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>GP Express</ORGANIZATION>, an independent airline serving much of <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, estimates that nearly 40% of its revenues come from the subsidies that, in some cases, exceed the cost of a ticket.
For example, a passenger can fly from <LOCATION>Chardon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neb.</LOCATION>, to <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> for as little as $89 to $109, according to prices quoted by the company.
But given the few number of users, the cost to the federal government per passenger is estimated at $193, according to <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> appropriations committees. 
The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> action yesterday came as the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> remained mired in difficulties over a $17.25 billion measure covering the budgets for the State, <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Justice</ORGANIZATION> departments in fiscal 1990.
The compromise bill passed the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> last week but has now provoked jurisdictional fights with the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Foreign Relations Committee</ORGANIZATION>, which jealously protects its prerogatives over operations at the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> appropriators sought to establish a Nov. 30 deadline after which their bill would become the last word on how funds are distributed.
But on a 53-45 roll call this provision was stripped from the bill last night after Foreign Relations Chairman <PERSON>Claiborne Pell</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>R.I.</LOCATION>) complained that it was an intrusion on exclusive powers vested in his panel for more than three decades. 
The results surpassed analysts' forecasts, which averaged around #200 million, and <ORGANIZATION>Marks & Spencer</ORGANIZATION> responded in trading on <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> with an eight pence rise to 188 pence. 
Sales in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION> were inflated by acquisitions, rising 62% to #278 million.
<ORGANIZATION>American Enterprise Institute</ORGANIZATION> scholar <PERSON>Norman Ornstein</PERSON> in the Oct. 21 TV Guide on "What TV News Doesn't Report About <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> -- and Should": 
By concentrating all their resources on the pay raise, <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> and Tower, the networks actually overlooked some major stories that showed the flaws and shortcomings of the institution. . . . An imaginative producer could easily have created a fast-moving and interesting piece about how <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> really works -- and why voters in, say, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> got a federally funded university project and building while voters in <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> did not.
<ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's unsolicited $3.19 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION>Great Northern Nekoosa Corp.</ORGANIZATION> was hailed by Wall Street despite a cool reception by the target company. 
<PERSON>William R. Laidig</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, chief executive officer and president, characterized the $58-a-share bid as "uninvited" and said <ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION>'s board would consider the offer "in due course." 
<PERSON>T. Marshall Hahn Jr.</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, said in an interview that all terms of the offer are negotiable.
He added that he had spoken with <PERSON>Mr. Laidig</PERSON>, whom he referred to as a friend, by telephone Monday evening. "I'm hopeful that we'll have further discussions," <PERSON>Mr. Hahn</PERSON> said. 
On Wall Street, takeover stock traders bid <ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION>'s stock well above the <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> bid, assuming that <ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION>'s will either be sold to a rival bidder or to <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> at a higher price -- as much as $75 a share, according to some estimates. 
Yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION> common closed in composite <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> trading at $62.875, up $20.125, on volume of almost 6.3 million shares.
<ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> closed down $2.50, at $50.875 in <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> trading. 
For the paper industry specifically, most analysts said the deal will spur a wave of paper-company takeovers, possibly involving such companies as <ORGANIZATION>Union Camp Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Federal Paperboard Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mead Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> offer has definitely changed the landscape," said <PERSON>Gary Palmero</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Oppenheimer & Co</ORGANIZATION>. Added <PERSON>Mark Rogers</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ORGANIZATION>: "It's much easier to be second." 
A <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION> would create the largest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> forest-products company.
Based on 1988 sales, <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> ranked third at $9.51 billion, behind <ORGANIZATION>Weyerhaeuser Co.</ORGANIZATION> at $10 billion and <ORGANIZATION>International Paper Co.</ORGANIZATION> at $9.53 billion.
Moreover, any unexpected strengthening of the dollar would hurt <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> because two of <ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION>'s major product lines -- containerboard, which is used to make shipping boxes, and market pulp -- are exported in large quantities. 
"Nobody knows how deep the cycle is going to be," said <PERSON>Rod Young</PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Resource Information Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Bedford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, economic-forecasting firm. "Depending on how far down you go, it may be difficult to pay off that debt." 
It also could be a drag on <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> earnings because the roughly $1.5 billion in goodwill -- the amount by which the bid exceeds <ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION>'s book value of $1.5 billion -- will have to be subtracted from earnings over a period of decades. 
<ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Hahn</PERSON> said that a combined operation would allow savings in many ways.
And <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> could save money in selling pulp, because the company uses its own sales organization while <ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION> employs higher-cost agents. 
<PERSON>Mr. Hahn</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> has accounted in its strategy for a "significant downturn" in the pulp and paper industry, an event that he said would temporarily dilute earnings.
<ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, which has suspended its stock-repurchase program, would finance the acquisition with all bank debt, provided by banks led by <ORGANIZATION>BankAmerica Corp</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> owns 349,900 <ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION> shares and would need federal antitrust clearance to buy more than $15 million worth.
The company's chairman, <PERSON>Mr. Laidig</PERSON>, and a group of advisers met at the offices of <ORGANIZATION>Wachtel Lipton Rosen & Katz</ORGANIZATION>, a law firm specializing in takeover defense.
<ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION> also is being advised by <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s advisers are <LOCATION>Wasserstein</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Perella & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which stands to receive a $15 million fee if the takeover succeeds, and the law firm of <ORGANIZATION>Shearman & Sterling</ORGANIZATION>. 
In addition to the usual array of defenses, including a so-called poison pill and a staggered board, <ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION> has another takeover defense: a <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> state law barring hostile bidders from merging acquired businesses for five years.
<ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION> is incorporated in <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> has filed a lawsuit in federal court in <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> challenging the poison pill and the <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> merger law. 
<ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION>'s poison pill allows shareholders to vote to rescind it, but <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> isn't likely to pursue such a course immediately because that would take 90 to 120 days, and wouldn't affect the provisions of the <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> law. 
Among companies mentioned by analysts as possible counterbidders for <ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION> are <ORGANIZATION>International Paper</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Weyerhaeuser</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Pacific Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>MacMillan Bloedel Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> "I'm sure everybody else is putting pencil to paper," said <PERSON>Kathryn McAuley</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>First Manhattan Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>International Paper</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Weyerhaeuser</PERSON> declined to comment.
Canadian Pacific couldn't be reached for comment, and <ORGANIZATION>MacMillan Bloedel</ORGANIZATION> said it hasn't any plans to make a bid for <ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION>. 
Among paper company stocks that rallied on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> because of the offer were <ORGANIZATION>Union Camp</ORGANIZATION>, up $2.75 to $37.75, <ORGANIZATION>Federal Paperboard</ORGANIZATION>, up $1.75 to $27.875, <ORGANIZATION>Mead</ORGANIZATION>, up $2.375 to $38.75, and <ORGANIZATION>Temple Inland Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, up $3.75 to $62.25.
Moreover, some analysts said they expect a foreign paper company with deeper pockets than <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> to end up acquiring <ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION>, signaling to the rest of the industry that hostile bids are unproductive. 
"This is a one-time event," said <PERSON>Lawrence Ross</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, referring to the <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> bid. 
But many analysts believe that, given the attractiveness of paper companies' cash flows, as well as the frantic consolidation of the paper industry in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, there will be at least a few more big hostile bids for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies within the next several months.
"The <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> bid may open the door to a new era of consolidation" in the paper industry, said <PERSON>Mark Devario</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
"I don't think anyone is now immune from takeover," said <PERSON>Robert Schneider</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Duff & Phelps Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Rodgers</PERSON> said he doesn't see the industry's capacity-expansion program hindering takeover activity.
Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Devario</PERSON> said that, to stay competitive, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> paper industry needs to catch up with the <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> industry.
<ORGANIZATION>Shop Television Network Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>Penney</ORGANIZATION> agreed to continue its exclusive arrangement with <ORGANIZATION>Shop Television</ORGANIZATION>, which does the production, marketing and cable distribution for the <ORGANIZATION>J.C. Penney Television Shopping Channel</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Michael Rosen</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Shop Television</ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION>Penney</LOCATION> decided to extend its involvement with the service for at least five years.
Earlier this year, <PERSON>Penney</PERSON> abandoned another home shopping venture, <ORGANIZATION>Telaction Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, after investing $106 million in it.
<PERSON>Richard Rifenburgh</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of the <LOCATION>Longmont</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, disk-drive maker, also said the company continued losing money in the third quarter and expects to sustain further losses through the end of the year. 
<PERSON>Mr. Rifenburgh</PERSON> also noted that 150 million shares of <ORGANIZATION>MiniScribe</ORGANIZATION> common stock were traded during the past three years, "so there's a tremendous amount of exposure." 
Analysts and consultants had mixed reactions to yesterday's announcements, praising <PERSON>Mr. Rifenburgh</PERSON>'s efforts but questioning whether the company can survive in a highly competitive marketplace. "It's a wait-and-see attitude," said <PERSON>Dave Vellante</PERSON>, vice president of storage research for <ORGANIZATION>International Data Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Others pointed out that at least four other disk-drive makers will have competitive one-inch drives early next year and that the industry already operates on very thin margins. 
<ORGANIZATION>MiniScribe</ORGANIZATION> filed a status report with the <ORGANIZATION>NASD</ORGANIZATION> on Monday, detailing its efforts to comply with listing requirements and requesting an extension of the exception, but hasn't received a response.
Meanwhile, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON>Jerry Rafferty</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> is reviewing the report prepared by <ORGANIZATION>MiniScribe</ORGANIZATION>'s outside directors, to determine if criminal charges should be brought before a grand jury. 
The internal investigation also criticized <ORGANIZATION>MiniScribe</ORGANIZATION>'s auditors, <ORGANIZATION>Coopers & Lybrand</ORGANIZATION>, for allegedly ignoring numerous red flags. 
The company also retained attorney <PERSON>Martin P. Levin</PERSON>, a director of the company and former head of the <ORGANIZATION>Times-Mirror Publishing Group</ORGANIZATION>, as an adviser. 
"Wage increases and overall compensation increases are beginning to curl upward a little bit," said <PERSON>Audrey Freedman</PERSON>, a labor economist at the <ORGANIZATION>Conference Board</ORGANIZATION>, a business research organization. 
<ORGANIZATION>QVC Network Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it completed its acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>CVN Cos.</ORGANIZATION> for about $423 million. 
<ORGANIZATION>QVC</ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay $19 and one-eighth <ORGANIZATION>QVC</ORGANIZATION> share for each of <ORGANIZATION>CVN</ORGANIZATION>'s 20 million fully diluted shares. 
Among them, Home Shopping, <ORGANIZATION>QVC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>CVN</ORGANIZATION> already control most of that young and fast-growing market, which last year had sales of about $1.4 billion. 
<ORGANIZATION>First Federal Bancorp Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>James Clarkson</PERSON>, its chairman, president and chief executive officer, retired effective yesterday.
<ORGANIZATION>First Federal</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Mr. Clarkson</PERSON>, 65 years old, is "fully cooperating in the continuing review." 
"None of the activities being reviewed has any adverse effect on the financial condition of the bank or its depositors," <ORGANIZATION>First Federal Savings Bank & Trust</ORGANIZATION>'s president, <PERSON>Leo D. Ottoni</PERSON>, said.
<ORGANIZATION>First Federal Savings</ORGANIZATION> is a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>First Federal Bancorp</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>First Federal</ORGANIZATION> named <PERSON>Mr. Ottoni</PERSON> president and chief executive to succeed <PERSON>Mr. Clarkson</PERSON> and elected him as a director.
As the crippled jet prepared for an emergency landing, <LOCATION>Sylvia Tsao</LOCATION> wrapped her 23-month-old son, <PERSON>Evan</PERSON>, in blankets and, following cabin-crew orders, placed him on the floor.
Crashing into a cornfield, <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>' Flight 232 flipped over, and she lost her grip on her son. "I saw for an instant my son's body floating and flying" toward the back of the plane, <PERSON>Ms. Tsao</PERSON> recalled.
During the <LOCATION>Sioux City</LOCATION> crash, <PERSON>Lori Michaelson</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> lost her grip on her baby as the plane lurched and tipped over.
When <PERSON>Vanessa Merton</PERSON>, an associate dean at <ORGANIZATION>Pace University School of Law</ORGANIZATION>, decided to take her young son to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> last spring, she called four carriers to ask about their policies on car seats. "The people acted like I was transporting heroin," she says.
After the <ORGANIZATION>Sioux City</ORGANIZATION> crash, <PERSON>Lori Michaelson</PERSON> bought a car seat for her daughter for the flight home to <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION>.
"People are told one thing on the phone, another at check in, another at the gate, and another on the plane," says <PERSON>Stephanie Tombrello</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Area Child Passenger Safety Association</ORGANIZATION>, which petitioned the <ORGANIZATION>FAA</ORGANIZATION> in June for mandatory use of child-safety seats.
<PERSON>Anthony Broderick</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>FAA</ORGANIZATION>'s acting executive director for regulatory standards and compliance, contends that the current rule is the best approach because it allows parents to make their own decision on whether to use a safety seat.
<PERSON>Walter Coleman</PERSON>, vice president of operations for the <ORGANIZATION>Air Transport Association</ORGANIZATION>, the trade group for the major airlines, describes the call for safety seats as "legitimate" and says the group is studying the issue. 
Proponents of safety seats are turning up the heat on the <ORGANIZATION>FAA</ORGANIZATION>. Yesterday, Rep. <PERSON>James Lightfoot</PERSON>, an <LOCATION>Iowa Republican</LOCATION>, sent <ORGANIZATION>FAA</ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON>James Busey</PERSON> a letter signed by 56 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> members urging the agency to require infant safety seats.
If the <ORGANIZATION>FAA</ORGANIZATION> refuses, Rep. <PERSON>Lightfoot</PERSON> says, he will push legislation to require the change. 
Federal and state thrift examiners said they saw evidence of criminal wrongdoing in the collapse of <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln Savings & Loan Association</ORGANIZATION>, and a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> regulator described an attempted "whitewash" by deputies of chief federal regulator <PERSON>Danny Wall</PERSON>. 
In a riveting day of hearings before the <ORGANIZATION>House Banking Committee</ORGANIZATION>, the examiners described finding shredded documents, a mysterious Panamanian subsidiary, millions of dollars funneled into a Swiss bank, and a complacent attitude by <PERSON>Mr. Wall</PERSON>'s deputies, one of whom was portrayed as acting more like a public-relations man for the thrift than a federal regulator. 
A <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> official also said he sent the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Bureau of Investigation</ORGANIZATION> a packet of documents relating to a previously reported $400,000 contribution from <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION>'s parent solicited by <PERSON>Sen. Alan Cranston</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>). 
Federal examiner <PERSON>Alex Barabolak</PERSON> said <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s operations amounted to "pyramiding debt to provide a luxurious life style for its owners." Another federal examiner, <PERSON>John Meek</PERSON>, said <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s principal owner, <PERSON>Charles Keating Jr.</PERSON>, and his family drew off at least $34 million from the thrift in salaries, bonuses and proceeds from securities sales in the 3 1/2 years before federal authorities seized it earlier this year.
"I think there's overwhelming evidence to indicate probable criminal activity," said <PERSON>Mr. Meek</PERSON>, who participated last year in an examination of the <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, thrift.
<PERSON>Richard Newsom</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> state official who last year examined <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln</ORGANIZATION>'s parent, <ORGANIZATION>American Continental Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said he also saw evidence that crimes had been committed. "It sure smells like it," he said.
<PERSON>Leonard Bickwit</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> attorney for <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln</ORGANIZATION>'s parent corporation, said in an interview, "We deny any criminal behavior by the association or its officers." 
<PERSON>Mr. Wall</PERSON>'s deputies complained that they hadn't been given an opportunity to respond to the criticism brought out during the <ORGANIZATION>Banking Committee</ORGANIZATION>'s hearings, which <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Henry Gonzalez</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>) has used as a forum to flay <PERSON>Mr. Wall</PERSON>'s handling of the affair and to demand that he step aside from his job. 
"A couple of things <PERSON>Mr. Newsom</PERSON> said were at least misleading," said <PERSON>Kevin O'Connell</PERSON>, one of the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> regulators responsible for the handling of <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION>.
"Our response to the whitewash would simply be, look what happened," another <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> official, <PERSON>Alvin Smuzynski</PERSON>, said in an interview.
Rep. <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> has complained that regulators waited far too long, however, ignoring a recommendation from regional officials to place <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> into receivership two years before it failed. "He took the reckless course of ignoring the evidence," Rep. <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> said. 
State thrift examiner <PERSON>Eugene Stelzer</PERSON> said he found the chief federal examiner <PERSON>Steve Scott</PERSON> to be totally uninterested in one allegedly fraudulent series of transactions. "Frankly, it was like he worked for the <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln</ORGANIZATION> public-relations department," <PERSON>Mr. Stelzer</PERSON> testified.
And <PERSON>David Riley</PERSON>, a federal examiner who worked under <PERSON>Mr. Scott</PERSON>, said he found his chief oddly upbeat about <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr. Meek</PERSON> said that a day or two before <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s parent entered bankruptcy proceedings, he and other examiners saw "a truck with a sign on it that said it was from the `Document Destruction Center. ' We observed at least two large plastic bags of shredded paper loaded into this truck." 
<PERSON>Mr. Meek</PERSON> said his suspicions were aroused by several foreign investments by <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION>, including $22 million paid to <ORGANIZATION>Credit Suisse</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>, an $18 million interest in <LOCATION>Saudi European Bank</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, a $17.5 million investment in a <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION> trading company, and a recently discovered holding in a Panama-based company, <ORGANIZATION>Southbrook Holdings</ORGANIZATION>.
I would like to respond to <PERSON>Jude Wanniski</PERSON>'s Oct. 19 editorial-page article, "<PERSON>Bradley</PERSON>'s Team Gave the Market Its Drubbing," as a nonpartisan portfolio manager who is hardly amused by this overzealous emphasis on the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>'s maneuvering on capital gains as the prime reason for the market's slide on Oct. 13.
<PERSON>Mr. Wanniski</PERSON> can "cheerfully inform" <PERSON>Mr. Bradley</PERSON> and the rest of us of his notions as to the party's end, but his energy and intellect would be better used in focusing on measures that will ensure our long-term success as leaders and capitalists. 
The great <ORGANIZATION>Growth Bull Market</ORGANIZATION> began in June 1978 just when the late Rep. <PERSON>William Steiger</PERSON>'s proposal to cut the capital-gains tax to 25% from almost 50% began to gather majority support in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Wanniski</PERSON>'s opportuning of the recent stock drubbing to castigate <PERSON>Sen. Bill Bradley</PERSON> for his opposition to a capital-gains tax cut contains some clever but faulty reasoning.
<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> stocks posted a second-consecutive loss Monday, while trading in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, was mixed. 
In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Financial Times</ORGANIZATION> 100-share index finished 30.1 points higher at 2112.2.
It will be Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON>John Major</PERSON>'s first appearance before the opposition <ORGANIZATION>Labor Party</ORGANIZATION>.
Dealers said fresh buying was drawn into <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> after a senior executive of <ORGANIZATION>Daimler-Benz</ORGANIZATION>, the auto maker, told a British television interviewer during the weekend that the West German company held talks with the luxury auto maker over possible joint ventures.
Although <PERSON>Daimler</PERSON> has said it isn't interested in mounting a bid for <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, dealers said its name further underlined the growing interest in the British concern. 
In early trading in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION>Nikkei</ORGANIZATION> index rose 35.28 points to 35452.72. 
<PERSON>Takamori Matsuda</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Dresdner-ABD Securities</ORGANIZATION>, said fading expectation for lower interest rates made investors step back from real-estate shares, which advanced last week.
The <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the <ORGANIZATION>First Section</ORGANIZATION>, which fell 15.82 points Friday, was down 5.16 points, or 0.19%, at 2676.60.
Another factor weighing on the <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> market involves fears about the impending wage talks between the <ORGANIZATION>IG Metall</ORGANIZATION> metal-workers union and industry representatives, which could result in a wave of strikes next spring, traders said. 
Elsewhere, stock prices were lower in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>, and mixed in <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION>. 
Stocks closed higher in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION>, but were lower in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>. 
Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION>.
In one of many rosy scenarios, <ORGANIZATION>Bear Stearns</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Gary Schneider</PERSON> wrote in March that its real estate alone had a value of $4.5 billion.
With real estate experts <ORGANIZATION>Olympia & York</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Samuel Zell</PERSON>'s Itel owning close to 40% of <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>'s stock, management was under pressure -- in a favored phrase of Wall Street -- to quickly "maximize values." 
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> has disclosed that it is negotiating to sell a 20% interest in its real estate unit to the <ORGANIZATION>California Public Employees Retirement System</ORGANIZATION> for roughly $400 million.
<PERSON>Robert D. Krebs</PERSON>, <PERSON>Santa Fe</PERSON>'s chairman, argues that since its businesses are valued in different ways, "the sum of the parts may be greater than the whole." 
<PERSON>Mr. Schneider</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Bear Stearns</ORGANIZATION> says he is recalculating the worth of the company's assets and, in the meantime, is sticking to his "buy" recommendation on the belief that he will find "values" of 30 a share.
<ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Graeme Anne Lidgerwood</PERSON> values <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> at 24, down from her earlier estimate of 29.
Chairman <PERSON>Krebs</PERSON> says the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> pension fund is getting a bargain price that wouldn't have been offered to others.
And, as <PERSON>Mr. Zell</PERSON> says, with <ORGANIZATION>Itel</ORGANIZATION> and O&Y on the unit's board, the real estate will be run by "a very unusual group" to say the least. 
But as <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> analyst <ORGANIZATION>Linda Dunn</ORGANIZATION> notes, its properties will be developed over 15 to 20 years.
However, the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> limited the revenue that banks could earn from these new underwriting activities to no more than 10% of the revenue earned from other securities activities long open to banks, such as dealing in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Treasurys</ORGANIZATION>. 
But, by allowing <ORGANIZATION>BT Securities Inc.</ORGANIZATION> to handle private placements, the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> boosted the volume of new types of underwriting that the unit can do. 
<LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> will repeal the unpopular turnover tax on securities transactions as of Jan. 1, 1991, Economics Minister <PERSON>Helmut Haussmann</PERSON> said. 
The securities-turnover tax has been long criticized by the West German financial community because it tends to drive securities trading and other banking activities out of <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> into rival financial centers, especially <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, where trading transactions isn't taxed. 
After 20 years of pushing labor proposals to overhaul the nation's health-care system, <PERSON>Bert Seidman</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>AFL-CIO</ORGANIZATION> is finding interest from an unlikely quarter: big business. 
Failure to check rising medical costs ultimately could "lead some of us who today are free-market advocates to re-examine our thinking and positions with respect to government-sponsored national health insurance," <PERSON>Arthur Puccini</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> vice president, warned earlier this year. 
Both the <ORGANIZATION>AFL-CIO</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Manufacturers</ORGANIZATION> are calling for measures to control rising costs, improve quality and provide care to the 31 million Americans who currently lack health insurance. 
But there are signs that labor-management cooperation could change the politics of health-care legislation and the economics of medicine. "I can't remember a time when virtually everyone can agree on what the problem is," says <PERSON>Mr. Seidman</PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION>AFL-CIO</ORGANIZATION>'s department dealing with health matters. 
Because the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration isn't taking the initiative on health issues, business executives are dealing with congressional Democrats who champion health-care revision. "Business across the country is spending more time addressing this issue," says <PERSON>Sen. Edward Kennedy</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>). "It's a bottom-line issue." Business complained earlier this year when <PERSON>Sen. Kennedy</PERSON> introduced a bill that would require employers to provide a minimum level of health insurance to workers but doesn't contain cost-control measures.
<ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION> estimates that health costs add $700 to the price of each of its cars, about $300 to $500 more per car than foreign competitors pay for health. "The cost of health care is eroding standards of living and sapping industrial strength," complains <PERSON>Walter Maher</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> health-and-benefits specialist. 
Health benefits are contentious issues in the strikes against <ORGANIZATION>Pittston Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Nynex Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
In their new contract this year, <ORGANIZATION>American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Communications Workers of America</ORGANIZATION> agreed to look for "prompt and lasting national solutions" to rising health-care costs. 
<PERSON>Carl Schramm</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Health Insurance Association of America</ORGANIZATION>, scoffs at "capitalists who want to socialize the entire financing system" for health. "They hope they can buy some government cost discipline," but this is a false hope, <PERSON>Mr. Schramm</PERSON> says.
So far neither the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration nor <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> is prepared to lead the way toward revamping health care.
A bipartisan commission established by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and headed by <PERSON>Sen. John Rockefeller</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>W.Va.</LOCATION>) is scheduled to present new plans for dealing with the uninsured and long-term care for the elderly by next March 1.
A quadrennial commission appointed by <ORGANIZATION>Health and Human Services</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Louis Sullivan</PERSON> is taking a broad look at the economics of Medicare for the elderly, Medicaid for the poor and the health system in general.
"No magic bullet will be discovered next year, an election year," says Rep. <PERSON>Fortney Stark</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>) But 1991 could be a window for action.
The pressure for change will rise with costs. "I think employers are really going to be the ones to push for major change," says <PERSON>Sharon Canner</PERSON>, a health expert at <ORGANIZATION>NAM</ORGANIZATION>. 
Any major attempt to revamp the health-care system is likely to trigger opposition from politically powerful interest groups, particularly the <ORGANIZATION>American Medical Association</ORGANIZATION>, and perhaps from the public as well, if <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> takes steps that patients fear will limit the availability of care. 
<ORGANIZATION>HHS</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> estimates that as much as 25% of the medical procedures performed each year may be inappropriate or unnecessary. 
The portfolio unit of the French bank group <ORGANIZATION>Credit Lyonnais</ORGANIZATION> told stock market regulators that it bought 43,000 shares of Cie. de <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION>, apparently to help fend off an unwelcome takeover bid for the company. 
Earlier yesterday, the <ORGANIZATION>Societe de Bourses Francaises</ORGANIZATION> was told that a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Framatome S.A.</ORGANIZATION> also bought <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> shares, this purchase covering more than 160,000 shares. 
It never ceases to amaze me how the business world continues to trivialize the world's environmental problems ("Is Science, or Private Gain, Driving Ozone Policy?" by <PERSON>George Melloan</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Business World</ORGANIZATION>, Oct. 24).
If you are doubtful, consider for a moment that the <ORGANIZATION>Pomton Lakes Reservoirs</ORGANIZATION> in northern <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, which supply the tristate area with drinking water, are riddled with toxic PCBs.

As an employee of a major refrigerator and freezer manufacturer, I have been heavily involved in dealing with the political manifestations of the <LOCATION>Rowland-Molina</LOCATION> theory (named after the researchers who found in 1974 that chlorofluorocarbons contributed to the depletion of ozone in the earth's atmosphere) and the <ORGANIZATION>Montreal Protocol</ORGANIZATION>.
In my research, I have found a paper by <PERSON>Joseph Scotto</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION> and several colleagues reporting an 11-year decrease in UV-B radiation at eight <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> measurement sites. 
My questions on this subject at a recent meeting at the <ORGANIZATION>World Resources Institute</ORGANIZATION> with representatives of the <ORGANIZATION>National Resource Development Commission</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION>, Friends of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, etc. were greeted with derision and some mumbled comments about that report being discredited.
Subsequently, I have learned that a private group, of which <ORGANIZATION>Du Pont</ORGANIZATION> is a part, is funding a modest program to continue data gathering at the Scotto report stations as well as to develop more sophisticated <ORGANIZATION>UVB</ORGANIZATION> measuring instruments.
The discovery of the ozone "hole" over <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> and the results of ground-based and high-altitude aircraft experiments conducted over the past several years serve as evidence that ozone depletion is related to <ORGANIZATION>CFC</ORGANIZATION> concentrations. 
In the September issue of Scientific American, <PERSON>Thomas E.

Little Inc.</ORGANIZATION> to support his statement.
<PERSON>Graedel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Crutzen</PERSON>, who are both pioneers in the study of atmospheric chemistry, <PERSON>Mr. Teagan</PERSON> has no special expertise in the area.

Director <PERSON>Steve Kloves</PERSON> took a big gamble on <PERSON>Michelle Pfeiffer</PERSON>'s voice.
And doing studio work has been a wonderful way to make a living for a long, long time," said <PERSON>Ms. Stevens</PERSON>, who for five years in a row received the Most Valuable Player award as a female studio vocalist from the <ORGANIZATION>National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences</ORGANIZATION>, the organization that hands out the Grammys. 
<PERSON>Ms. Stevens</PERSON>'s involvement with "Baker Boys" was the result of a long affiliation with the movie's composer, <PERSON>Dave Grusin</PERSON>. "I had written lyrics with him and had sung for him in various films and contracted voices for him," she said. "He knew my work and he called.
He said, `I don't know if this is going to be a compliment or an insult but . . .' Then he explained that <PERSON>Michelle</PERSON> was going to do this film and the role she was playing was that of a singer and they wanted very much for her to do her own singing if that was possible." At that point nobody, including <PERSON>Ms. Pfeiffer</PERSON> herself, was certain it would be possible. 
If <PERSON>Ms. Pfeiffer</PERSON> wasn't sure she was up to putting over numbers like "The Look of Love," "Ten Cents a Dance" and "My Funny Valentine," <PERSON>Ms. Stevens</PERSON> wasn't sure she was up to showing the way. "I had not done any coaching before," she said. "I have produced vocal performances in the studio for professional singers.
I think <PERSON>Dave</PERSON> thought that in my career I had done what the <PERSON>Susie Diamond</PERSON> character had done and that <PERSON>Michelle</PERSON>, consciously or unconsciously, would pick up some things." 
One of the first lessons took place at the <ORGANIZATION>Cinegrill</ORGANIZATION>, a lounge in the <LOCATION>Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel</LOCATION> where <PERSON>Ms. Stevens</PERSON> brought <PERSON>Ms. Pfeiffer</PERSON> to hear a nightclub singer and soak up some atmosphere. "Her instincts were wonderfully astute," remembered <PERSON>Ms. Stevens</PERSON>, who is in her 40s. "<PERSON>Michelle</PERSON> sensed an undercurrent of anger in the singer's performance.
As for <PERSON>Ms. Pfeiffer</PERSON>'s vocal development: For five or six weeks, <PERSON>Ms. Stevens</PERSON> made daily two-hour visits to the actress's <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION> home armed with sheet music, and on occasion albums by <PERSON>June Christy</PERSON>, <PERSON>Blossom Dearie</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ella Fitzgerald</PERSON>, artists <PERSON>Ms. Pfeiffer</PERSON> hadn't paid much mind to in the past. "I suggested <LOCATION>Michelle</LOCATION> listen to <LOCATION>Ella</LOCATION>," said <PERSON>Ms. Stevens</PERSON>. "Nobody sings better, not that I wanted her to sound like <LOCATION>Ella</LOCATION> but there's a quality artists of that period had that we felt the character <PERSON>Susie</PERSON> might have listened to." 
From the way she sang in those early sessions, it seemed clear that <PERSON>Michelle</PERSON> had been listening not to <LOCATION>Ella</LOCATION> but to <PERSON>Bob Dylan</PERSON>. "There was a pronunciation and approach that seemed Dylan-influenced," recalled <PERSON>Ms. Stevens</PERSON>.
Vowels were swallowed, word endings were given short or no shrift. "When we worked it almost became a joke with us that I was constantly reminding her to say the consonants as well as the vowels." To explain exactly what she meant, <PERSON>Ms. Stevens</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Grusin</PERSON> went into a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> studio and recorded a vocal/piano demo of the songs being considered for inclusion in the movie so that <PERSON>Ms. Pfeiffer</PERSON> could learn the numbers, correct enunciation and all.
<PERSON>Mr. Grusin</PERSON> also made a demo tape with just piano to provide accompaniment when <PERSON>Ms. Pfeiffer</PERSON> practiced. 
What <PERSON>Ms. Pfeiffer</PERSON> had going for her besides determination -- <PERSON>Ms. Stevens</PERSON> recalled that the actress was up one night until 3 a.m. practicing "My Funny Valentine" -- was an airy alto, a nice breathy quality and intelligence. "When we first started working it was a matter of finding a language we both understood," <PERSON>Ms. Stevens</PERSON> said. "I couldn't talk with her as I would with someone who had a lot of vocal training." 
And please, <PERSON>Michelle</PERSON>, when you sing the line in "<PERSON>Makin</PERSON>' Whoopee," about another sunny, funny honeymoon, don't say "funn-ih," the way <PERSON>Dylan</PERSON> would.
"It was a process of discovery," said <PERSON>Ms. Stevens</PERSON>, who admitted she sometimes felt a bit like <PERSON>Henry Higgins</PERSON>. "What I tried to do was take the sparks of the positive stuff and fan them.
There was another layer to the coaching: Helping <PERSON>Ms. Pfeiffer</PERSON> sing a song the way <ORGANIZATION>Susie Diamond</ORGANIZATION> would sing it.
Not brilliantly, because, after all, this was a performer who was collecting paychecks from lounges at Hiltons and Holiday Inns, but creditably and with the air of someone for whom "Ten Cents a Dance" was more than a bit autobiographical. "It was an exercise of blending <PERSON>Michelle</PERSON>'s singing with <PERSON>Susie</PERSON>'s singing," explained <PERSON>Ms. Stevens</PERSON>. "If `Dangerous Liaisons' had been a musical she would have had to give a different vocal performance because she was a different character in that movie." 
That isn't really her." "I can swear that every single note in that movie was hers," averred <PERSON>Ms. Stevens</PERSON>, who had begun kidding her protege that she was going to get a `Tonight Show' booking. "Seeing <PERSON>Michelle</PERSON> up there," she added, "was like watching myself or my daughter.

The city's <ORGANIZATION>Department of Consumer Affairs</ORGANIZATION> charged <ORGANIZATION>Newmark & Lewis Inc.</ORGANIZATION> with failing to deliver on its promise of lowering prices. 
In a civil suit commenced in state <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the agency alleged that the consumer-electronics and appliance discount-retailing chain engaged in deceptive advertising by claiming to have "lowered every price on every item" as part of an advertising campaign that began June 1. 
<PERSON>Richard D. Lewis</PERSON>, president of the 47-store chain, defended the company's pricing campaign, saying it didn't use "the misleading expression `reduced from original prices. '" <PERSON>Mr. Lewis</PERSON> said the company marked price tags and advertised at its "lowest possible prices" for all its merchandise to reduce public confusion. 
<PERSON>Mr. Lewis</PERSON> said the company gave the <ORGANIZATION>Consumer Affairs</ORGANIZATION> department "volumes of documents" to substantiate its statements, and made "every effort to comply" with all the agency's policies. 
The <LOCATION>Des Plaines</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, chemical coatings concern, which has about 2,000 employees world-wide, said it plans to sell its domestic rigid container packaging and flexible adhesives businesses, and its <LOCATION>Chicago Heights</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, resin plant. 
<ORGANIZATION>Paramount Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it sold two <ORGANIZATION>Simon & Schuster</ORGANIZATION> information services units to <ORGANIZATION>Macmillan Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Maxwell Communication Corp</ORGANIZATION>.

They got a taste of it yesterday morning in full-page ads in major newspapers, including this paper, in which <ORGANIZATION>Neuberger & Berman</ORGANIZATION>, a big money <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> manager, demanded federal regulators "immediately" boost margins on stock-index futures to 50%. 
"If you decrease the liquidity in the futures market, you increase the discrepancies between stocks and futures," said <PERSON>Christopher Pedersen</PERSON>, director of trading at <ORGANIZATION>Twenty-First Securities Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
"You would diminish the impact of stock-index arbitrage enormously if you change the margin requirements for futures," said <PERSON>Richard Cantor</PERSON>, chief investment officer for <ORGANIZATION>Neuberger & Berman</ORGANIZATION>, which manages $17.5 billion in client funds. 
<PERSON>Mr. Cantor</PERSON> said that it was difficult to quantify the impact of stock index arbitrage on the performance of <ORGANIZATION>Neuberger & Berman</ORGANIZATION> -- whose tax-exempt accounts are lagging broad market averages so far this year -- or of other institutional investors.
"If futures margins are raised substantially, some other country will allow lower margins, and that's where the business will go," said <PERSON>Barry Lind</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Lind-Waldock & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a futures broker.

Traders expect the bonds to yield about 0.60 to 0.65 percentage point above the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year bond, which ended Tuesday with a yield of about 7.90%. 
In October 1979, just days before the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> raised interest rates, <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> offered $1 billion in debt securities.
"I think the $500 million is a little bit of a fire drill," said <PERSON>Jim Ednee</PERSON>, head of the industrial bond department at <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "I think as the pricing time arrives, the bonds will come a little richer and in a larger amount." 
A spokesman for underwriters <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION>Beatrice</ORGANIZATION> cut its high-yield offering to $251 million from a planned $350 million after it became clear the company would have to give investors higher yields.

<ORGANIZATION>StatesWest Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, said it withdrew its offer to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Mesa Airlines</ORGANIZATION> because the <LOCATION>Farmington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.M.</LOCATION>, carrier didn't respond to its offer by the close of business yesterday, a deadline <ORGANIZATION>StatesWest</ORGANIZATION> had set for a response. 
However, <ORGANIZATION>StatesWest</ORGANIZATION> isn't abandoning its pursuit of the much-larger <ORGANIZATION>Mesa</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>StatesWest</ORGANIZATION>, which has a 7.25% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Mesa</ORGANIZATION>, said it may purchase more <ORGANIZATION>Mesa</ORGANIZATION> stock or make a tender offer directly to <ORGANIZATION>Mesa</ORGANIZATION> shareholders. 
<ORGANIZATION>StatesWest</ORGANIZATION> had proposed acquiring <ORGANIZATION>Mesa</ORGANIZATION> for $7 a share and one share of a new series of <ORGANIZATION>StatesWest</ORGANIZATION> 6% convertible preferred stock it values at $3 a share.
Earlier, <PERSON>Mesa</PERSON> had rejected a general proposal from <ORGANIZATION>StatesWest</ORGANIZATION> to combine the two carriers in some way. 
<ORGANIZATION>StatesWest</ORGANIZATION> serves 10 cities in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>.
Mesa flies to 42 cities in <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.

Still, a lot of investors clearly have revived their interest in gold and utility shares. "The primary overriding thing is that people are frightened," says <PERSON>Martin Sass</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> money manager. "The aftershocks of Oct. 13 (when the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 190 points) are still reverberating." 
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s unsettled political scene also worries some investors. "The gyrations in the British government" add political uncertainty on top of high inflation and a ragged stock market, says <PERSON>John Hoffman</PERSON>, assistant director of research at <ORGANIZATION>Smith Barney</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Harris Upham & Co.</ORGANIZATION> "One of the three major markets in the world is getting chewed up pretty bad." 
"If the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> does not come to the rescue and produce lower short-term interest rates over the next 30 days, the market's going to flounder," says <PERSON>Larry Wachtel</PERSON>, a market analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Wachtel</PERSON> points to <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>PepsiCo Inc.</ORGANIZATION> as examples: They're selling for 18 to 22 times estimated 1990 per-share earnings. 
<PERSON>Robert Stovall</PERSON>, a veteran <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> money manager and president of <ORGANIZATION>Stovall/ Twenty-First Securities</ORGANIZATION>, has money in both gold and utility issues. "I think we could very well have {an economic} slowdown, beginning very soon if not already," he says. 
He favors <ORGANIZATION>FPL Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Florida Progress Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>TECO Energy Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Energy Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Dominion Resources Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
You go into them because they move counter to the general market." He adds that gold stocks had been down so long they were "ready for a bounce." His favorites are <ORGANIZATION>American Barrick Resources Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Echo Bay Mines Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Coeur d'Alene Mines Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Abby Cohen</PERSON>, an investment strategist for <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert</ORGANIZATION>, also thinks it makes sense to have some money in both utilities and gold. "My outlook is for a decline of about 10% in corporate profits" in 1990, she says.
Among utilities, <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> currently favors <ORGANIZATION>Entergy Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>General Public Utilities Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
Among gold stocks, <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> likes <ORGANIZATION>Battle Mountain Gold Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Newmont Gold Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Freeport-McMoRan Gold Co</ORGANIZATION>.

<ORGANIZATION>Orkem S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, a French state-controlled chemical manufacturer, is making a friendly bid of 470 pence ($7.43) a share for the 59.2% of <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> specialty chemical group <ORGANIZATION>Coates Brothers PLC</ORGANIZATION> which it doesn't already own, the two sides said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Orkem</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Coates</PERSON> said last Wednesday that the two were considering a merger, through <ORGANIZATION>Orkem</ORGANIZATION>'s British subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION>Orkem Coatings U.K. Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 
<LOCATION>Orkem</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s third-largest chemical group, said it would fund the acquisition through internal resources.
The takeover would be followed by a restructuring of <LOCATION>Orkem</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> unit, including the addition of related <ORGANIZATION>Orkem</ORGANIZATION> businesses and possibly further acquisitions.
<ORGANIZATION>Orkem</ORGANIZATION> said it eventually would seek to make a public share offering in its <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> business. 
Published everywhere to universal acclaim, doted on like a movie star in the Hispanic world from <ORGANIZATION>Barcelona</ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION>Ushuaia</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Vargas Llosa</PERSON> could live comfortably on his royalties and console his political conscience with the thought that <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> is a hopeless mess not of his making and that he already did his best to reform it with his magnificently cinematic novel about the years of military dictatorship of his youth, "Conversation in the Cathedral." 
But, after some hesitation, he is back on the stump and also still writing important novels about <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>. "The Storyteller" (<ORGANIZATION>Farrar</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Straus & Giroux</ORGANIZATION>, 246 pages, $17.95), splendidly translated by <PERSON>Helen Lane</PERSON>, first appeared in <LOCATION>Spanish</LOCATION> in 1987 before the <LOCATION>Peruvian</LOCATION> economy had reached its present state of virtual collapse.
Even still, the very first sentence of this fable that weaves together <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>'s most advanced and most primitive cultural strands speaks of "my unfortunate country." The narrator may be talking about the depredations of the Shining Path Maoists among the Indians of the Andes, or he may be referring to the plunging inti, <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>'s rubber currency, or the corrupting effect of the cocaine trade.
But he is swiftly drawn into a tangle of memories about a less newsworthy and more exotic part of <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>: its corner of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> jungle. 
He is in <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION> to shake himself free of <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> and get some writing done, just as <PERSON>Mr. Vargas Llosa</PERSON> has gone to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and now goes frequently to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> for the same purpose.
But this narrator happens upon some photographs in a gallery, pictures taken in <LOCATION>Peruvian Amazonia</LOCATION> of the untamed and nomadic <PERSON>Machiguenga</PERSON> tribe.
And they remind him of his own experiences with that unhappy scattered culture and of his friend at <LOCATION>Lima</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>University of San Marcos</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Saul Zuratas</PERSON>.
Saul was a high-strung student of ethnography, a Jew marked doubly as an outsider because of a huge wine-dark birthmark on his face, for which people called him <LOCATION>Mascarita</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mask Face</LOCATION>.
Saul knew about the <LOCATION>Machiguengas</LOCATION> from his studies, and through him the narrator became interested in this most recalcitrant and un-Westernizable of all the indigenous peoples who had come under the <LOCATION>Spanish</LOCATION> yoke.
It is as though <PERSON>Mr. Vargas Llosa</PERSON> had recorded a storytelling session at a <LOCATION>Machiguenga</LOCATION> campfire.
But the joke turns serious when a reportage takes him to <LOCATION>Amazonia</LOCATION> and he encounters the missionaries who know more than anyone else about the <LOCATION>Machiguengas</LOCATION>.
The region's population, currently estimated at some 500 million people, is growing by 3.2% a year -- "faster than any major region has ever experienced over a sustained period," the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> noted in a recent review of the region between the great desert and <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Lufthansa</ORGANIZATION> has agreed to buy a 10% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Austrian Airlines</ORGANIZATION> when the Austrian government continues next spring to sell parts of the carrier to the public, an <ORGANIZATION>Austrian Airlines</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said.
Elsewhere, <ORGANIZATION>Singapore Airlines Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, following its recently announced tie-up with <ORGANIZATION>Delta Air Lines Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, is now "contemplating an alliance" with one of several <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> carriers, Chairman <PERSON>J.Y. Pillay</PERSON> said. 
King Fahd of <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> dismissed as untrue allegations that his country's relations with <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> were marred by the Saudis' execution last month of 16 <PERSON>Kuwaiti Shiites</PERSON>; the Shiites had been convicted for bombings at <LOCATION>Mecca</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> is ending six weeks of seizing property from Palestinians who refuse to pay income and value-added taxes in the occupied <LOCATION>West Bank</LOCATION> town of <LOCATION>Beit Sahour</LOCATION>, despite having failed to break the revolt, security sources said.
The army gave no explanation for calling off the seizures, less than a month after <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON>Yitzhak Rabin</PERSON> vowed to break the tax rebels. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Asian Development Bank</ORGANIZATION> denied media speculation that it's about to resume lending to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>ADB</ORGANIZATION> staff is continuing to "prepare loan proposals for <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>" to present to the bank's board, said <ORGANIZATION>R.D. Pacheco</ORGANIZATION>, the bank's chief information officer.
Other <ORGANIZATION>ADB</ORGANIZATION> officials said the board wasn't ready to consider resuming loans to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> because leading <ORGANIZATION>ADB</ORGANIZATION> members, including the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, remain opposed to a return to normal business with <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>. 
As <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> formally announced it's joining an international ban on trading ivory, hundreds of angry ivory traders and carvers marched in downtown <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> to protest the ban.
Some of the marchers presented a petition to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> consulate demanding that <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, which earlier banned the import of ivory, help the endangered industry.
Environmental groups urged <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to stop importing timber from <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Sarawak</LOCATION> state, where they say loggers are destroying rain forests and trampling on the rights of natives. 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> imports about 50% of the logs exported from the state, which is on the island of <LOCATION>Borneo</LOCATION>.
The call came as the council of the <ORGANIZATION>International Tropical Timber Organization</ORGANIZATION> opened a nine-day session in the Japanese city of <LOCATION>Yokohama</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Dr. Mikhail Kavanagh</PERSON>, an official of the World Wide Fund for Nature, said that "anything that the Japanese can do to influence the trade is going to come straight back in to influence how the forests are managed." He urged <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to reduce "wasteful use of tropical timbers," such as disposable chopsticks. 
Pravda said that <PERSON>Nikolai Vasilenko</PERSON>, a Soviet farmer, dug up a gold bar valued at $235,000, but consumer-goods shortages left him little to spend it on during a trip to <LOCATION>Vladivostok</LOCATION>.
He wanted to buy, but couldn't find, a shaving brush, a sewing machine and a colander . . . <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is facing a musical talent shortage because top artists are leaving for foreign countries, the <ORGANIZATION>China Youth News</ORGANIZATION> said.
The utility holding company said <PERSON>Hunter</PERSON> will receive 390,000 shares of a new series of <ORGANIZATION>Cilcorp</ORGANIZATION> convertible preferred stock with a face value of $39 million for the businesses.
Twenty years later, two <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> academics, <PERSON>Stanley Cohen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Herbert Boyer</PERSON>, made "recombinant" DNA, transplanting a toad's gene into bacteria, which then reproduced toad genes. 
When <PERSON>Boyer</PERSON> met <PERSON>Robert Swanson</PERSON>, an M.I.T.-trained chemist-turned-entrepreneur in 1976, they saw dollar signs.
The next to be cloned, human insulin, had market potential and <ORGANIZATION>Genentech</ORGANIZATION> licensed it to <ORGANIZATION>Eli Lilly</ORGANIZATION>, which produced 80% of the insulin used by 1.5 million <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> diabetics. 
Their laboratory credentials established, <PERSON>Boyer</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Swanson</ORGANIZATION> headed for Wall Street in 1980.
Boyer and <PERSON>Cohen</PERSON>, for instance, both still university researchers, had to be talked into applying for a patent on their gene-splicing technique -- and then the <ORGANIZATION>Patent Office</ORGANIZATION> refused to grant it.
That judgment, in turn, was reversed by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>, leaving <PERSON>Cohen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Boyer</PERSON> holding the first patents for making recombinant DNA (now assigned to their schools). 
But even before it begins, the campaign is drawing fire from anti-smoking advocates, who criticize <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris</ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to bolster its beleaguered image by wrapping itself in the document that is a cornerstone of <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> democracy. 
<ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris</ORGANIZATION>, which became the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>'s largest food company last year with its $12.9 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Kraft Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, seems determined to evolve beyond its roots in <LOCATION>Marlboro</LOCATION> country.
The company's research suggests that its name recognition among most consumers remains unusually low, although its array of brands -- including <ORGANIZATION>Maxwell House</ORGANIZATION> coffee, Jell-O, <PERSON>Cheez Whiz</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> beer -- blanket supermarket shelves. 
The company is expected to spend about $30 million a year on its two-year corporate campaign, created by <ORGANIZATION>WPP Group's Ogilvy & Mather</ORGANIZATION> unit in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris</ORGANIZATION> hopes that by taking its <PERSON>Bill</PERSON> of Rights theme to the airwaves, in addition to publications, it will reach the broadest possible audience.
"Most people -- whether in <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Tucson</PERSON> or <LOCATION>Topeka</LOCATION> -- haven't got a clue who we are," says <PERSON>Guy L. Smith</PERSON>, <PERSON>Philip Morris</PERSON>'s vice president of corporate affairs. "If they think well of the company through our support of the Bill of Rights, it follows they'll think well of our products." <PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION>Bill of Rights</ORGANIZATION> commercial, which trumpets the themes of liberty and freedom of expression, isn't designed to have any special appeal for smokers.
But some anti-smoking activists disagree, expressing anger at what they see as the company's attempt to purchase innocence by association. "I'm outraged because this company is portraying itself at the heart of <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> culture and political freedom and in fact it's a killer," says <PERSON>Michael Pertschuk</PERSON>, former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Trade Commission</ORGANIZATION> and a tobacco-industry critic. "It should be treated like the <LOCATION>Medellin</LOCATION> {drug} mafia, not the Founding Fathers." 
<PERSON>Mr. Pertschuk</PERSON> adds that the new commercial dovetails perfectly with major aspects of <PERSON>Philip Morris</PERSON>'s political strategy.
Many marketers say <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris</ORGANIZATION>'s approach will be effective, but they agree that the ads' implied smoking message is unmistakable. "This is clever, subliminal advertising that really says, `Smokers have rights, too, '" says <PERSON>Al Ries</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Trout & Ries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Greenwich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, marketing strategy firm. "This is designed to get the wagons in a circle and defend the smoking franchise." 
<PERSON>Richard Winger</PERSON>, a partner at <ORGANIZATION>Boston Consulting Group</ORGANIZATION>, adds: "It's very popular to drape yourself in the flag these days.
<ORGANIZATION>RJR Nabisco Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>American Brands Inc.</ORGANIZATION> say they have no plans to follow <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris</ORGANIZATION>'s lead. (Indeed, <ORGANIZATION>RJR Nabisco</ORGANIZATION> is currently under fire for having sent 80-second videotapes touting its Now brand to consumers who smoke <ORGANIZATION>American Brands</ORGANIZATION>' Carltons.) 
Despite the criticism, <PERSON>Philip Morris</PERSON>'s corporate campaign runs little risk of getting yanked off the tube. "They aren't showing <PERSON>James Madison</PERSON> taking a puff or lighting up," says <PERSON>Laurence Tribe</PERSON>, a professor of constitutional law at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard University</ORGANIZATION>. "All they are trying to do is borrow some of the legitimacy of the Bill of Rights itself." 
The <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> oil and gas concern said that $10 million of the facility would be used to consolidate the company's $8.1 million of existing bank debt, to repurchase 4 million of its 4.9 million shares outstanding of Series D convertible preferred stock, and to purchase a 10% net-profits interest in certain oil and gas properties from one of its existing lenders, <ORGANIZATION>National Canada Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Ted Eubank</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Coda</ORGANIZATION>'s president, said the loan carries an interest rate of prime plus one percentage point, with 85% of the company's net oil and gas revenue each month dedicated to repayment.
<ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it downgraded about $970 million of senior debt of <ORGANIZATION>Arkla Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in response to the company's increased financial leverage, related primarily to restructuring plans that include taking a $189 million charge. 
<LOCATION>Arkla</LOCATION> is based in <LOCATION>Shreveport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>La</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>Arkla</LOCATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION>Entex</ORGANIZATION> in 1988. 
<ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION>'s said the rating action takes into account <LOCATION>Arkla</LOCATION>'s plan for an initial public offering of as much as 18% of the common stock of its oil and gas exploration and development subsidiary, proceeds of which will be used to repay debt. 
"From the beginning, it took a man with extraordinary qualities to succeed in Mexico," says <PERSON>Kimihide Takimura</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Mitsui group</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Kensetsu Engineering Inc.</ORGANIZATION> unit. 
Still, 20 Japanese companies, including giants such as <ORGANIZATION>Sanyo Industries Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Matsushita Electronics Components Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION> have set up shop in the state of <LOCATION>Northern Baja California</LOCATION>.
Keeping the Japanese happy will be one of the most important tasks facing conservative leader <PERSON>Ernesto Ruffo</PERSON> when he takes office Nov. 1, as the first opposition governor in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s modern history. 
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, with its desperate need for investment, and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, with its huge budget surplus, would seem like a perfect match.
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> ranks as only the fourth largest foreign investor in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, with 5% of the total investments.
<PERSON>Mr. Salinas</PERSON>'s unpopular <ORGANIZATION>Institutional Revolutionary Party</ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION>PRI</ORGANIZATION>, faces congressional elections in 1991.
For the <ORGANIZATION>PRI</ORGANIZATION> to stand a chance, <PERSON>Mr. Salinas</PERSON> has to press on with an economic program that so far has succeeded in lowering inflation and providing moderate economic growth.
The problem is that Japanese businesses make decisions with a view well beyond the coming months that weigh so heavily on <PERSON>Mr. Salinas</PERSON>. "The Japanese will come to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, but not immediately," says <PERSON>Kazushige Suzuki</PERSON>, director-general of the Japanese External Trade Organization in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Ryukichi Imai</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, agrees that <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> may be too eager.  "There seems to be a presumption in some sectors of (<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s) government that there is a lot of Japanese money waiting behind the gate, and that by slightly opening the gate, that money will enter <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.  I don't think that is the case."
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> is sending a number of missions to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> looking for a major breakthrough investment in telecommunications, petrochemicals or tourism.
But Japanese investors say that their reluctance to invest stems not only from concerns about <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s economic outlook, but also reservations about <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s recently revamped investment law.
"Those devices don't give sufficient certainty to our bosses in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>," says <PERSON>Yasuo Nakamura</PERSON>, representative of the <ORGANIZATION>Industrial Bank of Japan</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Nakamura</PERSON> cites the case of a customer who wants to build a giant tourism complex in <LOCATION>Baja</LOCATION> and has been trying for eight years to get around Mexican restrictions on foreign ownership of beachfront property.
"We must do more to help the Japanese here in <LOCATION>Baja</LOCATION> if we want them to invest elsewhere," says <PERSON>Mr. Ruffo</PERSON>, the governor-elect of the <ORGANIZATION>National Action Party</ORGANIZATION> and himself a succesful businessman.
But <PERSON>Mr. Ruffo</PERSON> frets that an even bigger problem could be protectionism from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, where some politicians oppose what they consider Japanese efforts to use maquiladoras to crack the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market through the back door. 
<PERSON>Barbara Hackman Franklin</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Franklin Associates</ORGANIZATION>, was elected a director of this building products maker.
<PERSON>Ms. Franklin</PERSON>, 49 years old, fills the position vacated by <PERSON>Naomi G. Albanese</PERSON>, who retired earlier this year at age 72. 
Both <PERSON>Clarcor</PERSON> and <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> are based in <LOCATION>Rockford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill</LOCATION>. 
In late May, <ORGANIZATION>Stena Holding AG</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Tiphook PLC</ORGANIZATION>, launched a $50-a-share, or $777 million, tender offer for the <LOCATION>Hamilton</LOCATION>, Bermuda-based <ORGANIZATION>Sea Containers</ORGANIZATION>.
News of the restructuring plan sent <ORGANIZATION>Sea Containers</ORGANIZATION>' shares up $1 to $62 in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading. 
<PERSON>Walter Kirchberger</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said that offering holders a higher, $70-a-share price is "a fairly effective method of blocking" the Stena-Tiphook bid.
<PERSON>Michael Carstens</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Tucker Anthony & R.L. Day</ORGANIZATION>, added that the sale of assets would allow <ORGANIZATION>Sea Containers</ORGANIZATION> to focus on its core container businesses. 
<ORGANIZATION>Sea Containers</ORGANIZATION> said the offer will proceed after the <ORGANIZATION>Bermuda Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> lifts or modifies an interim injunction restraining the company from buying its shares.
That injunction resulted from litigation between <ORGANIZATION>Temple</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sea Containers</ORGANIZATION> last May. 
The maker of farm equipment said the three-year labor agreement with the <ORGANIZATION>International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>John Deere Horicon Works</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Deere</ORGANIZATION>'s primary facility for producing lawn and grounds-care equipment, takes effect immediately and extends through Oct. 1, 1992.
You'd think all the stories about well-heeled communities and developers getting <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> grants would prompt <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to tighten up on upscale housing subsidies.
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> has just made it easier for the affluent to qualify for insured loans from the deficit-ridden <ORGANIZATION>Federal Housing Administration</ORGANIZATION>.
It appears that the only thing <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> is learning from the <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> story is how to enlarge its control of the honey pot going to special interests. 
Last week, housing lobbies persuaded <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to raise the ceiling to $124,875, making <ORGANIZATION>FHA</ORGANIZATION> loans more accessible to the well-to-do.
But the higher mortgage ceiling is only the starter kit for what Senator <PERSON>Alan Cranston</PERSON> and Majority Leader <PERSON>George Mitchell</PERSON> have in mind for housing.
Because a purchaser can use an <ORGANIZATION>FHA</ORGANIZATION> loan to finance all points and closing costs, the <ORGANIZATION>FHA</ORGANIZATION> can wind up lending more than a house is worth.
We hear that <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Jack Kemp</PERSON> is toying with going along with some of the <PERSON>Cranston-Mitchell</PERSON> proposals.
A group of 27 Senators has written <PERSON>Mr. Kemp</PERSON> urging him to reject <PERSON>Cranston-Mitchell</PERSON> and focus on programs that empower the poor rather than create vast new government obligations.
But even if he agrees, <PERSON>Mr. Kemp</PERSON> doesn't write the nation's housing law -- <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> does.
Exhibit A is last week's <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> vote to fund 40 pet projects out of the same discretionary fund that is at the heart of the <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> scandal.
More and more observers now realize that the key to ending future <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> scandals lies in forcing <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to clean up its own act.
This week, a <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> Sun editorial said the Lantos subcommittee on <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> should forget about <PERSON>Sam Pierce</PERSON>'s testimony for the moment and call some other witnesses: the various congressional sponsors of the 40 pork-barrel projects.
The Sun concluded that <PERSON>Mr. Pierce</PERSON> is only part of the problem -- and a part that's gone. "If <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> is to be reformed," it concluded, Members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> will "have to start looking into, and doing something about, the practices of their colleagues." 
Courtaulds' restructuring is among the largest thus far in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, though it is dwarfed by <ORGANIZATION>B.A.T Industries PLC</ORGANIZATION>'s plans to spin off roughly #4 billion in assets to help fend off a takeover bid from Anglo-French financier Sir <PERSON>James Goldsmith</PERSON>.
Even without a specific takeover threat, Courtaulds is giving shareholders "choice and value," said <PERSON>Julia Blake</PERSON>, an analyst at <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> stockbrokers <ORGANIZATION>Barclays de Zoete Wedd</ORGANIZATION>. 
Anyone wondering about the subject's importance, however, should ask <PERSON>Nigel Lawson</PERSON>, who resigned last week as <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON>'s Chancellor of the Exchequer amid political turmoil generated by <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s drift toward stagflation.
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s inflation probably is traceable in part to <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>'s failure to get the pound-deutsche mark exchange rate right. 
If <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> monetary policy goes astray it will have repercussions well beyond those that unseated the estimable <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>WDB</ORGANIZATION> model in question is a product of an upstart economics shop called <ORGANIZATION>Bell Mueller Cannon Inc.</ORGANIZATION> (BMC).
When <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs</ORGANIZATION> challenged the <ORGANIZATION>BMC</ORGANIZATION> recession forecast in its economic newsletter a few weeks ago, the <ORGANIZATION>BMC</ORGANIZATION> folks were delighted.
So they fired back at the <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs</ORGANIZATION> objections in their own economics letter, "The BMC Report." They also arranged a luncheon in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to further explain their forecast and solicit new clients. 
President <PERSON>Jeffrey Bell</PERSON> in 1978 upset longtime <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> Republican Senator <PERSON>Clifford Case</PERSON> in a primary and made an unsuccessful run at <PERSON>Bill Bradley</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> seat.
<PERSON>John Mueller</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>BMC</ORGANIZATION>'s vice president and chief economist, spent 10 years on the staff of Rep. <PERSON>Jack Kemp</PERSON>, sharpening his political skills and providing analysis to back up the congressman's supply-side arguments.
An article on these pages by <PERSON>Mr. Mueller</PERSON> on June 29 touched off the debate with <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs</ORGANIZATION>.
It defined the <ORGANIZATION>WDB</ORGANIZATION> as not only currency and commercial bank reserves created by the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION>, but also the sum of dollar reserves held by foreign central banks. "The world dollar base, in fact, is analogous to the world stock of monetary gold under the classical gold standard," wrote <PERSON>Mr. Mueller</PERSON>.
<ORGANIZATION>BMC</ORGANIZATION> says it was able to predict the rise in inflation in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> early this year from observing rapid growth in the world dollar base.
<ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs</ORGANIZATION> snapped back that the <ORGANIZATION>WDB</ORGANIZATION> is not an accurate predictive tool because dollar reserves in central banks do not dictate how much money there is in the world. "The Bundesbank might be rather surprised to be told that dollar purchases and sales were their only instrument for monetary policy!" observed <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs</ORGANIZATION>. "Instead, the supply of money in foreign countries can be (and is) expanded and contracted through open-market operations just as is the case in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
Foreign central banks buy or sell government securities to add or drain reserves from the banking system." <ORGANIZATION>BMC</ORGANIZATION> replied, yes, but in any monetary system there is one "final asset in which all forms of credit are ultimately payable" and today that final asset is the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollar. 
Whatever track record <ORGANIZATION>BMC</ORGANIZATION> is able to achieve, any debate is welcome that focuses on the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollar as the world's primary instrument for trade and investment among nations and the dominant foreign currency held by central banks.
But that cherished notion may have influenced <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON> to peg the pound too low, causing <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> to import all of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s inflationary pressures.
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> monetary policies ultimately will determine whether other nations are willing to accept <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> economic hegemony.
On the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Four Seasons</ORGANIZATION> gained C$1.50 to C$35.75 in light trading.
The <ORGANIZATION>Four Seasons</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said <PERSON>Mr. Sharp</PERSON>, who has an 81% voting stake in the company, has no current plans to sell his interest.
<ORGANIZATION>Bouygues S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, a diversified construction concern based in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, said its consolidated profit for the 1989 first half, after payments to minority interests, surged to 188 million French francs ($30.2 million) from 65 million francs a year earlier. 
Tenders for the bills, available in minimum $10,000 denominations, must be received by 1 p.m. EST Monday at the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> or at <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> banks or branches. 
But the pace slowed quickly following the round of arbitrage-related buying, involving the sale of index futures contracts and the purchase of stocks, and stayed sluggish through the rest of the session as prices drifted. "People are sitting on their hands," said <PERSON>Bill Langevin</PERSON>, manager of institutional trading at <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Keegan & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn</LOCATION>. 
The market has begun a process of "trying to find a floor" after its fall, said <PERSON>William M. LeFevre</PERSON>, a market strategist at <ORGANIZATION>Advest Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Hartford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Chevron</ORGANIZATION> gained 7/8 to 67 1/4 in <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> composite trading of 2.1 million shares amid continued speculation that <ORGANIZATION>Pennzoil</ORGANIZATION> is building a stake in the company.
<ORGANIZATION>USA Today</ORGANIZATION> reported that an unknown party -- possibly <ORGANIZATION>Pennzoil</ORGANIZATION> -- acting on its own or with a partner holds between 3.5% and 4.7% of the company's common shares. 
Other strong performers among blue-chip issues included <ORGANIZATION>Procter & Gamble</ORGANIZATION>, which went up 2 3/8 to 127 3/4; <ORGANIZATION>Aluminum Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, up 1 to 69 1/4, and <ORGANIZATION>Primerica</ORGANIZATION>, up 3/4 to 28 1/4.
<ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION> moved up 4 to 175 on reports that <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON> has asked <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION> unions if they're interested in cooperating with him in a new bid for <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>.
But neither the pilots nor the machinists appear interested, and <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON> is barred from making a new bid under terms of an agreement he made with <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> in September, unless <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> accepts an offer below $300 a share. 
Unisys went down 1 to 15 1/4 on 1.3 million shares and <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard</ORGANIZATION> skidded 2 3/8 to 47, but <ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment</ORGANIZATION> rose 1 3/8 to 90 1/2 and <ORGANIZATION>Compaq Computer</ORGANIZATION> added 1 to 101 5/8.
One series of dividend-related trades accounted for most of the volume in <ORGANIZATION>Southern Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s most active issue, which closed down 1/8 to 27 1/4 on 5.2 million shares.
<ORGANIZATION>H.F. Ahmanson</ORGANIZATION> rose 3/8 to 19 1/8, <ORGANIZATION>Great Western Financial</ORGANIZATION> gained 5/8 to 19 3/4, <ORGANIZATION>Golden West Financial</ORGANIZATION> added 1/2 to 26 3/8 and <ORGANIZATION>CalFed</ORGANIZATION> went up 1/2 to 23 1/4. 
Other precious-metals stocks finished mixed after rallying late last week; Homestake Mining went down 1/8 to 16 3/4, <ORGANIZATION>Newmont Gold</ORGANIZATION> added 7/8 to 41 1/4 and <ORGANIZATION>ASA Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> slid 1/2 to 49 1/8. 
<ORGANIZATION>Paramount Communications</ORGANIZATION> dropped 1 to 54 3/4 amid rumors that the $3.35 billion sale of its <ORGANIZATION>Associates Corp.</ORGANIZATION> unit to <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor</ORGANIZATION> could be delayed until mid-November.
<LOCATION>Nashua</LOCATION> jumped 4 1/2 to 33 1/2 despite taking steps to ward off <ORGANIZATION>Reiss & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Dutch</LOCATION> company that is seeking <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> antitrust clearance to acquire as much as 25% of its common stock.
<PERSON>James Clarkson</PERSON> retired as chairman, president and chief executive officer of the <LOCATION>Pontiac</LOCATION>, Mich.-based bank holding company, which said it is reviewing certain unspecified actions <PERSON>Mr. Clarkson</PERSON> took while in office.

David Gordon/Pick Up Company: For 2 1/2 years <PERSON>Mr. Gordon</PERSON> has been weaving regionally inspired words, music and movement into a tapestry of <LOCATION>Americana</LOCATION>, "<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>." Now the completed work, five self-contained sections stretching over two evenings, can be seen -- at the <ORGANIZATION>State University of New York</ORGANIZATION> at Purchase (Theatre B, 914-251-6200), Nov. 3-4.

Music Hall at <LOCATION>Fair Park</LOCATION>.
Waverly Consort opens its 25th anniversary season with a fully staged production of "Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria" ("The Return of Ulysses to His Homeland"), from the <LOCATION>Monteverdi</LOCATION> trilogy that also includes "Orfeo" and "L'incoronazione di <LOCATION>Poppea</LOCATION>." The cast of 13 singers is lead by <PERSON>Paul Rowe</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Ulisse</ORGANIZATION>), <PERSON>Laura Pudwell</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Penelope</LOCATION>) and <PERSON>Laurie Monahan</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Melanto</ORGANIZATION>), with an original-instrument Venetian opera orchestra of 20 instrumentalists.
<PERSON>Kathryn Bache Miller Theatre</PERSON>, Broadway at 116th Street, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
He is a senior partner with the law firm of <ORGANIZATION>Riordan & McKinzie</ORGANIZATION> and is a partner in <LOCATION>Riordan</LOCATION> Venture Management. 
<PERSON>Bonnie J. Stedt</PERSON> was named an executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>American Express Travel Related Services Co.</ORGANIZATION> unit of this travel and financial services firm.
<ORGANIZATION>Chemical</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Steven Edelson</PERSON> resigned recently, but one individual close to the situation said the resignation was forced.
A separate inquiry by <ORGANIZATION>Chemical</ORGANIZATION> cleared <PERSON>Mr. Edelson</PERSON> of allegations that he had been lavishly entertained by a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> money broker.
-- <ORGANIZATION>Chemical</ORGANIZATION> named <PERSON>James Kennedy</PERSON>, a trader in swaps contracts for the bank, to assume <PERSON>Mr. Edelson</PERSON>'s duties and to be trading manager for derivative products, including swaps and interest-rate options. 
-- <PERSON>Lee Wakeman</PERSON>, vice president in charge of options research who discovered the valuation errors and was asked by senior management to straighten out the mess, resigned to take a position in asset and liability management at <ORGANIZATION>Continental Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Wakeman</PERSON>, whom <ORGANIZATION>Chemical</ORGANIZATION> tried to keep, didn't return calls for comment. 
Separately, <ORGANIZATION>Chemical</ORGANIZATION> confirmed that it took an undisclosed charge in the second quarter for losses on forward-rate agreements involving foreign currency written by its branch in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> leaders traded proposals aimed at speeding action on legislation to narrow the deficit and raise the federal government's debt limit -- but the major stumbling block remains President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s proposal to cut the capital-gains tax rate. 
The talks between <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON>George Mitchell</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> and his GOP counterpart, <PERSON>Sen. Robert Dole</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, are expected to resume today. 
Last night, after meeting with <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> and administration officials at the White House, <PERSON>Mr. Dole</PERSON> proposed streamlining the fiscal 1990 deficit-reduction bill, now stalled in a <ORGANIZATION>House-Senate</ORGANIZATION> conference committee, and passing a long-term extension of the federal debt ceiling without any accompanying amendments. 
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Democrats are to meet today to consider the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> proposal. 
Yesterday, <PERSON>Mr. Dole</PERSON> seemed weary of the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration's strategy of pushing the capital-gains measure at every chance in the face of Democratic procedural hurdles.
Pressed by Chairman <PERSON>Dan Rostenkowski</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>) of the <ORGANIZATION>House Ways and Means Committee</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON>Robert Glauber</PERSON> told a congressional hearing that the administration would give up its demand for the capital-gains tax cut if faced with a potential default. 
Most of the 10 analysts polled last week by <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones International News Service</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> expect the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollar to ease only mildly in November.
In <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Wednesday, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> currency was trading at about 142.95 yen at midmorning, up from 142.80 yen at the opening and up from Tuesday's <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> close of 142.15 yen. 
<PERSON>David Owen</PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION>Kleinwort Benson & Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, said he expects further cuts in short-term <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> rates in an effort to encourage a narrowing of the trade gap and to ensure a soft landing in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economy. 
<PERSON>Robert White</PERSON>, a vice president and manager of corporate trade at <ORGANIZATION>First Interstate of California</ORGANIZATION>, agreed with that view and predicted the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> federal funds rate will drop to between 7 3/4% and 8% within 60 days from its current level at 8 13/16%.
<ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> funds is the rate banks charge each other on overnight loans; the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> influences the rate by adding or draining reserves from the banking system. 
<PERSON>Mr. White</PERSON> also predicted a half-point cut in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> discount rate in the near future.
In last month's survey, a number of currency analysts predicted the dollar would be pressured by a narrowing of interest rate differentials between the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>. 
Several other European central banks, notably in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, followed the West German <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION>'s lead by raising their own key rates.
After a surprisingly sharp widening in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> August merchandise trade deficit -- $10.77 billion from a revised $8.24 billion in July and well above expectations -- and a startling 190-point drop in stock prices on Oct. 13, the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> relaxed short-term interest rates, knocking fed funds from around 9% to 8 3/4%. 
But predictions that central banks of the <ORGANIZATION>Group of Seven</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>G-7</ORGANIZATION>) major industrial nations would continue their massive dollar sales went astray, as the market drove the dollar downward on its own, reacting to Wall Street's plunge and subsequent price volatility, lower <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> interest rates and signs of a slowing <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economy.
<ORGANIZATION>G-7</ORGANIZATION> consists of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Tomoshige Kakita</PERSON>, senior deputy manager in the treasury department of <ORGANIZATION>Mitsui Bank Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, suggested that uncertainty about <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stocks and bonds has made Japanese investors leery of holding those securities in the near term, thus damping dollar demand. 
But, <PERSON>Mr. Kakita</PERSON> added, once <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> equities regain some stability, players will move back into dollar-denominated investments, especially Treasury bonds, whose value rises when interest rates decline. 
<PERSON>Jens-Uwe Fischer</PERSON>, a senior trader at <ORGANIZATION>Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, said he expects the dollar to recover within the next three months to around 1.88 marks as <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economic data, particularly <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade figures, level off.
He contended that the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> won't ease rates further, but predicted <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> officials will relax key rates in <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Alfred Zapfel</PERSON>, chief trader at <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Boston</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, took an opposite stance.
<PERSON>Scott Greene</PERSON>, chief foreign exchange dealer with <ORGANIZATION>Julius Baer & Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, fits the description of a "great dollar bear." He predicted the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unit will skid below 1.80 marks to around 1.78 marks this month and 1.75 marks by the beginning of the new year. 
<PERSON>Mr. Owen</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Kleinwort Benson</ORGANIZATION> suggested that the new chancellor, <PERSON>John Major</PERSON>, will take a tough line in his autumn statement later this month, helping to underpin the pound.
On the <ORGANIZATION>Commodity Exchange</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, gold for current delivery dropped $3.10 to $374.70 an ounce in moderate trading.
Christopher Hill in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Nicholas Hastings</PERSON> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Erik Kirschbaum</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Caitlin Randall</PERSON> and <PERSON>Douglas Appell</PERSON> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> contributed to this article. 
<ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s $3.18 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION>Great Northern Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION> helped drive the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 41.60 points, to 2645.08, in active trading.
Analysts said the offer for <ORGANIZATION>Great Northern Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION> broke the pall that settled over the takeover business for the past three weeks in the wake of the collapsed <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION> buy-out.
<ORGANIZATION>Great Northern Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION> soared $20.125 a share, to $62.875, substantially above the $58 a share <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> is offering.
Although the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> is expected to announce details of its November quarterly refunding operation today, the Nov. 79 schedule could be delayed unless <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and the president act soon to lift the nation's debt ceiling. 
Every workday at 11 a.m., 40-year-old <PERSON>Mike Sinyard</PERSON> dons cycling clothes, hops on a bike he keeps at his <LOCATION>Morgan Hill</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, office and sets out to cover a distance most people would travel only by car.
One large competitor after another is leaping into the booming market Specialized helped create, turning out mountain bikes with such well-known names as <ORGANIZATION>Schwinn</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Peugeot</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Raleigh</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Nishiki</ORGANIZATION>. 
It is a problem common to small companies that have grown fast -- especially when their success attracts big-time competitors. "The big word around Specialized is passion," says <PERSON>Erik Eidsmo</PERSON>, a former ski-industry executive whom <PERSON>Mr. Sinyard</PERSON> recruited from <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> to run marketing and sales. "What I hope to bring to this is another word: process.
<PERSON>Mr. Eidsmo</PERSON> is one of several key people from outside the cycling industry who were hired to bring the free-wheeling, fast-growing company under tighter control. "We had a lot of problems," <PERSON>Mr. Sinyard</PERSON> says.
Since his arrival in May, <PERSON>Mr. Eidsmo</PERSON> has put in place techniques learned while working for <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>, such as management-by-objective, detailed project plans and forecasts of company sales and product trends. "We're finally getting -- and it's been very painful -- some understanding of what the company's long-term horizon should begin to look like," <PERSON>Mr. Eidsmo</PERSON> says. "But it's risky," he says of Specialized's attempt to adopt a corporate structure. "You don't want to lose the magic" of the company's creative drive. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Cycling Federation official <PERSON>Philip Milburn</PERSON> says mountain biking is "growing at such a monstrous rate that a lot of companies are getting into this." 
To get a piece of the business, <ORGANIZATION>Nike Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Beaverton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, introduced a line of mountain-bike shoes.
About a month ago, <ORGANIZATION>Michelin Tire Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Greenville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, began selling mountain-bike tires, for years a Specialized stronghold. 
<ORGANIZATION>Trek Bicycle Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which accounts for one-quarter of the $400 million in annual sales at its Milwaukee-based parent, <ORGANIZATION>Intrepid Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, entered the mountain-bike business in 1983.
Trek previously made only traditional road bikes, but "it didn't take a rocket scientist to change a road bike into a mountain bike," says <PERSON>Trek</PERSON>'s president, <PERSON>Dick Burke</PERSON>.
At <ORGANIZATION>Giant Bicycle Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Rancho Dominguez</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, sales have tripled since the company entered the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> mountain-bike business in 1987.
A subsidiary of a Taiwanese holding company with world-wide sales of $150 million, <ORGANIZATION>Giant</ORGANIZATION> is one example of the sudden globalization of <PERSON>Mr. Sinyard</PERSON>'s once-cozy market niche.
<ORGANIZATION>Schwinn Bicycle Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, established joint ventures with bike companies in mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> to sell bikes.
In the past year, <ORGANIZATION>Derby International Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION>, has acquired such major brands as <ORGANIZATION>Peugeot</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Raleigh</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Nishiki</ORGANIZATION>. 
But as <PERSON>Bill Austin</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Giant</ORGANIZATION>'s president, puts it, "With some of the bigger players consolidating their strength, the game has changed." 
Under the plan, <ORGANIZATION>Gillette South Africa</ORGANIZATION> will sell manufacturing facilities in <LOCATION>Springs</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, and its business in toiletries and plastic bags to <ORGANIZATION>Twins Pharmaceuticals Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, an affiliate of <ORGANIZATION>Anglo American Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a South African company. 
<ORGANIZATION>Gillette</ORGANIZATION> said its continued presence in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> "enables it to make meaningful contributions to South African society, to the lives of its employees and to the communities in which it operates." <ORGANIZATION>Gillette South Africa</ORGANIZATION> employs about 250 people.
About 60% of the work force will continue with <ORGANIZATION>Gillette</ORGANIZATION> or transfer to <ORGANIZATION>Twins Pharmaceuticals</ORGANIZATION>, the company said. 
A governing body of both the <ORGANIZATION>Financial Accounting Standards Board</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Governmental Accounting Standards Board</ORGANIZATION> voted to give the <ORGANIZATION>FASB</ORGANIZATION> jurisdiction over accounting standards for certain government-owned entities. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Financial Accounting Foundation</ORGANIZATION> voted 12-2 that <ORGANIZATION>FASB</ORGANIZATION> accounting rules supercede <ORGANIZATION>GASB</ORGANIZATION> rules in regard to utilities, hospitals, and colleges and universities owned by the government.
After the <ORGANIZATION>GASB</ORGANIZATION> was founded in 1984, 11 years after the <ORGANIZATION>FASB</ORGANIZATION>, the government-owned entities were supposed to follow <ORGANIZATION>FASB</ORGANIZATION> rules unless the <ORGANIZATION>GASB</ORGANIZATION> superceded them.
The <ORGANIZATION>GASB</ORGANIZATION> had told governments they didn't have to follow <ORGANIZATION>FASB</ORGANIZATION> rules on depreciation, making it difficult for bond-rating agencies to compare private and state-owned schools, which compete in the public bond market. 
But it may lead to separate financial reports based on different rules for the government entities under <ORGANIZATION>FASB</ORGANIZATION> rules and those still under <ORGANIZATION>GASB</ORGANIZATION> rules. 
Under attack by its own listed companies and powerful floor traders, the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> is considering reinstituting a "collar" on program trading that it abandoned last year, according to people familiar with the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>. 
But in an interview in which he called the stock market's volatility a "national problem," <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>John J. Phelan Jr.</PERSON> said, "We are going to try to do some things in the short intermediate term" to help the situation. 
<PERSON>Mr. Phelan</PERSON> said that the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> has been trying to deal quietly with the issue, but that banning computer-assisted trading strategies entirely, as some investors want, would be like "taking everybody out of an automobile and making them ride a horse." 
Early last year, after a 140-point, one-day drop in the Dow, the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> instituted the collar, which banned program trading through the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s computers whenever the <ORGANIZATION>Dow</ORGANIZATION> moved 50 points up or down in a day.
"The collar was penetrated on a number of occasions," meaning securities firms figured out ways to conduct program trades to circumvent the collar and use the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s electronic trading system, <PERSON>Mr. Phelan</PERSON> said.
<ORGANIZATION>American Express Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ORGANIZATION> unit said it ceased all index-arbitrage program trading for client accounts.
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>, which in September was the 11th-biggest program trader on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>, had already suspended stock-index arbitrage for its own account. 
Also, <ORGANIZATION>CS First Boston Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp.</ORGANIZATION> unit, the fifth-biggest program trader in September, is "preparing a response" to the program-trading outcry, officials of the firm said.
<PERSON>Mr. Phelan</PERSON> is an adroit diplomat who normally appears to be solidly in control of the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s factions.
<PERSON>Mr. Phelan</PERSON>'s recent remarks that investors simply must get used to the stock-market volatility from program trading have drawn criticism from both the exchange's stock specialists, who make markets in individual stocks, and from many companies that have shares listed on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>. 
For example, in a special meeting Monday with <PERSON>Mr. Phelan</PERSON>, senior officials of some of the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s 49 stock specialist firms complained that the exchange is no longer representing their interests. "We are looking for representation we haven't had," a specialist said. "We've had dictation." 
After another session <PERSON>Mr. Phelan</PERSON> held yesterday with major brokerage firms such as <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION> -- all of which have engaged in program trading -- an executive of a top brokerage firm said, "Clearly, the firms want the exchange to take leadership." 
Many specialist firms resent the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s new "basket" product that allows institutions to buy or sell all stocks in the <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor</ORGANIZATION>'s 500-stock index in one shot.
<PERSON>Mr. Phelan</PERSON> has had difficulty convincing the public that the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> is serious about curbing volatility, especially as the exchange clearly relishes its role as the home for $200 billion in stock-index funds, which buy huge baskets of stocks to mimic popular stock-market indexes like the <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor</ORGANIZATION>'s 500, and which sometimes employ program trading.
The <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> wants to keep such index funds from fleeing to overseas markets, but only as long as it "handles it intelligently," <PERSON>Mr. Phelan</PERSON> said. 
Indeed, <PERSON>Mr. Phelan</PERSON> said that if stock-market volatility persists, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> may lose its edge as being the best place to raise capital. "<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s markets are more stable," he said. "If that continues, a significant number of {<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>} companies will go over there to raise money." 
In coming days, when the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> formulates its responses to the program-trading problem, <PERSON>Mr. Phelan</PERSON> may take a more public role in the issue. 
<PERSON>Lewis L. Glucksman</PERSON>, vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, said: "This is a problem that's taking on a life of its own.
A NEW MINIMUM-WAGE PLAN has been worked out by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, opening the way for the first increase in over nine years.
<ORGANIZATION>Great Northern Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION> reacted coolly to <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s takeover bid of $58 a share, or $3.19 billion, though the suitor said all terms are negotiable.
<ORGANIZATION>Time Warner</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> could end up becoming partners in several business ventures as part of a settlement of their dispute over <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> producers <PERSON>Peter Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jon Peters</PERSON>. 
A bidding war for <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> became more likely as <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> unexpectedly decided to end restrictions blocking a takeover of the luxury car maker. 
<PERSON>Mr. Simonds-Gooding</PERSON> said the additional financing may leave <ORGANIZATION>British Satellite</ORGANIZATION> owned by about 20 investors, including Australian entrepreneur <PERSON>Alan Bond</PERSON>, whose nearly 36% stake would be reduced to as little as 20%. 
<ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, British Satellite's biggest investor, would like to withdraw from the satellite-TV consortium, and analysts have speculated <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION> studios might buy the Bond stake.
<ORGANIZATION>Besides Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, British Satellite's other backers include <ORGANIZATION>Pearson PLC</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Reed International PLC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Granada Group PLC</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Simonds-Gooding</PERSON> conceded that British Satellite's potential <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> lenders "are saying, `When you're on the air, you'll {actually} get the money. '" The bankers also insist that the loans depend on the consortium raising more money from new and existing backers. 
British Satellite faces competition from <ORGANIZATION>Sky Television</ORGANIZATION>, a satellite-TV venture begun last February and owned by <PERSON>Rupert Murdoch</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>News Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>LTV Steel</ORGANIZATION>, which is a unit of Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION>LTV Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, noted that steel prices, adjusted for inflation, increased only 1.7% between 1981 and the fourth quarter of 1988, while the prices of other industrial commodities increased nearly five times as much.
Moreover, they note that <ORGANIZATION>LTV</ORGANIZATION> may be trying to send a signal to major customers, such as <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Whirlpool Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, that steelmakers need more money.
"They {LTV} may believe this can impact contract negotiations and is their signal to the world that now is the time to get tough on prices," said <PERSON>Peter Marcus</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Marcus</PERSON> believes spot steel prices will continue to fall through early 1990 and then reverse themselves.
In composite <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>LTV</ORGANIZATION> common shares fell 12.5 cents to close at $1.50. 
<PERSON>Joe F. Lynch</PERSON>, the 56-year-old chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>First Continental Real Estate Investment Trust</ORGANIZATION>, was named to the new post of vice chairman of this bank holding company. 
<PERSON>Robert C. Snyder</PERSON>, a director and chief operating officer of the company, succeeds <PERSON>Mr. Pfeiffer</PERSON> as president. 
Paper and forest-products stocks were especially strong, as the offer for <ORGANIZATION>Great Northern Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> triggered speculation that the industry could be in for a wave of merger activity. 
<ORGANIZATION>Great Northern</ORGANIZATION> surged 20 1/8 to 62 7/8, well above <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s offering price of $58 a share, amid speculation that other suitors for the company would surface or that the bid would be raised.
With stocks having been battered lately because of the collapse of takeover offers for <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>, the parent company of <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, analysts viewed the proposal as a psychological lift for the market. 
The $3.18 billion bid, which had been rumored since last week, "creates a better feeling that there's value in the market at current levels and renews prospects for a hot tape," says <PERSON>A.C. Moore</PERSON>, director of research at <ORGANIZATION>Argus Research Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
"People are looking for an ability to try and read the market, rather than be manipulated," said <PERSON>Dudley A. Eppel</PERSON>, manager of equity trading at <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette</ORGANIZATION>.
Within the paper sector, <ORGANIZATION>Mead</ORGANIZATION> climbed 2 3/8 to 38 3/4 on 1.3 million shares, <ORGANIZATION>Union Camp</ORGANIZATION> rose 2 3/4 to 37 3/4, <ORGANIZATION>Federal Paper Board</ORGANIZATION> added 1 3/4 to 23 7/8, <PERSON>Bowater</PERSON> gained 1 1/2 to 27 1/2, <ORGANIZATION>Stone Container</ORGANIZATION> rose 1 to 26 1/8 and <LOCATION>Temple-Inland</LOCATION> jumped 3 3/4 to 62 1/4. 
Forest-products issues showing strength included Champion International, which went up 1 3/8 to 31 7/8; <PERSON>Weyerhaeuser</PERSON>, up 3/4 to 27 1/4; <LOCATION>Louisiana-Pacific</LOCATION>, up 1 1/8 to 40 3/8, and <ORGANIZATION>Boise Cascade</ORGANIZATION>, up 5/8 to 42. 
Pfizer gained 1 7/8 to 67 5/8, <ORGANIZATION>Schering-Plough</ORGANIZATION> added 2 1/4 to 75 3/4, <ORGANIZATION>Eli Lilly</ORGANIZATION> rose 1 3/8 to 62 1/8 and <ORGANIZATION>Upjohn</ORGANIZATION> firmed 3/4 to 38. 
An <ORGANIZATION>advisory committee of the Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION> recommended that the agency approve <PERSON>Eminase</PERSON>, the company's heart drug. 
Two rumored restructuring candidates in the oil industry moved higher: <ORGANIZATION>Chevron</ORGANIZATION>, which rose 1 3/4 to 68 1/4 on 3.5 million shares, and <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION>, which gained 1 1/4 to 34 5/8.
<ORGANIZATION>Pennzoil</ORGANIZATION> is rumored to be accumulating a stake in <LOCATION>Chevron</LOCATION> in order to push for a revamping of the company; investor <PERSON>Carl Icahn</PERSON> has recently increased his stake in <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION>, which separately reported earnings that were in line with expectations. 
<ORGANIZATION>Paramount Communications</ORGANIZATION>, which completed the $3.35 billion sale of its <ORGANIZATION>Associates Corp.</ORGANIZATION> financial-services unit to <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor</ORGANIZATION>, gained 1 1/8 to 55 7/8 after losing one point Monday amid rumors of a delay.
<ORGANIZATION>Shaw Industries</ORGANIZATION>, which agreed to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong World Industries</ORGANIZATION>' carpet operations for an undisclosed price, rose 2 1/4 to 26 1/8.
<ORGANIZATION>MCI Communications Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it won a $27 million contract from <ORGANIZATION>Stuart-James Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> investment banking concern, to provide voice and data telecommunications services. 
<ORGANIZATION>Stelco</ORGANIZATION> said it has an option to lease a 350,000-square-foot building in <LOCATION>Brantford</LOCATION> and proposes to spend 24.5 million Canadian dollars (US$20.9 million) on the facility.
When <PERSON>Thomas W. Wathen</PERSON> went big league last year, he acquired a treasure-trove of Americana along with a well-known but ailing security business: <ORGANIZATION>Pinkerton's Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
There was a wanted poster offering "Rewards for the Arrest of Express and Train Robbers <PERSON>Frank James</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jesse W. James</PERSON>" and the original <ORGANIZATION>Pinkerton's</ORGANIZATION> logo with an open eye and the inscription "We Never Sleep," which inspired the phrase "private eye." Then there were two gold watches once owned by <PERSON>Allan Pinkerton</PERSON>, who founded the company in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> in 1850.
The missing watch is emblematic of the problems <PERSON>Mr. Wathen</PERSON> encountered in building his closely held <ORGANIZATION>California Plant Protection Security Service</ORGANIZATION> into the largest detective and security agency in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> through acquisitions.
<PERSON>Mr. Wathen</PERSON>, who started his career as an <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> investigator and worked as a security officer for several large companies, built his <ORGANIZATION>California Plant Protection</ORGANIZATION> from a tiny mom-and-pop security patrol firm here in the <LOCATION>San Fernando Valley</LOCATION>.
Yet although <ORGANIZATION>California Plant Protection</ORGANIZATION> was netting bigger and bigger clients -- the firm provided security for the 1984 Summer Olympics in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> -- it still didn't have the name recognition of <ORGANIZATION>Pinkerton's</ORGANIZATION>.
So when <ORGANIZATION>American Brands Inc.</ORGANIZATION> decided to sell the unit in 1987 as part of a divestiture of its food and security industries operations, <PERSON>Mr. Wathen</PERSON> saw a chance to accomplish several objectives. 
<PERSON>Mr. Wathen</PERSON> also relished the chance to demonstrate an entrepreneur like himself, who'd spent his whole career in the security business, could run <ORGANIZATION>Pinkerton's</ORGANIZATION> better than an unfocused conglomerate or investment banker. "The security business is my favorite subject.
Five years of rapid expansion under <ORGANIZATION>American Brands</ORGANIZATION>, with an emphasis on marketing the agency's services instead of improving them, had hurt <ORGANIZATION>Pinkerton's</ORGANIZATION> profits, <PERSON>Mr. Wathen</PERSON> claims.
<ORGANIZATION>American Brands</ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on <PERSON>Mr. Wathen</PERSON>'s accusations. 
The acquisition combined the country's second-largest security company, <ORGANIZATION>Pinkerton's</ORGANIZATION>, with 1987 sales of $410 million, and the fourth largest, <ORGANIZATION>California Plant Protection</ORGANIZATION>, with $250 million in sales, creating the industry's biggest firm, which took on the <ORGANIZATION>Pinkerton's</ORGANIZATION> name.
Even after divesting itself of $120 million of unprofitable business, the new <ORGANIZATION>Pinkerton's</ORGANIZATION> will have sales of about $610 million this year and operating profit roughly double the industry average of 2%-3% of sales, says <PERSON>Lloyd Greif</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Sutro & Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, which arranged the <ORGANIZATION>Pinkerton's</ORGANIZATION> acquisition. 
<ORGANIZATION>Pinkerton's</ORGANIZATION> world headquarters today is a nondescript, two-story office building across the street from the small <LOCATION>Van Nuys Airport</LOCATION>. 
Next, <PERSON>Mr. Wathen</PERSON> raised <ORGANIZATION>Pinkerton's</ORGANIZATION> rates, which were 75-cents-an-hour lower than <ORGANIZATION>California Plant Protection</ORGANIZATION>'s average rate of around $8.63.
<PERSON>Mr. Wathen</PERSON>, who says <ORGANIZATION>Pinkerton's</ORGANIZATION> had a loss of nearly $8 million in 1987 under <ORGANIZATION>American Brands</ORGANIZATION>, boasts that he's made <ORGANIZATION>Pinkerton's</ORGANIZATION> profitable again.
Last year, earnings of the combined companies didn't cover debt service and <ORGANIZATION>Pinkerton's</ORGANIZATION> was forced to borrow $20 million of subordinated debt. "We wouldn't have had to refinance if a lot of the problems hadn't been there," <PERSON>Mr. Wathen</PERSON> says.
The company recently filed suit in state court in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> against <ORGANIZATION>American Brands</ORGANIZATION>, seeking at least $40 million in damages from the <LOCATION>Old Greenwich</LOCATION>, Conn.-based company. 
The suit alleges that <ORGANIZATION>American Brands</ORGANIZATION> misrepresented the financial condition of <ORGANIZATION>Pinkerton's</ORGANIZATION> before the sale, failed to disclose pending lawsuits and material contracts in which <ORGANIZATION>Pinkerton's</ORGANIZATION> was in default, hadn't registered the <ORGANIZATION>Pinkerton's</ORGANIZATION> name and trademark in the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> and didn't tell <ORGANIZATION>California Plant Protection</ORGANIZATION> about some labor controversies. 
"We have previously had discussions with representatives of <ORGANIZATION>Pinkerton's Inc.</ORGANIZATION> concerning the {sale of the company} and we concluded that we did not have liability under the contract," says <ORGANIZATION>American Brands</ORGANIZATION>. "As this is now a litigation matter, we have no further comment." 
The lawsuit alleges that an inventory of <ORGANIZATION>Pinkerton's</ORGANIZATION> memorabilia disclosed that one of the watches hadn't been forked over by <ORGANIZATION>American Brands</ORGANIZATION>. "<ORGANIZATION>American Brand</ORGANIZATION>'s failure to surrender the gold watch has damaged new <ORGANIZATION>Pinkerton's</ORGANIZATION> in an amount as yet {to be} determined and deprived it of a valuable artifact for which it had bargained," the suit charges. 
The key to <ORGANIZATION>Pinkerton's</ORGANIZATION> future will be sticking to what it does best -- being a security company, says <PERSON>Mr. Wathen</PERSON>.
Although investigations now account for only about 5% of <ORGANIZATION>Pinkerton's</ORGANIZATION> total revenue, that side of the business has traditionally been the more "glamorous" of the two and it carries historical and sentimental value. (Author <PERSON>Dashiell Hammett</PERSON>, who wrote "The Maltese Falcon," was a former <ORGANIZATION>Pinkerton's</ORGANIZATION> detective.) 
<ORGANIZATION>American Brands</ORGANIZATION> "just had a different approach," <PERSON>Mr. Wathen</PERSON> says. "Their approach didn't work; mine is." 
The president said that he and the <LOCATION>Kremlin</LOCATION> leader would meet Dec. 2-3 aboard <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Soviet naval vessels in the <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> to discuss a wide range of issues without a formal agenda.
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said that neither he nor <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> expected any "substantial decisions or agreements." The seaborne meetings won't disrupt plans for a formal summit next spring or summer, at which an arms-control treaty is likely to be completed. 
<LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>'s army lifted a blockade around a Palestinian town in the occupied <LOCATION>West Bank</LOCATION>, ending a 42-day campaign of seizing cars, furniture and other goods to crush a tax boycott.
East German leader <PERSON>Krenz</PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> for talks today with <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> on restructuring proposals.
In <LOCATION>East Berlin</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> officials considered legalizing New Forum, the country's largest opposition alliance, as about 20,000 demonstrators staged protests in three cities to press demands for democratic freedoms. 
The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> approved a permanent smoking ban on nearly all domestic airline routes as part of a $27.1 billion transportation bill that must still overcome budget obstacles in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
<LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Ortega</LOCATION> postponed until today a decision on whether to end a 19-month-old cease-fire in the conflict with the <ORGANIZATION>Contra</ORGANIZATION> rebels.
In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> voted to condemn <PERSON>Ortega</PERSON>'s threat to cancel the truce, and <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said he would review <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION>Managua</LOCATION>, including the possibility of renewing military aid to the rebels. 
Chinese leader <PERSON>Deng</PERSON> told former President <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> was deeply involved in "the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion" that gripped <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> last spring.
<PERSON>Nixon</PERSON>, on the fourth day of a private visit to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, said that damage to Sino-U.S. relations was "very great," calling the situation "the most serious" since 1972. 
<LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>'s troops broke through a guerrilla blockade on the strategic <LOCATION>Salang Highway</LOCATION>, allowing trucks carrying food and other necessities to reach <LOCATION>Kabul</LOCATION> after a missile attack on rebel strongholds.
<LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION>'s legislature elected Prime Minister <PERSON>Ozal</PERSON> as the country's first civilian president since 1960, opening the way for a change of government under a new premier he will select.
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s government dismissed demands by right-wing Conservatives, the nation's main opposition party, for emergency talks on <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION>'s recent tolerance of dissent.
<LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> voted to hold a national referendum on an election to fill the new post of president.
A spokesman for Democratic <PERSON>Sen. Pell</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> said, however, that the <ORGANIZATION>Immigration and Naturalization Service</ORGANIZATION> would review the stowaway's request. 
CRESTMONT <ORGANIZATION>FEDERAL SAVINGS & LOAN ASSOCIATION</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Edison</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>) -- <PERSON>Lawrence B. Seidman</PERSON>, 41 years old, was named chairman of this savings and loan institution.
<PERSON>Mr. Seidman</PERSON>, a director of <ORGANIZATION>Crestmont</ORGANIZATION> since July, is general partner of <ORGANIZATION>Seidman Financial Associates</ORGANIZATION>, which owns 9.89% of <ORGANIZATION>Crestmont</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>CAMBREX Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Bayonne</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, declared its initial quarterly of five cents a share, payable Dec. 1 to stock of record Nov. 10.
But if, as many now fear, <ORGANIZATION>Waertsilae Marine</ORGANIZATION> joins the ranks of failed shipyards it might turn out to be remembered most as a blemish on <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION>'s international reputation.
Miami-based <ORGANIZATION>Carnival</ORGANIZATION> said the first of the three ships is scheduled to be delivered next month, just in time for the winter tourist season in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>.
However, some bankers cited possible parallels between the <ORGANIZATION>Waertsilae Marine</ORGANIZATION> case and the collapse of <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>'s state-owned <PERSON>Kongsberg Vappenfabrikk</PERSON> AS two years ago.
Government officials were expected to combine <ORGANIZATION>Waertsilae Marine</ORGANIZATION> with two other struggling firms, and thus ensure <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION>'s survival as a shipbuilding nation.
After the restructuring of <ORGANIZATION>Waertsilae Marine</ORGANIZATION> and bolstered by state loan guarantees, two big bank creditors, <ORGANIZATION>Union Bank of Finland</ORGANIZATION> and state-controlled <PERSON>Postipankki</PERSON>, resumed lending the shipyard working capital.
People familiar with Monday's board meeting said it was the state's refusal to explicitly reaffirm the credit guarantees that led <ORGANIZATION>Union Bank</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Postipankki</ORGANIZATION> to halt lending to <ORGANIZATION>Waertsilae Marine</ORGANIZATION>.
Then, in a boardroom showdown, state-appointed directors voted to file for bankruptcy, apparently under instructions from <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION>'s Industry Minister <PERSON>Ilkka Suominen</PERSON>. 
Analysts say <PERSON>Mr. Suominen</PERSON> had grown increasingly worried about the state's potential financial exposure as <ORGANIZATION>Waertsilae Marine</ORGANIZATION>'s losses ballooned to more than double the figure estimated in August.
Noting that <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> wound up wasting state subsidies of about 35 billion Swedish kronor ($5.47 billion) during the 1970s in a vain attempt to salvage its shipbuilding industry, one analyst suggested that <PERSON>Mr. Suominen</PERSON> may have decided to cut <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION>'s losses once and for all. 
<ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it will temporarily idle its <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, assembly plant for one week beginning Monday because of slow sales. 
The assembly plant builds the <ORGANIZATION>Cadillac DeVille</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Chevrolet Caprice</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera Wagon</ORGANIZATION>. 
In addition, <ORGANIZATION>GM's Truck & Bus Group</ORGANIZATION> said slow sales are forcing it to close its <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> assembly plant the week beginning Monday.
The No. 1 auto maker scheduled overtime this week at its <LOCATION>Janesville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION>, assembly plant, manufacturer of the <ORGANIZATION>Chevrolet Cavalier</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> slated overtime again this week at its <LOCATION>Wixom</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Wayne</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, assembly plants.
They build the <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln Town Car</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Mark VII</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Ford Escort</ORGANIZATION> and full-sized pickup trucks. 
<ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION> scheduled overtime this week at its <ORGANIZATION>St. Louis Assembly Plant No.</ORGANIZATION> 2, <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Del.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Sterling Heights</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, assembly plants.
They build extended minivans and the <ORGANIZATION>Dodge Spirit</ORGANIZATION>, Acclaim, Shadow and <ORGANIZATION>Sundance</ORGANIZATION>.

The surprise resignations of two top economic government officials heaped more uncertainty on <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s financial markets, which already have been laboring under worries about <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s ailing economy. 
"The last thing markets like is uncertainty," said <PERSON>Ian Harwood</PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION>S.G. Warburg & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, of the resignations of Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON>Nigel Lawson</PERSON> and chief economic adviser Sir <PERSON>Alan Walters</PERSON>. "I think you'll see share prices go down, and sterling now is under something of a cloud." 
London-based <ORGANIZATION>LIT Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, the largest financer of traders in the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> options and futures markets, said yesterday it will incur a second-half loss as a result of the market plunge.
<PERSON>Christopher Castleman</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>LIT</ORGANIZATION> chief executive, said in an interview that the loss stemmed from the default of three options traders who had bet on a price rise in <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION> shares before Oct. 13.
<ORGANIZATION>LIT Holdings</ORGANIZATION> shares plummeted 36 pence to close at 54 pence (85 cents), a 40% drop, on <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s stock exchange. 
<PERSON>Denizens</PERSON> of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s financial district are cushioning themselves for heavy blows. "A lot more of our customers are staying until our 10 p.m. closing time," says <PERSON>Christopher Brown</PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION>Corney & Barrow Restaurants Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, which runs five tony wine bars in the district. 
"There's a strong sense among the martini set that there's more {bad news} to come," asserts <PERSON>Roger Yates</PERSON>, chief investment officer at <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Grenfell Asset Management</ORGANIZATION>. "People in the stock market were very much <PERSON>Thatcher</PERSON>'s children -- very young and wealthy optimists.
The malaise has created a nostalgic longing for the uncomplicated days of the mid-1980s, before a rash of securities-firm mergers on the eve of the industry's deregulation in 1986. "People come to us saying they'd like to be back where they were a few years ago, in a more collegial atmosphere, with less tension," says <PERSON>Stephen Waterhouse</PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION>Hanover Partners Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a financial district head-hunting firm. 
The industry, which currently employs about 25,000 people in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, has shed about 2,500 jobs over the past two years. "I can see cuts of at least 20% more," says the head of the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> office of a major <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> firm. 
"If prices in the States go down, industrial buyers in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> have the opportunity of getting reasonable prices in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>," says <PERSON>Francois von Hurter</PERSON>, chief of <ORGANIZATION>Continential M&A</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd</ORGANIZATION>.
Says <PERSON>Allen D. Wheat</PERSON>, head of trading at <ORGANIZATION>Bankers Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION>: "People are just plain scared." 
One person who is past worrying about <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s blues is <PERSON>Christopher Hartley</PERSON>.
He didn't stop until he got to <PERSON>Jackson Hole</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Wyo</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s largest department store operator said the rights offering will entitle holders of its ordinary shares, except residents in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, to subscribe for two additional shares for every five shares held at a price of C$31.25 a share.
On the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Hudson</ORGANIZATION>'s Bay shares closed at C$35, up 12.5 cents. 
<LOCATION>Hudson</LOCATION>'s Bay said that <ORGANIZATION>Woodbridge Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which currently holds about 77% of the ordinary shares, will subscribe for all the shares to which it is entitled and for any shares that aren't otherwise taken up.
<LOCATION>Woodbridge</LOCATION> is a holding company owned by <ORGANIZATION>Toronto</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Thomson</PERSON> family. 
The arrests capped a four-month investigation by the <ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Attorney's office and a <ORGANIZATION>Security Pacific</ORGANIZATION> internal investigation team.
<PERSON>Walter S. Fisher</PERSON>, executive vice president and general auditor of the bank's parent, <ORGANIZATION>Security Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said no bank funds were at risk during the investigation. 
Arrested were <PERSON>Jose O. Lopez</PERSON>, 27 years old, of <LOCATION>Whittier</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, the vault supervisor; <PERSON>Carlos O. Huerta</PERSON>, 29, of <ORGANIZATION>La Puente</ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON>Luis A. Arroyo</PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Ignacio Rojas Jr.</PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION>Baldwin Park</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Doris Moreno</PERSON>, 37, of <ORGANIZATION>Bell Gardens</ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON>Ana L. Azucena</PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION>Huntington Park</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Geno M. Apicella</PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Terrell N. Madison</PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION>Hawthorne</LOCATION>, were also charged with participating in the conspiracy. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> said it is seeking to join a private lawsuit challenging a <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> suburb's zoning ordinance that sharply restricts the locations available to group homes for the handicapped. 
In papers filed with the federal district court in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> alleged that the ordinance, by limiting the number of group homes that can be established in the township, makes housing unavailable on account of handicap.
<PERSON>Greg Smith</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Moon Township</ORGANIZATION> manager, said the ordinance is intended to prevent the concentration of group homes for the mentally retarded from changing "the character and flavor of the neighborhood." He said the ordinance also will benefit the mentally retarded. "Our intent is to spread them out" to insure they are well integrated into the community, he said. 
<PERSON>Albert Engelken</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert Thomson</PERSON> had never met, though for 38 years their lives had been intertwined in a way peculiar to the sports world.
<PERSON>Mr. Engelken</PERSON>, now a transit-association executive in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Mr. Thomson</PERSON>, a paper-products salesman in <LOCATION>Montvale</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, hadn't even talked to each other.
<PERSON>Mr. Engelken</PERSON>, a rabid baseball fan, pores over the sports pages to chart the exploits of "my favorite and not-so-favorite teams and players." He often groans, he says, at the "clutter" of sports stories about drugs, alcohol, gambling and some player's lament "about the miserly millions he is offered to play the game." His morning paper, the <ORGANIZATION>Washington Post</ORGANIZATION>, even carries a sports column called "Jurisprudence" that recounts the latest arrests and convictions of players and team managers.
But his is a story about a hero in an era of sports anti-heroes, and about what <PERSON>Babe Ruth</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Engelken</PERSON> reminds us, once called "the only real game in the world." To <PERSON>Mr. Engelken</PERSON>, it is also a story "about love, because I'm blessed to have a wife who still thinks her slightly eccentric husband's 50th birthday deserves the ultimate present." 
To understand what <PERSON>Mr. Engelken</PERSON> means, one must go back to a sunny October afternoon in 1951 at <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Polo Grounds</LOCATION> stadium, where, it can be argued, the most dramatic moment in baseball history was played out. 
It was the ninth inning of the third game of a three-game playoff between the <ORGANIZATION>Brooklyn Dodgers</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>New York Giants</ORGANIZATION> (the predecessor to the <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco Giants</ORGANIZATION> scheduled to play in tonight's world series).
<PERSON>Mr. Engelken</PERSON> was doing the same across the <LOCATION>Hudson River</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, where, with his nose pressed against the front window of the <ORGANIZATION>Passaic-Clifton National Bank</ORGANIZATION>, he watched the duel on a television set the bank set up for the event. 
The playoff series had riveted the 12-year-old Giants fan. "The <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> struck first, winning the opener, 3-1, on a two-run homer off Dodger right-hander <PERSON>Ralph Branca</PERSON>," <PERSON>Mr. Engelken</PERSON> recalls with precision today. "The <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> got swamped in the second game, 100, and trailed 4-1 going into the bottom of the ninth of the third and deciding game.
The <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> scored once and had runners on second {<PERSON>Whitey Lockman</PERSON>} and third {<PERSON>Clint Hartung</PERSON>} as <PERSON>Bobby Thomson</PERSON> advanced to the plate." 
<PERSON>Mr. Thomson</PERSON>, a tall, Scottish-born, right-hand hitter, stepped into the batter's box. "<PERSON>Thomson</PERSON> took a called strike," <PERSON>Mr. Engelken</PERSON> recounts.
The pitch sailed toward <PERSON>Bobby Thomson</PERSON> high and inside and then, with a crack of the bat, was sent rocketing back into the lower leftfield stands. "<ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> fans went into euphoria," says <PERSON>Mr. Engelken</PERSON>. 
There can't be an older baseball fan alive who doesn't clearly remember that <PERSON>Bobby Thomson</PERSON> homer, who can't tell you where he was when he heard the famous <ORGANIZATION>Russ Hodges</ORGANIZATION> radio broadcast -- the one that concluded with <PERSON>Mr. Hodges</PERSON> shouting, over and over, "The <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> win the pennant, the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> win the pennant!" 
<PERSON>Mr. Engelken</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Thomson</PERSON> drifted in different directions in the subsequent years, and the <LOCATION>Polo Grounds</LOCATION>, located under <ORGANIZATION>Coogan</ORGANIZATION>'s Bluff in upper <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, was replaced by a public-housing project.
<PERSON>Mr. Engelken</PERSON> moved south to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, but he took with him enduring memories of the homer of 1951.
When his wife, <PERSON>Betsy</PERSON>, came down the aisle on their wedding day in 1966, <PERSON>Mr. Engelken</PERSON> -- no slouch on the romantic front -- gave her the ultimate compliment: "You look prettier than <PERSON>Bobby Thomson</PERSON>'s home run." The couple's first dog, Homer, was named after the Great Event, though unwitting friends assumed he was the namesake of the poet. 
And when <PERSON>Mr. Engelken</PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON>Martha</PERSON>, who was born two days before the home run, reached her 25th birthday, <PERSON>Mr. Engelken</PERSON> wrote his sports hero to tell him of the coincidence of events.
<PERSON>Mr. Thomson</PERSON> sent off a card to <LOCATION>Martha</LOCATION>: "It doesn't seem like 25 years since I hit that home run to celebrate your birth," it read.
<PERSON>Martha</PERSON> was pleased, but nowhere near as much as <PERSON>Mr. Engelken</PERSON>. 
And on <PERSON>Mr. Engelken</PERSON>'s 40th birthday, his wife bought a book detailing the big homer and sent it off to <PERSON>Mr. Thomson</PERSON> to be autographed. "What could have been better?" asks <PERSON>Mr. Engelken</PERSON>. 
On her husband's 50th birthday (after an auspicious 23 years of marriage, it should be noted), <LOCATION>Betsy</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Al</PERSON> and their college-bound son set out for <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to visit <ORGANIZATION>Fordham University</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mrs. Engelken</PERSON> had scheduled a stop on the <LOCATION>New Jersey Turnpike</LOCATION> to, she told her husband, pick up some papers for a neighbor.
"It sounded like something out of <PERSON>Ian Fleming</PERSON>," <PERSON>Mr. Engelken</PERSON> recalls. 
Keep your <PERSON>Thomas Jeffersons</PERSON>, or St. Augustines or <LOCATION>Michelangelos</LOCATION>; I'd take baseball's Flying Scot without hesitation." 
His hero signed photographs of the homer and diplomatically called <PERSON>Ralph Branca</PERSON> "a very fine pitcher." And when <PERSON>Mr. Engelken</PERSON> asked him why he took time off from work for somebody he didn't even know, <PERSON>Bobby Thomson</PERSON> replied: "You know, <PERSON>Albert</PERSON>, if you have the chance in life to make somebody this happy, you have an obligation to do it." 
But when <PERSON>Betsy Engelken</PERSON> wrote him, saying she could stop near his <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> home, it seemed different. "What a good feeling it would be for me to do that," he says he thought. 
When the <PERSON>Engelken</PERSON> family got back from its trip up north, <PERSON>Mr. Engelken</PERSON> wrote it all down, just to make sure no detail was missed. "On the way home," his notes recall, "it took concentrated effort to keep that car pointed south.

Police say the robberies are usually pulled off by two to five men, who walk into the agencies near closing or lunch time, when few employees are there. "They looked like ordinary vacationers at first," says <PERSON>Willy LLerena</PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION>Travel Air Service</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Monte Bello</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, describing five men who entered his agency last June. 
At <ORGANIZATION>El Monte Travel Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>El Monte</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, customers now can get in only through a buzzer and lock system. "It's hard to deal with clients this way in a service business," says <PERSON>Ralph</PERSON> "Bud" <PERSON>Conner</PERSON>, owner of the agency, which was robbed of 180 blank tickets and $850 last month. "But we're just too nervous." 
Now, they're charging as little $3 a day. "If they're telling the truth now, then they've been charging 300% more than what is reasonable," says <PERSON>Steve Gardner</PERSON>, an assistant state attorney general in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. 
A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Hertz Corp.</ORGANIZATION> acknowledges, "The waiver isn't a source of protection for consumers, but a source of revenue." But <PERSON>Hertz</PERSON> points out that at least it's now charging only $3.95 a day in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, while some competitors are charging $6.99.
"As far as the <ORGANIZATION>FAA</ORGANIZATION> is concerned," says <PERSON>Matt Finucane</PERSON>, air safety director at the <ORGANIZATION>Association of Flight Attendants</ORGANIZATION>, "flight attendants can work an unlimited number of hours." 
For instance, tired flight attendants might not react quickly enough during an emergency evacuation. "At the end of their day, they are zombies," says <PERSON>John Galipault</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Aviation Safety Institute</ORGANIZATION>, a public-interest group in <LOCATION>Worthington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>. "They have to work such long hours and then we expect them to be heroes if there's an evacuation." In response to the study, the <ORGANIZATION>FAA</ORGANIZATION> says it is considering changing its policy -- or lack of it -- on flight attendants.

<ORGANIZATION>Furukawa Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s leading electric wire and cable manufacturers, said unconsolidated pretax profit in the fiscal first half ended Sept. 30 fell 5.3% to 6.11 billion yen ($43.1 million) from 6.45 billion yen a year earlier. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Futures Commission</ORGANIZATION>, a government watchdog set up after the 1987 crash to try to restore confidence and order to <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s markets, had been expected to give the contract conditional approval last week.
It is almost a carbon copy of the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION>'s Eurodollar contract, which is based on the three-month Eurodollar rate, the rate paid on U.S.-dollar deposits in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> banks. 
If the contract is as successful as some expect, it may do much to restore confidence in futures trading in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>. "The contract is definitely important to the exchange," says <PERSON>Robert Gilmore</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Futures Commission</ORGANIZATION>. 
While <LOCATION>Asian</LOCATION> markets struggled to cope with the uncertainty caused by the Oct. 13 plunge in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> stock prices, futures trading in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> was relatively heavy and went smoothly.
That was also the case in the days following the June 4 massacre in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>, which caused a sharp drop in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> stock prices. 
Most important to the contract's success is the commitment of <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s big financial institutions, especially the two leaders, <ORGANIZATION>Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and the local subsidiary of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Standard Chartered Bank PLC</ORGANIZATION>.
"If those two banks are there, then the balance of the banking institutions will be there," says <PERSON>Mr. Gilmore</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Futures Commission</ORGANIZATION> official. 
Even though the currency is pegged to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollar, with a fixed exchange rate of HK$7.8 to the American currency, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> economies don't always move in lock step, making it difficult to predict where interest rates in the colony will go. 
The Hibor contract "solves quite a bit of the problem of interest-rate risk in the interbank market," says <PERSON>Eric Cheng</PERSON>, a director of <PERSON>James Capel</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>) <LOCATION>Ltd.</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> arm of the British brokerage firm. 
And <PERSON>Mr. Gilmore</PERSON> cautions that there may be limits on how much the contract can grow because the <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> dollar isn't a widely traded currency.
"You're not going to get your taxi drivers and amahs and all that," says <PERSON>Rory Nicholas</PERSON>, a director for securities company <ORGANIZATION>Elders Bullion & Futures Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 
On an office wall of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> intelligence committee hangs a quote from Chairman <PERSON>David Boren</PERSON>, "Don't hold your ticket 'til the show's over." He once used that line in a closed-door meeting on <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, meaning don't shrink from taking action against <PERSON>Manuel Noriega</PERSON>. 
So how did a good senator like this end up approving a policy that required the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> to warn <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> of any coup plot against him? "I agree, it's ridiculous," says <PERSON>Mr. Boren</PERSON>, and indeed by now ridiculous may be the only way to describe how the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> decides to take -- or rather, not to take -- covert action. 
<PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> disclosed the policy last week by reading it to <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> senators, perhaps as a way of shifting blame for the <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> fiasco to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
The policy was contained in an exchange of letters last October between the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> intelligence committee and the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>National Security Council</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Boren</PERSON> himself didn't discover the warn-your-enemy nuance until <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> told him privately at the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> last week. 
He's the senator most like <PERSON>Arthur Vandenberg</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> senator from <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> who worked to forge a bipartisan foreign policy in the 1940s. "<PERSON>Vandenberg</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rayburn</PERSON> are heroes of mine," <PERSON>Mr. Boren</PERSON> says, referring as well to <PERSON>Sam Rayburn</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic House</ORGANIZATION> speaker who cooperated with President <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON>. "They allowed this country to be credible.
Last July, his committee rejected a <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration plan to support a coup in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Democrat Howard Metzenbaum</ORGANIZATION> refused to support any plan that might get people hurt, a charming notion for a great power.
<LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> Republican <PERSON>William Cohen</PERSON> said the plan might violate the assassination ban.
<PERSON>Mr. Boren</PERSON> doesn't think all this influenced the failed coup this month, but he does concede that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> has made mistakes. "In the aftermath of <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, in the aftermath of <LOCATION>Iran-Contra</LOCATION>, I can understand some people might think that if they plan a coup, they have to bring their lawyers," he says. 
<PERSON>Elliott Abrams</PERSON>, a veteran of intelligence committee debates, doubts that even <LOCATION>Grenada</LOCATION> or the <LOCATION>Libyan</LOCATION> raid would have taken place if "consensus" had been required.
<ORGANIZATION>Vandenberg</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Rayburn</PERSON> were wise enough to leave specific operations to presidents; modern senators, <PERSON>Mr. Boren</PERSON> notwithstanding, are less modest. 
The result is that the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> committee has what amounts to veto power over every covert action. "I wouldn't say it's quite a veto," <PERSON>Mr. Boren</PERSON> demurs.
He points to a letter on his desk, his second in a week from President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, saying that they "don't disagree." More broadly, <PERSON>Mr. Boren</PERSON> hopes that <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> will shock <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> out of its fear of using military power. "Maybe this will jolt us out of the post-Vietnam syndrome that we never are prepared to use force," he says. 
The reply of the <ORGANIZATION>Metzenbaums</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Cohens</ORGANIZATION> is that we can't abolish these oversight committees because we've seen too many abuses of executive power.
In <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> interests at stake were happily minor; the only people killed were foreigners hapless enough to trust <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> will.
<ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> wants to buy as much as 15% of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar PLC</ORGANIZATION>, marking its first salvo in a possible full-scale battle against <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> for control of the British car maker. 
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> sought <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> antitrust clearance last week to purchase more than $15 million worth of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shares but doesn't own any yet, according to <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> officials here and at the company's <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> headquarters.
The No. 1 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auto maker then wrote <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> that it intends "to go to that 15%" level once it wins the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> clearance to go beyond $15 million, a <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said yesterday. 
The <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> move follows Tuesday's declaration by <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>, which holds an unwelcome 12.45% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, that it is prepared to bid for the entire company.
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> is close to completing a friendly deal with <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> that is likely to involve an eventual 30% stake and joint manufacturing ventures.
Speculative investors, betting on an imminent clash between <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>, pushed up <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s share price five pence (eight <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> cents) to a near-record 720 pence ($11.60) in late trading on <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s stock exchange yesterday.
But an all-out bidding war between the world's top auto giants for <ORGANIZATION>Britain</ORGANIZATION>'s leading luxury-car maker seems unlikely. "We will not go over a certain level," said <PERSON>David N. McCammon</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for finance, at a news conference yesterday in <LOCATION>Dearborn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION> "There's some price at which we'd stop bidding." He wouldn't specify what it was. 
"I really don't see the government doing something that <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> doesn't want over the next 14 months," said <PERSON>Kenneth Warren</PERSON>, a Conservative member of <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Select Committee on Trade and Industry</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>House of Commons</ORGANIZATION>. "The golden share is a single share, but it is the magic share." 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> is willing to bid for 100% of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s shares if both the government and <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shareholders agree to relax the anti-takeover barrier prematurely.
As <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s biggest holder and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s biggest car maker, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> could turn up the heat by convening a special shareholders' meeting and urging holders to drop the limits early.
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> might succeed because many shareholders are speculators keen for a full bid or institutional investors unhappy over <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> management's handling of its current financial difficulties. 
It has relinquished a golden share only once before -- during <ORGANIZATION>British Petroleum Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's #2.5 billion ($4 billion) takeover of <ORGANIZATION>Britoil PLC</ORGANIZATION> in 1988. 
In wooing <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> lawmakers, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> has pointed out that its willingness to settle for a minority stake would keep <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> British-owned and independent.
This week, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auto giant paid for 10 <ORGANIZATION>House of Commons</ORGANIZATION> members and two <ORGANIZATION>House of Lords</ORGANIZATION> members to fly to <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> and tour its operations there.
While the visit was unrelated to <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Roger Smith</PERSON> answered the legislators' questions about it over lunch Tuesday.
The Conservatives don't dare jeopardize marginal Tory seats in <LOCATION>Coventry</LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> has headquarters, nor can the government easily back down on promised protection for a privatized company while it proceeds with controversial plans to privatize most of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s water and electricity industries. 
Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON> might, however, be receptive to any request by <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> Chairman Sir <PERSON>John Egan</PERSON> for the restriction's early removal to let <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> amass more than 15% or mount a friendly suitor bid against <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>.
In the end, Sir <PERSON>John</PERSON> -- rather than the government or <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shareholders -- may hold the key that unlocks the golden share. 
<ORGANIZATION>W.R. Grace & Co.</ORGANIZATION> said it formed a new horticultural-products company by combining its soil-nutrients and fertilizers business with <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Chemical Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Milpitas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. 
In the wake of the <ORGANIZATION>Exxon Valdez</ORGANIZATION> spill in March, new governmental drilling bans are sharply curtailing exploration in promising locations offshore and in <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>. 
Recently <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>, traditional heavy-crude producers, have boasted of new finds of light, low-sulfur oil by their national oil companies.
Typical is <PERSON>Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s state-owned energy company, which not long ago acquired through its <ORGANIZATION>AGIP</ORGANIZATION> oil subsidiary a 5% share in the consortium accounting for half of <LOCATION>Nigeria</LOCATION>'s oil output.
<ORGANIZATION>AGIP</ORGANIZATION> already has an oil stake in <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Franco Reviglio</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>ENI</ORGANIZATION> chairman, looks for sweeping structural change in the oil industry -- he calls it a "revolution" requiring huge investments -- as a result of environmental issues.
He made a special trip to examine <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> environmental trends because they are often followed in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
Oil companies world-wide will have "to spend a lot of money for the cleaner fuels that will be required," says <PERSON>John H. Lichtblau</PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION>Petroleum Industry Research Foundation</ORGANIZATION>.
<LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</ORGANIZATION> alone is thought to hide more than three billion barrels of oil.
Similarly, a group of companies led by <ORGANIZATION>Chevron Corp.</ORGANIZATION> has been unable to pump oil found off the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> coast in the early 1980s.
Activity has revived in the largest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> gas-producing regions, such as the Gulf of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe International Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which is owned by <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> (and isn't related to <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s unit), is stepping up development of a well off <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>' <LOCATION>Matagorda Island</LOCATION> where it found gas in 1987. "We could have sat on it longer, but the impetus is to get the gas to the marketplace," says <PERSON>Richard Poole</PERSON>, senior scout for <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe International</ORGANIZATION>. "We're trying to get it on line as soon as possible now." 
This month, <ORGANIZATION>Exxon Corp.</ORGANIZATION> announced plans for a 400-day project drilling for gas about five miles underground in the <LOCATION>Anadarko Basin</LOCATION> of western <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> -- the deepest drilling project in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Exxon</ORGANIZATION> will use a <ORGANIZATION>Parker Drilling Co.</ORGANIZATION> rig built in 1981 that can go down 9 1/2 miles. 
Although it was published unsigned in the latest edition of the weekly <ORGANIZATION>Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta</ORGANIZATION>, Soviet sources say the article was written by <PERSON>Leonid Abalkin</PERSON> and a small group of colleagues.
<PERSON>Mr. Abalkin</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Academy of Science's Institute of Economics</ORGANIZATION>, was recently appointed deputy chairman of the Soviet government and head of a state commission on economic reform. 
The blueprint is at its vaguest when referring to the fate of the two powerful economic institutions that seem likely to oppose such sweeping plans: the <ORGANIZATION>State Planning Committee</ORGANIZATION>, known as <PERSON>Gosplan</PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION>State Committee for Material Supply</ORGANIZATION>, or <LOCATION>Gossnab</LOCATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Federal Communications Commission</ORGANIZATION> allowed <ORGANIZATION>American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ORGANIZATION> to continue offering discount phone services for large-business customers and said it would soon re-examine its regulation of the long-distance market. 
The <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION> moves were good news for <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION>, which has been striving since the breakup of the phone system for greater latitude in pricing and reduced regulation.
<PERSON>Alfred Sikes</PERSON>, the new <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION> chairman, championed deregulation of <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> at his last job as head of a <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> telecommunications agency.
But it has been an open question whether <PERSON>Mr. Sikes</PERSON>, an extraordinarily cautious man, would continue pushing deregulation at the <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION> in the face of what is likely to be great political pressure. 
"It means that <PERSON>Sikes</PERSON> is serious about the deregulation of long distance," said <PERSON>Jack Grubman</PERSON>, a telecommunications analyst at <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, who attended the <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION> meeting. "All the commissioners were in amazing agreement {to re-examine regulation} for only having been together for a few months." 
The <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION> took three specific actions regarding <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION>.
By a 4-0 vote, it allowed <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> to continue offering special discount packages to big customers, called Tariff 12, rejecting appeals by <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> competitors that the discounts were illegal.
Then by a separate 4-0 vote, it chose the narrowest possible grounds to strike down a different discount plan, called Tariff 15, that <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> offered to <ORGANIZATION>Holiday Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> gave a 5% to 10% discount to the <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, company that oversees Holiday Inns, in response to a similar discount offered to <ORGANIZATION>Holiday Corp.</ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION>MCI Communications Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
The agency said that because <ORGANIZATION>MCI</ORGANIZATION>'s offer had expired <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> couldn't continue to offer its discount plan.
Indeed, <PERSON>Joe Nacchio</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for business-communications services, said <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> offered a similar Tariff 15 discount to Resort Condominium International, of <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION>, to meet another <ORGANIZATION>MCI</ORGANIZATION> bid.
Apart from those two actions, <PERSON>Mr. Sikes</PERSON> and the three other commissioners said they expect to re-examine how <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> is regulated since competition has increased.
<PERSON>Richard Firestone</PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION>'s common-carrier bureau, said he expected the agency to propose new rules next year. 
<ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> applauded the <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION>'s actions. "The time is long overdue to take a look at the fierce competition in the long-distance business and the rules governing it," the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> telecommunications firm said in a statement.
But <ORGANIZATION>MCI</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, was displeased with the <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION> decision concerning Tariff 12, arguing that "<ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> cannot be allowed to flaunt <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION> rules." 
<ORGANIZATION>United Telecommunications Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>US Sprint</ORGANIZATION> unit said it was "obviously disappointed" with the <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION> decision on Tariff 12.
<ORGANIZATION>US Sprint</ORGANIZATION> said was it will petition the <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION> decision in federal court. "We believe that the court will find it unlawful," said a <ORGANIZATION>US Sprint</ORGANIZATION> spokesman. 
Separately, <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> filed a countersuit against <ORGANIZATION>MCI</ORGANIZATION> accusing it of misleading consumers through allegedly "false and deceptive" advertising.
Earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION>MCI</ORGANIZATION> sued <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> in federal district court, claiming that <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION>'s ads are false. 
<ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> assembled three of its top executives in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, all visibly angry, to try to refute <ORGANIZATION>MCI</ORGANIZATION>'s charges. "<ORGANIZATION>MCI</ORGANIZATION> has made hawks out of the upper echelon of <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION>," said <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Grubman</PERSON>, who said he expected <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> to become increasingly aggressive in dealing with its longtime nemesis.

Last week alone, an eye-popping $1.6 billion flowed out of the junk funds, or nearly 5% of their total assets, according to estimates by <ORGANIZATION>Dalbar Financial Services Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> research firm. 
Interviews with three major fund groups -- <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Investments</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Vanguard Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>T. Rowe Price Associates Inc.</ORGANIZATION> -- confirm the trend.
Some fund managers say negative publicity has exacerbated investors' concern about recent declines in junk-bond prices. "People have been seeing headline after headline after headline and saying: `I can't take it anymore -- I'm getting out, '" says <PERSON>Kurt Brouwer</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Brouwer & Janachowski</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> investment adviser. 
Mutual fund groups haven't lost control of much of the outgoing money, says <PERSON>Louis Harvey</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dalbar</PERSON>'s president.
About 98% of the outflow was transferred to other <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity</ORGANIZATION> funds, says <PERSON>Neal Litvack</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity</ORGANIZATION> vice president, marketing, with most going into money market funds. 
<ORGANIZATION>Vanguard</ORGANIZATION>'s $1 billion <ORGANIZATION>High Yield Bond Portfolio</ORGANIZATION> has seen $161 million flow out since early September; $14 million of that seeped out Friday Oct. 13 alone.
Still, two-thirds of the outflow has been steered into other <ORGANIZATION>Vanguard</ORGANIZATION> portfolios, says <PERSON>Brian Mattes</PERSON>, a vice president.
Those withdrawals, most of which were transferred to other <ORGANIZATION>T. Rowe Price</ORGANIZATION> funds, followed little change in the fund's sales picture this year through August. "The last two months have been the whole ball game," says <PERSON>Steven Norwitz</PERSON>, a vice president. 
Through Oct. 19, high-yield funds had an average 0.85% total return (the price change plus dividends on fund shares), according to <ORGANIZATION>Lipper Analytical Services Inc</ORGANIZATION>. That's even less than the 4.35% total return of the <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION> High-Yield Index. 
<ORGANIZATION>Fidelity</ORGANIZATION>'s junk fund has fallen 2.08% this year through Oct. 19, <PERSON>Lipper</PERSON> says; the <ORGANIZATION>Vanguard</ORGANIZATION> fund rose 1.84%; and the <ORGANIZATION>T. Rowe Price</ORGANIZATION> fund edged up 0.66%. 
Says <PERSON>Michael Hirsch</PERSON>, chief investment officer of <ORGANIZATION>Republic National Bank</ORGANIZATION> and manager of the <ORGANIZATION>FundTrust Group</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>: "It's a time bomb just waiting to go off." 
<PERSON>Peter W. Likins</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Lehigh University</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Bethlehem</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, was elected a director of this maker of industrial motion-control parts and systems.
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Trinova</ORGANIZATION> closed at $32.125, up 12.5 cents. 
The split was aimed at boosting the stock's liquidity, said <PERSON>Brendan Barba</PERSON>, chairman of the <LOCATION>Moonachie</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, maker of plastic film products.
<ORGANIZATION>Intel Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's most powerful computer chip has flaws that could delay several computer makers' marketing efforts, but the "bugs" aren't expected to hurt <ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION> and most computer makers. 
But while <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Compaq Computer Corp.</ORGANIZATION> say the bugs will delay products, most big computer makers said the flaws don't affect them. "Bugs like this are just a normal part of product development," said <PERSON>Richard Archuleta</PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's advanced systems development.
Likewise, <ORGANIZATION>AST Research Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sun Microsystems Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said the bugs won't delay their development of 486-based machines. "We haven't modified our schedules in any way," said a Sun spokesman.
Nonetheless, concern about the chip may have been responsible for a decline of 87.5 cents in <ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION>'s stock to $32 a share yesterday in over-the-counter trading, on volume of 3,609,800 shares, and partly responsible for a drop in <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION>'s stock in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading on Wednesday.
<ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION> said it had corrected the problems and would start producing bugless chips next week. "We should not be seeing any more," said <PERSON>Bill Rash</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION>'s director for the 486 chip. 
Sun, <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard</ORGANIZATION> and others say <ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION> isn't wholly to blame for the snafu.
The real culprits, they said, are computer makers such as <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> that have jumped the gun to unveil 486-based products. "The reason this is getting so much visibility is that some started shipping and announced early availability," said <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Archuleta</PERSON>. "You can do that but you're taking a risk.
<ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION>'s 80486 chip is the <ORGANIZATION>Corvette of Intel</ORGANIZATION>'s microprocessors, a super-fast, super-expensive chip that only the most power-hungry computer users are likely to buy for at least several years. 
The 486 is the descendant of a long series of <ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION> chips that began dominating the market ever since <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> picked the 16-bit 8088 chip for its first personal computer. (A 16-bit microprocessor processes 16 pieces of data at a time and is slower than newer, 32-bit chips.) Since then, <ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION> has cornered a large part of the market with successive generations of 16-bit and 32-bit chips, all of which can run software written for previous models. 
Of the big computer makers, only <ORGANIZATION>Apple Computer Co.</ORGANIZATION> bases its machines on <ORGANIZATION>Motorola</ORGANIZATION> chips instead. "The 486 is going to have a big impact on the industry," said <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Archuleta</PERSON>. "It's going to be the leading edge technology in personal computers for the next few years.

On the hungry streets of <PERSON>Naguib Mahfouz</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>, life is nasty, brutish and wickedly entertaining. 
<PERSON>Hassan Kamel Ali</PERSON> is a card shark and dope dealer who has a simple creed: "I live in this world, assuming that there is no morality, God or police." For the killer and thief, <PERSON>Said Mahran</PERSON>, fame flows from the barrel of a gun. "One man said you act as a stimulant," a prostitute tells him, "a diversion to relieve people's boredom." 
<PERSON>Mr. Mahfouz</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> also has Sufi sheiks and saintly wives who look to God, not crime, for their salvation.
Published in 1949, it follows the decline of a <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> family with the saga-like sweep and rich detail that critics often compare to <LOCATION>Dickens</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Balzac</LOCATION> and Galsworthy. 
But its unsentimental sketches of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> life are vintage <PERSON>Mahfouz</PERSON>.
We see, smell and hear slums filled with "the echoes of hawkers advertising their wares interspersed with abusive language, rattling coughs and the sound of people gathering spittle in their throats and spewing into the street." And we meet engaging crooks, such as <PERSON>Hassan</PERSON> "the Head," famed for his head-butting fights, his whoring and his hashish. "`God has not yet ordained that I should have earnings, ' he tells his worried mother." <PERSON>Hassan</PERSON> comes to a bad end, but so does almost everyone else in the book. 
If the setting is exotic, the prose is closer to <ORGANIZATION>Balzac</ORGANIZATION>'s "Pere Goriot" than it is to "Arabian Nights." <PERSON>Mr. Mahfouz</PERSON> began writing when there was no novelistic tradition in Arabic, and he modeled his work on Western classics.
In one sense, this limits him; unlike a writer such as <PERSON>Gabriel Garcia Marquez</PERSON>, who has a distinctive Latin voice, <PERSON>Mr. Mahfouz</PERSON>'s style offers little that can be labeled "Egyptian." But the familiarity of his style also makes his work accessible, as the streets of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> come alive for the Western reader as vividly as <PERSON>Dickens</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> or <PERSON>Dostoevski</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>St. Petersburg</LOCATION>. 
"The Thief and the Dogs," written in 1961, is a taut, psychological drama, reminiscent of "Crime and Punishment." Its antihero, <PERSON>Said Mahran</PERSON>, is an <PERSON>Egyptian Raskolnikov</PERSON> who seeks nobility in robbing and killing. "I am the hope and the dream, the redemption of cowards," he says in one of many interior monologues.
<PERSON>Mr. Mahfouz</PERSON> has been pilloried and censored for questioning <ORGANIZATION>Islam</ORGANIZATION> and advocating peace with <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>.

The panel found that since 1987, real-estate prices rose nearly 50% in a speculative fever fueled by economic prosperity, the 1988 <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> Olympics and the government's pledge to rapidly develop <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>'s southwest.
Meanwhile, the government's <ORGANIZATION>Land Bureau</ORGANIZATION> reports that only about a third of <LOCATION>Korean</LOCATION> families own their own homes. 
In fact, during the past three months there have been several demonstrations at the office complex where the <ORGANIZATION>Land Bureau</ORGANIZATION> is housed, and at the <ORGANIZATION>National Assembly</ORGANIZATION>, demanding the government put a stop to real-estate speculation. 
Government officials who are urging real-estate reforms balk at the arguments of business leaders and chafe at their pressure. "There is no violation of the capitalistic principle of private property in what we are doing," says <PERSON>Lee Kyu Hwang</PERSON>, director of the government's <ORGANIZATION>Land Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, which drafted the bills.
The land available for housing construction stands at about 46.2 square meters a person -- 18% lower than in <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> and only about half that of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Lee</PERSON> estimates that about 10,000 property speculators are operating in <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>.
The government's <ORGANIZATION>Office of Bank Supervision and Examination</ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION>National Assembly</ORGANIZATION> this month that in the first half of 1989, the nation's 30 largest business groups bought real estate valued at $1.5 billion. 
Security said it signed a letter of intent to purchase <ORGANIZATION>La Jolla Bancorp</ORGANIZATION>, agreeing to pay $15 of its own stock for each share of <ORGANIZATION>La Jolla</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>La Jolla</ORGANIZATION> is the parent company of <ORGANIZATION>La Jolla Bank & Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which has 12 branches in <LOCATION>San Diego County</LOCATION>.
Earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION>Security Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, which is among the 10 largest bank holding companies in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, completed the acquisition of San Diego-based <ORGANIZATION>Southwest Bancorp</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>SKF</ORGANIZATION> said demand for the group's main product, rolling bearings, remained favorable in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, which accounts for slightly more than two-thirds of group sales.
<ORGANIZATION>Exxon Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it will move its headquarters from <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Mobil Corp.</ORGANIZATION> is in the process of vacating its headquarters here, and huge operations like <ORGANIZATION>J.C. Penney & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Trans World Airlines</ORGANIZATION> have recently left. 
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> authorities, informed yesterday about the move, reacted with concern and even some anger to the idea of the nation's third-largest corporation leaving without giving them an opportunity to accommodate it. "We are dismayed, but there's nothing we can do about it now," said <PERSON>Stanley Grayson</PERSON>, <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> deputy mayor for finance and economic development. 
"When we were told it was <ORGANIZATION>Exxon</ORGANIZATION>, it was beyond all expectations; what a coup," said <PERSON>Tom Lewis</PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Dallas Partnership</ORGANIZATION>, the economic development affiliate of the city's <ORGANIZATION>Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Exxon</ORGANIZATION> said it will build a new headquarters on a 132-acre tract in the 10-year-old Las Colinas complex in the suburb of <LOCATION>Irving</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Las Colinas</LOCATION>, once a huge <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> ranch, is a sprawling complex of office buildings, homes and recreational facilities that its developers have been struggling to populate in recent years. 
Exxon officials said it will cost less to run its headquarters at <LOCATION>Las Colinas</LOCATION> than in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
Owners of the building in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> say they will be asking $50 per square foot for rent to fill the space that <ORGANIZATION>Exxon</ORGANIZATION> is vacating.
Plus, one <ORGANIZATION>Exxon</ORGANIZATION> official said, by eliminating the typically long <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> commutes between office and home, management will expect employees to work 40 hours a week in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, rather than a 35-hour work week in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
In 1987, the <ORGANIZATION>Presidents Commission</ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION>, which oversees most <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> intercollegiate sports, contracted with the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION>American Institutes for Research</ORGANIZATION> to do a survey on the college experiences of what the body chooses to call student-athletes.
The <ORGANIZATION>Knight Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>Akron</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, has established a national commission to look into college-sports reform, and the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA Presidents Commission</ORGANIZATION> earlier this month recommended cutting spring football practice in half, moving the start of basketball practice back by a month and reducing maximum schedules in that sport to 25 games from 28. 
The key word in that paragraph, though, is "may." <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> Executive Director <PERSON>Richard Schultz</PERSON>, in accepting a place on the <ORGANIZATION>Knight Commission</ORGANIZATION>, urged that the panel take a "balanced" view, which looks for all the world like a plea not to rock the boat too much, and the presidents' recommendations could face considerable opposition at the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION>'s full convention in January, which will vote on them.
<PERSON>Toni Johnson</PERSON> pulls a tape measure across the front of what was once a stately <PERSON>Victorian</PERSON> home. 
The petite, 29-year-old <PERSON>Ms. Johnson</PERSON>, dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt as she slogs through the steady afternoon rain, is a claims adjuster with <ORGANIZATION>Aetna Life & Casualty</ORGANIZATION>.
They don't flinch at writing them. "That's my job -- get {policyholders} what they're entitled to," says <PERSON>Bill Schaeffer</PERSON>, a claims supervisor who flew in from <LOCATION>Aetna</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Bridgeport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, office. 
The owners, <PERSON>William</PERSON> and <PERSON>Margie Hammack</PERSON>, are luckier than many others.
The <ORGANIZATION>Hammacks</ORGANIZATION>' own home, also in <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION>, suffered comparatively minor damage. 
<PERSON>Ms. Johnson</PERSON>, who works out of <LOCATION>Aetna</LOCATION>'s office in <LOCATION>Walnut Creek</LOCATION>, an East Bay suburb, is awed by the earthquake's destructive force. "It really brings you down to a human level," she says. "It's hard to accept all the suffering people are going through, but you have to.
For <ORGANIZATION>Aetna</ORGANIZATION> and other insurers, the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> earthquake hit when resources in the field already were stretched.
<ORGANIZATION>Aetna</ORGANIZATION>, which has nearly 3,000 adjusters, had deployed about 750 of them in <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>.
When the earthquake rocked northern <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> last week, <ORGANIZATION>Aetna</ORGANIZATION> senior claims executives from the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> area were at the company's <LOCATION>Hartford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, headquarters for additional training on how to handle major catastrophes, including earthquakes. 
Some adjusters, like <PERSON>Alan Singer</PERSON> of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, had been working in <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION> for nearly four weeks.
Offices were set up in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>. 
For example, officials at <LOCATION>Walnut Creek</LOCATION> office learned that the Amfac Hotel near the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> airport, which is insured by <LOCATION>Aetna</LOCATION>, was badly damaged when they saw it on network television news. 
"The secret to being a good adjuster is counting," says <PERSON>Gerardo Rodriguez</PERSON>, an <LOCATION>Aetna</LOCATION> adjuster from <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION>. "You have to count everything." 
When <ORGANIZATION>Aetna</ORGANIZATION> adjuster <PERSON>Bill Schaeffer</PERSON> visited a retired couple in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> last Thursday, he found them living in a mobile home parked in front of their yard. 
She spent a month at an <LOCATION>Aetna</LOCATION> school in <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, learning all about the construction trade, including masonry, plumbing and electrical wiring.
That was followed by three months at the <ORGANIZATION>Aetna Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Hartford</LOCATION>, where she was immersed in learning how to read and interpret policies. 
As <PERSON>Ms. Johnson</PERSON> stands outside the <LOCATION>Hammack</LOCATION> house after winding up her chores there, the house begins to creak and sway.
During her second meeting with the <LOCATION>Hammacks</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Ms. Johnson</PERSON> reviews exactly what their policy covers.
<PERSON>Mr. Hammack</PERSON> is eager to know what <LOCATION>Aetna</LOCATION> will pay for the house, which has to come down. "When will I get that check for a million dollars?" he jokes. 
It suddenly dawns on <PERSON>Mr. Hammack</PERSON> that rebuilding the house in <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION>, an affluent community in <LOCATION>Santa Clara County</LOCATION>, may cost more than <ORGANIZATION>Aetna</ORGANIZATION>'s policy will pay. "We can lose money on this," he says. 
Her sister, <LOCATION>Cynthia</LOCATION>, wishes <PERSON>Toni</PERSON> had a different job. "We worry about her out there," <PERSON>Cynthia</PERSON> says. 
Last Sunday, <PERSON>Ms. Johnson</PERSON> finally got a chance to water her plants, but stopped abruptly. "I realized I couldn't waste this water when there are people in <LOCATION>Watsonville</LOCATION> who don't have fresh water to drink." She hasn't played any music since the earthquake hit, out of respect for those who died on Interstate 880 where the roadway collapsed. 
The state-controlled French metals group <ORGANIZATION>Pechiney S.A.</ORGANIZATION> said it has signed a preliminary accord to sell its <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> headquarters to <ORGANIZATION>Groupement Foncier Francais</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Nouveaux Constructeurs</ORGANIZATION> for 2.76 billion francs ($443 million). 
Rep. <PERSON>Robert K. Dornan</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>) 
Ground zero of the <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> scandal is the Secretary's "discretionary fund," a honey pot used to fund projects that weren't approved through normal <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> channels.
After one of the most amazing debates we've ever seen on the cable channel C-SPAN, the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> voted 250 to 170 on Wednesday to order $28.4 million in spending for a <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> arts center, a <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> library and 38 other pet projects out of the same discretionary fund that was supposed to have been so abused during <PERSON>Sam Pierce</PERSON>'s tenure.
However, four are in the <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> district of Rep. <PERSON>Bob Traxler</PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that writes the <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> spending bill. 
Of course, this kind of blatant congressional pork-barreling is called "constituent service" by Members, while the same kind of noncompetitive favoritism at <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> is labeled "influence peddling." Unlike those awful Republican consultants, Members don't profit directly from <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> projects.
The 40 pet projects were discovered buried in the appropriations bill for <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> and some other agencies after it returned from a conference committee that was called to resolve differences between the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> versions.
-- $390,000 for a library and recreation center at <LOCATION>Mackinac Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Mideast</LOCATION> politics have calmed down and the squabbling within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries seems under control for now. "The fundamentals of supply and demand once again are setting oil prices," says <PERSON>Victor Burk</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>Arthur Andersen & Co.</ORGANIZATION> oil expert.
That in itself has got to cause people to feel a little more optimistic," says <PERSON>Glenn Cox</PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION>Phillips Petroleum Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
Corporate planners can plan again. "Management doesn't want surprises," notes <PERSON>Jack Zaves</PERSON>, who, as fuel-services director at <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, buys some 2.4 billion gallons of jet fuel a year.
And consumers "should be comfortable," adds <PERSON>W. Henson Moore</PERSON>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> deputy secretary of energy. "I don't see anything on the horizon that could lead to a precipitous rise in the price." 
About a year ago, it ended an on-again, off-again internal production war that had put prices on a roller coaster and pitched oil towns from <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Caracas</LOCATION> into recession.
<LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION>'s kingpin, abandoned a policy of flooding the market to punish quota-cheaters.
<ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General Subroto explains: Consumers offer security of markets, while <ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION> provides security of supply. "This is an opportune time to find mutual ways {to prevent} price shocks from happening again," he says. 
<PERSON>Patrick J. Early</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Amoco Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's oil-production unit, says that despite recent stability, he plans continued tightening of costs and exploration spending.
The view of some others in <ORGANIZATION>Big Oil</ORGANIZATION>, he maintains, "is very much {similar to} <ORGANIZATION>Amoco</ORGANIZATION>'s outlook." Just this week <ORGANIZATION>Mobil Corp.</ORGANIZATION> disclosed new cutbacks in its domestic exploration and production operations. 
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Energy Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Co.</ORGANIZATION>, bought from <ORGANIZATION>Amoco</ORGANIZATION> the rights that allowed it to drill the <PERSON>Sharpshooter</PERSON>.
It is more aggressive than most, but it isn't the only company with a new attitude, as it found when it went looking for a partner for the Sharpshooter. "We went to six companies over two days pitching the prospect," says <PERSON>Tim Parker</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> exploration manager. "Five were interested." 
<PERSON>Mitchell</PERSON> will get a half-interest in the oil. "A kind of no-mistakes mentality" had been stifling activity, says <PERSON>Don Covey</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mitchell</PERSON>'s oil exploration chief.
<ORGANIZATION>Kadane Oil Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a small <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> independent, is currently drilling two wells itself and putting money into three others.
Although "it's still difficult to raise money for a pure wildcat program," says <PERSON>William Thomas</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Texas Commerce Bank</ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, "institutions are starting to see there are cycles to these things, and this one is beginning to turn." 
Contractors such as <ORGANIZATION>Parker Drilling Co.</ORGANIZATION> are raising cash again through stock offerings, and for the first time in years, two oil-service companies recently went public. (They are <ORGANIZATION>Grace Energy Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Marine Drilling Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>.) 
<PERSON>Mr. Ramirez</PERSON>, who arrived late at the <PERSON>Sharpshooter</PERSON> with his crew because he had started early in the morning setting up tanks at another site, just got the first raise he can remember in eight years, to $8.50 an hour from $8.
<PERSON>Norman Young</PERSON>, a "mud-logger" at the <LOCATION>Sniper</LOCATION> well, has worked all but about nine days of this year.
<PERSON>Butch McCarty</PERSON>, who sells oil-field equipment for <ORGANIZATION>Davis Tool Co.</ORGANIZATION>, is also busy.
According to <ORGANIZATION>Baker Hughes Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, 992 rotary rigs were at work in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> last week, up from the year-ago count of 933. (In 1981, before the bust, the rig count was above 4,000.) Global offshore-rig use shows a similar upward trend. 
Grace Energy just two weeks ago hauled a rig here 500 miles from <LOCATION>Caspar</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyo.</LOCATION>, to drill the <LOCATION>Bilbrey</LOCATION> well, a 15,000-foot, $1-million-plus natural gas well.
For <PERSON>Zel Herring</PERSON>, owner and a cook at the <ORGANIZATION>Sandhills Luncheon Cafe</ORGANIZATION>, a tin building in <LOCATION>midtown</LOCATION>, all this has made for a very good year.
As followers of the debate over a capital-gains tax cut know, there is much talk in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and indeed all over <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> about the need to "encourage" long-term investment and discourage the financial sector's presumed obsession with the short term.
The issue of seeking relief from <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> was raised to <PERSON>Delbert Staley</PERSON>, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Nynex</ORGANIZATION>.
I see <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> as a last resort." Healthy thrifts such as <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> or the junk-bond market itself should have been so lucky.
The reality of life in modern <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is that if you want to wreck something that works, let it fall into the hands of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.

"Caution should . . . be the rule of the day," said <PERSON>Mr. Leigh-Pemberton</PERSON> in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION>Association of Corporate Treasurers</ORGANIZATION>' annual dinner. "It would be damaging to industry and to the financial sector in general, to say nothing of banks, if prudence does not guide the financing of leveraged transactions." 
Bank of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> officials said the central bank had no comment on <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>'s resignation. 
<PERSON>Mr. Leigh-Pemberton</PERSON> reiterated that the exposure of <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> banks to leveraged deals haven't yet reached "worrying levels." However, in light of the risks involved in such transactions, banks should satisfy themselves that they have the skills to participate in this market and clear policy guidelines on acceptable levels of exposure to such transactions, he said. 
We lived in rural areas many years, but now live in <LOCATION>St. Louis County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Shell Canada Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> said it plans to build a lubricants blending and packaging plant at <LOCATION>Brockville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>, with start-up scheduled for 1992. 
A spokesman said the plant, which will replace older lubricant and grease manufacturing plants in <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>, will cost about 50 million Canadian dollars (US$42.5 million) to build.
<LOCATION>Brockville</LOCATION> is about 100 miles east of <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>.

The conventional view, as voiced by <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ORGANIZATION> partner <ORGANIZATION>Fischer Black</ORGANIZATION>, is that stocks and "derivatives" such as futures and options "form a single market, and that derivatives make it a more liquid market." 
One group says the futures contribute to stock market volatility; the other contends that futures are a sideshow of speculation that detracts from the stock market's basic function of raising capital. "Before futures," says <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Michael Harkins</PERSON>, "you actually had to pay attention to whether the thing you were buying had any intrinsic value." 
When <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> futures prices jump up or down, the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> follows. 
<PERSON>Paul Lesutis</PERSON>, who manages more than $3 billion of investments at <ORGANIZATION>Provident Capital Management Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, blames futures markets for leading the way. "The fundamentals don't change in an hour," he says. "I think they should close down the futures exchange and then we could get back to investing." 
Although index arbitrage is said to add liquidity to markets, <PERSON>John Bachmann</PERSON>, managing partner of <PERSON>Edward D. Jones</PERSON>, says too much liquidity isn't a good thing 
<PERSON>Louis Margolis</PERSON>, managing director in charge of equity options and futures at <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, says that trading baskets of stocks began in the 1970s, a decade before the advent of futures.
Futures "don't need defending," says <PERSON>Andrew Yemma</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, which trades the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500, by far the largest stock-index futures contract. 
For one thing, the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> futures exchanges have political and financial clout -- including many friends in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
And traders say that futures have become an accepted part of the financial landscape. "All life is about change -- either you adapt or die," says one <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> futures trader. "If futures aren't permitted here, we'll take it to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>." 
Margin requirements for speculators on the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION> are currently about 7%. "For $10 million, you can move $100 million of stocks," a specialist on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> gripes. "That gives futures traders a lot more power." By contrast, an investor in stocks must put up 50% in cash. 
The <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 index futures "transferred the identity of 500 stocks into one unit-making them a simple commodity to trade," says <PERSON>George Kegler</PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION>A. Webster Dougherty</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>. "It took away the need to know the bad third-quarter report of <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>, for example," <PERSON>Mr. Kegler</PERSON> says. 
Of course, portfolio trading -- the increasingly common practice of buying or selling baskets of actual stocks -- also treats stocks as homogenous commodities. "There is a class of investor that wants to be exposed" to the whole market, says <PERSON>Sandip Bhagat</PERSON>, assistant vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Travelers Investment Management Co</ORGANIZATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> yesterday began trading in its own basket trading vehicle representing the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 stocks. 
Futures, on the other hand, are a zero sum game -- a market for making side bets about the direction of stock prices. "You don't own anything," says <PERSON>Stephen Boesel</PERSON>, a money manager for <ORGANIZATION>T. Rowe Price</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>. "You're making a pure bet on the market." 
The optical products company has signed a licensing agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Photoprotective Technologies Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a closely held firm in <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, which has developed a method to incorporate the synthetic melanin into plastic lenses.
Preliminary cost-of-living data for the current month are calculated based on inflation data from the four largest West German states -- <PERSON>Baden-Wuerttemberg</PERSON>, <PERSON>North Rhine-Westphalia</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Bavaria</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Hesse</ORGANIZATION>. 
However, the company's petroleum services segment, while profitable, was hurt by high financing costs associated with the company's buy-out of a 50% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Eastman Christensen Co.</ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION>Texas Eastern Corp.</ORGANIZATION> last June.
<LOCATION>Norton</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Texas Eastern</ORGANIZATION> had each held a 50% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Eastman</ORGANIZATION> in a joint venture. 
<ORGANIZATION>Norton</ORGANIZATION> announced earlier this month that it was exploring the possible sale of all or part of <PERSON>Eastman Christensen</PERSON>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Norwood Partners Limited Partnership of Boston</ORGANIZATION> said it may make a tender offer for some or all of <ORGANIZATION>Phoenix Technologies Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> 's common shares. 
<LOCATION>Norwood</LOCATION>, Mass.-based <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, a once-high-flying maker of software for personal computers, has had substantial losses in the past two quarters.
In a <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> filing, <PERSON>Norwood</PERSON> said it's part of a group that holds 525,546 <ORGANIZATION>Phoenix Technologies</ORGANIZATION> common shares, or a 5.3% stake. 
<LOCATION>Norwood</LOCATION> is controlled by <PERSON>Daniel L. Barnett</PERSON> and <PERSON>Paul A. Reese</PERSON>, both officers of Boston-based <ORGANIZATION>Oasis Capital Management Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a small <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> money management firm.
Also involved in the group is <PERSON>Robert F. Angelo</PERSON>, formerly <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>'s senior vice president, field operations, who left <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> at the beginning of October.
<PERSON>Mr. Angelo</PERSON> was described in the filing as a consultant to <ORGANIZATION>Oasis</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Unocal Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's decision to put its <LOCATION>Norwegian</LOCATION> oil and gas interests up for sale earlier this week is another step in the company's strategic review of its properties, and shows that few of them are sacred cows. 
But <PERSON>Eugene L. Nowak</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, forecast that the sale will bring in "$200 million or substantially more." 
The proposed transaction is the latest in a redeployment of assets by the Los Angeles-based oil company that has included the $200 million sale of its headquarters property and the pending sale of half of its <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> refinery and related marketing operations to <ORGANIZATION>Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.</ORGANIZATION> 
<ORGANIZATION>Unocal</ORGANIZATION> said it expects to complete the sale of its <ORGANIZATION>Unocal Norge A/S</ORGANIZATION> unit by next March or April.
In addition to an 18% stake in the <LOCATION>Veslefrikk</LOCATION> offshore field, the <LOCATION>Norwegian</LOCATION> unit has interests ranging from 10% to 25% in three other Norwegian oil and gas production licenses. 
In 1986, <ORGANIZATION>Unocal</ORGANIZATION> sold a 7.5% stake in the <LOCATION>Veslefrikk</LOCATION> field to Deutsche Erdolversorgungs G.m.b.
In 1987, it sold a 2.5% stake in the <LOCATION>Veslefrikk</LOCATION> field to the <LOCATION>Swedish</LOCATION> national oil company, resulting in a $7 million after-tax gain. 
We read with interest <PERSON>Robert Tomsho</PERSON>'s Sept. 28 page-one article on <PERSON>Robert Redford</PERSON> ("The Sundance Kid Gets Little Respect Around Sundance").
Misunderstanding conversations with us, <PERSON>Mr. Tomsho</PERSON> argued that <PERSON>Mr. Redford</PERSON>'s environmental views are at odds with <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> residents.
Recently, some 60 environmental and outdoor groups representing such divergent points of view as the <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Club</ORGANIZATION>, the League of Women Voters and the <ORGANIZATION>National Rifle Association</ORGANIZATION> joined together to request a reassessment of the environmentally unsound <ORGANIZATION>Central Utah Project</ORGANIZATION>.
In one of the most conservative, Republican states in the entire nation, the greening of <PERSON>Robert Redford</PERSON>'s neighbors is the real story that <PERSON>Mr. Tomsho</PERSON> missed. 
If <PERSON>Mr. Redford</PERSON> wanted to be accepted by the people of <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, he should have taken an advisory role instead of one of forcing his personal preferences.
In <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>Turner</ORGANIZATION>'s Class A stock closed at $50.50, down 37.5 cents. 
The issue has come to a boil in <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, where federal prosecutors have warned lawyers for <PERSON>Eddie Antar</PERSON> that if the founder and former chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Crazy Eddie Inc.</ORGANIZATION> is indicted, the government may move to seize the money that <PERSON>Mr. Antar</PERSON> is using to pay legal fees. 
The warning by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney's office follows two decisions by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> last June.
<PERSON>Mr. Antar</PERSON> is being investigated by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION>, where prosecutors have told him that they may soon seek an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges.
Under the <ORGANIZATION>Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations</ORGANIZATION> law, or <ORGANIZATION>RICO</ORGANIZATION>, the government has the authority to seek to freeze or seize a defendant's assets before trial. 
According to individuals familiar with <PERSON>Mr. Antar</PERSON>'s case, prosecutors issued their warning this week after one of <PERSON>Mr. Antar</PERSON>'s attorneys asked whether legal fees might be subject to seizure.
In a letter, prosecutors told <PERSON>Mr. Antar</PERSON>'s lawyers that because of the recent <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> rulings, they could expect that any fees collected from <PERSON>Mr. Antar</PERSON> may be seized.
Prosecutors have told <PERSON>Mr. Antar</PERSON>'s attorneys that they believe <PERSON>Mr. Antar</PERSON>'s allegedly ill-gotten gains are so great that any money he has used to pay attorneys derives from illegal activities.
<PERSON>Justin Feldman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jack Arseneault</PERSON>, attorneys for <PERSON>Mr. Antar</PERSON>, both declined to comment on the matter. 
In <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON>Samuel A. Alito</PERSON> said, "I don't think there's any legal reason to limit forfeiture of attorney's fees to drug cases." <PERSON>Mr. Alito</PERSON> said his office "just responded to an attorney's question about whether we would go after attorney's fees, and that is different from actually doing it, although we reserve that right." 
<PERSON>Mr. Antar</PERSON> was charged last month in a civil suit filed in federal court in <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>.
In that suit, the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> accused <PERSON>Mr. Antar</PERSON> of engaging in a "massive financial fraud" to overstate the earnings of <ORGANIZATION>Crazy Eddie</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Edison</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, over a three-year period.
Through his lawyers, <PERSON>Mr. Antar</PERSON> has denied allegations in the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> suit and in civil suits previously filed by shareholders against <PERSON>Mr. Antar</PERSON> and others. 
The <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> has alleged that <PERSON>Mr. Antar</PERSON> aimed to pump up the company's stock price through false financial statements in order to sell his stake and reap huge profits.
<PERSON>Mr. Antar</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> said, made more than $60 million from the sale of his shares between 1985 and 1987. 
Two of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s largest paper manufacturers, <ORGANIZATION>Oji Paper Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Jujo Paper Co.</ORGANIZATION>, posted unconsolidated pretax profit gains from a year earlier for the first half ended Sept. 30, on continuing robust domestic demand for paper products. 
<ORGANIZATION>Poughkeepsie Savings Bank</ORGANIZATION> said a plan to sell its <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> branch offices to <ORGANIZATION>First Citizens Bank</ORGANIZATION>, of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, fell through. 
The charge represents a write-down of the goodwill associated with <PERSON>Poughkeepsie</PERSON>'s investment in the banks it is trying to sell and its <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> branches as well. 
<PERSON>James Morgan</PERSON>'s pick for October -- Dynascan -- is a substantial 35% riskier than the market portfolio; his lauded <ORGANIZATION>Thermo Electron</ORGANIZATION> pick is 40% riskier. 
The <ORGANIZATION>European Community Commission</ORGANIZATION> challenged an agreement on routes and fares between <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s two largest airlines on antitrust grounds. 
Meeting in <LOCATION>Strasbourg</LOCATION> Wednesday, the commission voted, as expected, to formally object to the accord between <ORGANIZATION>Air France</ORGANIZATION>, the state-owned airline, and state-controlled domestic carrier <ORGANIZATION>Air Inter</ORGANIZATION>.
An <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the two companies will be notified so they can begin negotiations with <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> on how to modify the pact. 
At issue is an accord dating back to March in which <ORGANIZATION>Air France</ORGANIZATION> gained access to five domestic French routes under <ORGANIZATION>Air Inter</ORGANIZATION>'s flight numbers and the domestic airline got to fly to five cities outside of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> under the flag of <ORGANIZATION>Air France</ORGANIZATION>.
An <ORGANIZATION>Air France</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said, "we're absolutely ready to study all solutions." An <ORGANIZATION>Air Inter</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said, "Because they {the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>} have doubts, we will work again on the text and the contents of the accord." 
The judge handling the case in state <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>, a trial court, had tossed out the jury verdicts, ruling that the matter should have been handled under federal <ORGANIZATION>Occupational Safety and Health Administration</ORGANIZATION> rules.
<PERSON>Elizabeth Holtzman</PERSON>, district attorney for <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, said, "The appellate division has agreed with our view that despite federal worker-safety laws, state prosecutors have the power to protect working people." 
After his decisive primary victory over Mayor <PERSON>Edward I. Koch</PERSON> in September, <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON> coasted, until recently, on a quite-comfortable lead over his Republican opponent, <PERSON>Rudolph Giuliani</PERSON>, the former crime buster who has proved a something of a bust as a candidate. 
In an interview with reporters and editors of <ORGANIZATION>The Wall Street Journal</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON> appears quite confident of victory and of his ability to handle the mayoralty. "A lot of people think I will give away the store, but I can assure you I will not," he says. "I am aware we have real budgetary problems." 
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> State Comptroller <PERSON>Edward Regan</PERSON> predicts a $1.3 billion budget gap for the city's next fiscal year, a gap that could grow if there is a recession.
"He is going to face a mess," says <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Andrew Stein</PERSON>. "His supporters are not venal, but their solution to everything will be to spend more money, and he won't have any money." 
By and large, <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON> has finessed the touchy question of whose ox he would <PERSON>gore</PERSON>.
Instead of focusing on the financial future, <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON> has sold himself as a unifier for a city recently touched by racial violence and as a soothing antidote to 12 years of commotion generated by <PERSON>Mayor Koch</PERSON>. "The thing about the Dinkins candidacy is that it offers hope to a broad range of people," says <PERSON>Meyer Frucher</PERSON>, a real-estate executive and former aide to Gov. <PERSON>Mario Cuomo</PERSON>. "It is a feel-good candidacy." 
More important, he emerged as a peacemaker last summer after the Central Park rape of a white jogger -- in which a group of <LOCATION>Harlem</LOCATION> teens was charged -- and the racial murder of a black teen-ager in the white <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION>Bensonhurst</LOCATION>.
A story about how he mishandled the sale to his son of his stock in a media company controlled by his political patron <PERSON>Percy Sutton</PERSON> was allowed to fester a full week before <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON> faced the media.
His campaign was caught flat-footed amid allegations it paid almost $10,000 for what it said was a "get-out-the-vote" effort by black activist <PERSON>Sonny Carson</PERSON>, a convicted kidnapper who later said publicly that he is "anti-white." Critics have said the payment looked like an attempt by the <ORGANIZATION>Dinkins</ORGANIZATION> camp to get <PERSON>Mr. Carson</PERSON> to stop leading confrontational demonstrations protesting the Bensonhurst murder -- protests the campaign may have feared could cause some white voters to turn from a black candidate. 
<PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON> also has failed to allay Jewish voters' fears about his association with the Rev. <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON>, despite the fact that few local non-Jewish politicians have been as vocal for Jewish causes in the past 20 years as <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON> has. 
A former <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Marine</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON> got off to a quick start in politics, joining a local <ORGANIZATION>Democratic</ORGANIZATION> political club in the 1950s, linking up with black urban leaders such as <PERSON>Charles Rangel</PERSON>, <PERSON>Basil Paterson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Sutton</PERSON>, and getting himself elected to the state assembly in 1965.
But his chance to become deputy mayor under Mayor <PERSON>Abraham Beame</PERSON>, a plan boosted by <PERSON>Mr. Sutton</PERSON>, was squandered because of <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON>'s failure -- still largely unexplained -- to file income tax returns for four years running. "I always thought of this as a thing that could always be done tomorrow," he said at the time. 
The debt rose further in 1977 when <PERSON>Mr. Sutton</PERSON> resigned his position as <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> borough president to run for mayor.
<PERSON>Mr. Sutton</PERSON> recalls: "When I left, I sat down with <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON> {<PERSON>Rangel</PERSON>}, Basil {<PERSON>Paterson</PERSON>} and <PERSON>David</PERSON>, and <PERSON>David</PERSON> said, 'Who will run for borough president? ' And I said, 'You will. '" 
<PERSON>David Garth</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mayor Koch</PERSON>'s longtime media adviser, says of <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON>, "He really is the personification of the patronage system.
Colleagues today recall with some humor how meetings would crawl into the early morning hours as <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON> would march his staff out of board meetings and into his private office to discuss, en masse, certain controversial proposals. "He taught me how to drink herbal tea instead of coffee at 3 a.m., I'll give him that," says Deputy Mayor <PERSON>Robert Esnard</PERSON>. 
On the campaign stump, he often points out that he was the only <ORGANIZATION>Board of Estimate</ORGANIZATION> member to vote against a controversial real-estate project at <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Columbus Circle</ORGANIZATION>.
One <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> member, <ORGANIZATION>Bronx Borough</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Ferdinand Ferrer</PERSON>, was said to be so impatient with <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON>'s behavior at many meetings that he withheld his support for <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON>'s mayoral effort until late in the primary campaign. "I had some problem from time to time on the length of time he would take to make up his mind," <PERSON>Mr. Ferrer</PERSON> admits, but he maintains that he didn't delay his support of <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON> and that he backs the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic</ORGANIZATION> candidate enthusiastically. 
<PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON>'s campaign manager and former chief of staff, <PERSON>Bill Lynch</PERSON>, denies that the <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> borough president has taken too long to decide important issues. "We didn't rubber-stamp everything that came to us," <PERSON>Mr. Lynch</PERSON> says. 
That announcement was roundly criticized by <PERSON>Mayor Koch</PERSON> -- who has endorsed <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON> -- because the city faces a garbage crisis and has already spent $5 million planning for an incinerator that would be scrapped under <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON>'s proposal. 
And he favors a more cooperative approach toward the neighboring states of <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> in the battle over companies thinking of moving employees out of <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>.
Many economic-development officials say the Koch administration's aggressive approach helped save 5,000 <LOCATION>Chase Manhattan Bank</LOCATION> jobs from moving across the <LOCATION>Hudson</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Steven Spinola</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Real Estate Board of New York</ORGANIZATION>, an industry organization, says <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON>'s "economic development program is shortsighted, but when it comes down to it, he can be reasonable." 
A disheveled, roly-poly son of a <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION> potato farmer, <PERSON>Mr. Lynch</PERSON> is a veteran union organizer who worked on the presidential campaigns of <PERSON>Sen. Edward Kennedy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Jackson</PERSON>.
But as the <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> campaign hit tough times this month, <PERSON>Andrew Cuomo</PERSON>, the politically seasoned son of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> governor, is also said to have taken a more active role on strategy. 
Another close ally is <PERSON>Ruth Messinger</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> city councilwoman, some of whose programs, such as commercial rent control, have made their way into <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON>'s position papers.
But <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln Center</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Nathan Leventhal</PERSON>, who would head a <ORGANIZATION>Dinkins</ORGANIZATION> transition team, is more mainstream, as is real-estate executive <PERSON>Anthony Gliedman</PERSON>, another insider.
<PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON> also has said he would receive economic advice from a board that would include <ORGANIZATION>American Express Co.</ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON>James D. Robinson III</PERSON>, investment banker <PERSON>Felix Rohatyn</PERSON>, leveraged-buy-out specialist <PERSON>Reginald Lewis</PERSON> and attorney <PERSON>Joseph Flom</PERSON>. 
Names of possible deputies that have surfaced include former mayoral candidate <PERSON>Richard Ravitch</PERSON>, former schools chancellor <PERSON>Frank Macchiarola</PERSON> and Messrs.
<PERSON>Leventhal</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gliedman</PERSON>. 
Then there are <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON>'s old-time <LOCATION>Harlem</LOCATION> colleagues, such as <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>Rangel</PERSON>, former Deputy Mayor <PERSON>Paterson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Sutton</PERSON>.
Having attained positions of real influence or wealth, these men constitute the Old Guard of <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> black politics; they are less confrontational than the younger, more activist black political community that has been based largely in <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>. (Part of <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON>'s strength is his ability to win the support of both the <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Harlem</LOCATION> factions.) 
"We know there are potholes for the city out there," says <PERSON>Mr. Paterson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON>'s former law partner. "If any of us think we're going to sidetrack <PERSON>David</PERSON>'s determination to be the best possible mayor because of his obligations to us, we are making a sad mistake." Adds <PERSON>Ms. Messinger</PERSON>, who is expected to win the borough president's job <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON> is vacating, "You have to remember <PERSON>David</PERSON> is a pragmatist." 
Despite many doubts about his candidacy, white New Yorkers -- who gave <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON> 30% of their votes in the primary -- aren't expected to desert in sufficient numbers to turn the election to <PERSON>Mr. Giuliani</PERSON>.
The former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney, who prosecuted targets ranging from Mafia dons to Wall Street executives, has succeeded in raising questions about <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON>'s ethical standards, but so far has failed to generate excitement about his own candidacy.
<PERSON>Mr. Giuliani</PERSON> is finding that <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON>, in his many years in public life, has built up considerable good will that so far has led many voters to overlook certain failings. "The bottom line is that he is a very genuine and decent guy," says <PERSON>Malcolm Hoenlein</PERSON>, a Jewish community leader. "In the end, I think <PERSON>David</PERSON> will be judged for being <PERSON>David</PERSON>." 
Dime <ORGANIZATION>Savings Bank of New York</ORGANIZATION> was cleared by the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Starpointe Savings Bank of Somerset</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, the banks said. 
West German and <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> authorities have cleared <ORGANIZATION>Dresdner Bank AG</ORGANIZATION>'s takeover of a majority stake in <ORGANIZATION>Banque Internationale de Placement</ORGANIZATION> (BIP), <ORGANIZATION>Dresdner Bank</ORGANIZATION> said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Dresdner Bank</ORGANIZATION> said it will also buy all shares tendered by shareholders on the <ORGANIZATION>Paris Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> at the same price from today through Nov. 17.
In addition, the bank has an option to buy a 30.84% stake in <ORGANIZATION>BIP</ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION>Societe Generale</ORGANIZATION> after Jan. 1, 1990 at 1,015 francs a share. 
<ORGANIZATION>SYDNEY-Qintex Australia Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, under pressure from bank lenders, has called in accounting firm <PERSON>Peat Marwick Hungerfords</PERSON> to help oversee asset sales and restructure the resorts and media company. 
The appointment of <PERSON>Peat Marwick</PERSON>, which has a unit that specializes in advising troubled companies, came about as a result of a round of meetings held by <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Australia</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Christopher Skase</PERSON> with bank creditors. 
<ORGANIZATION>Qintex Australia</ORGANIZATION> is a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Ltd</ORGANIZATION>.
The Qintex group's problems began in earnest in March, when <PERSON>Mr. Skase</PERSON> agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION>MGM/UA Communications Co</ORGANIZATION>.
But the transaction faltered in September, when <LOCATION>Qintex Australia</LOCATION> was forced to increase its offer to US$1.5 billion following a counterbid from <PERSON>Rupert Murdoch</PERSON>; the deal fell apart altogether earlier this month. 
Last Friday, <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Entertainment Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, its 43%-owned <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> TV production and distribution affiliate, filed for Chapter 11 protection. 
The weaknesses of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> exchanges are driving some fund managers to switch business to stocks traded on <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s stock exchange, which quotes firm trading prices for about 350 blue-chip issues from 12 major countries. 
"I'm not saying <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> covered itself in glory, but the events of the past week have certainly exposed <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s weaknesses," says <PERSON>Stewart Gilchrist</PERSON>, a director of <ORGANIZATION>Scottish Amicable Investment Managers</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Glasgow</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>, which manages about #6 billion ($9.63 billion) in institutional money.
He says the problems on European exchanges included market-system breakdowns, delayed execution of buy and sell orders and trading suspensions. "The events strengthen <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s hand in becoming the center for trading European stocks," <PERSON>Mr. Gilchrist</PERSON> says. 
Unable to unload a large block of a French blue-chip company's shares in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> for two days last week, a frustrated Scottish Amicable fund manager finally tossed down her phone in disgust and called <ORGANIZATION>James Capel & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> brokerage firm.
The firm did the trade in seconds on the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> stock exchange's <ORGANIZATION>SEAQ</ORGANIZATION> automated-quotation system. 
In <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, more than half the top 25 blue-chip stocks -- including such giants as <ORGANIZATION>BSN</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Elf Aquitaine</ORGANIZATION> -- didn't open until Wall Street rallied late in the European trading day, traders say.
"<LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> was closed for two days, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> closed for a couple of hours, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> was stuck.
It was a nightmare," says <PERSON>Susan Noble</PERSON>, an investment manager at <ORGANIZATION>Robert Fleming Holdings Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>International Investment Management</ORGANIZATION> unit in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. "It's very worrying that these markets can't cope." 
On Manic Monday, the volume of German shares traded in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> more than tripled to 2.2 million, and the volume of French shares rose 48%. (By comparison, German domestic stock volume in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> only doubled that day.) 
For one thing, the size of the affected market is enormous -- the <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> stock markets account for some 22.5% of global stock market capitalization, with an estimated value of $2.175 trillion, according to <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley Capital International</ORGANIZATION>.
The switch to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> underscores the fact that despite the economic restructuring associated with <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> efforts to develop a single market by 1992, <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> stock trading remains a highly fragmented and very localized activity.
Rather, there increasingly is a group of international brokerage and trading firms that operate in most European financial centers -- including <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> giants such as <ORGANIZATION>Barclays Bank PLC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Deutsche Bank</ORGANIZATION>, as well as <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Nomura Securities Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
And senior officials of two <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> securities houses say they switched trades in European stocks to the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> market last week when they couldn't unwind positions on the Continent. 
Meantime, brokers on the Continent are worried, too, mostly by the potential loss of business. "I would be much happier if this volume {in German stocks} were in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> rather than <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>," says <PERSON>Dieter Bauernfeind</PERSON>, head of international equity sales at <ORGANIZATION>Dresdner Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>.
But they either didn't buy the right machines or they wasted it," says <PERSON>Fleming</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Ms. Noble</PERSON>. 
<ORGANIZATION>IMA Holdings Corp.</ORGANIZATION> completed its $3 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>American Medical International Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, purchasing 63 million shares, or 86%, of the Los Angeles-based health-care services concern for $26.50 a share.
<ORGANIZATION>IMA</ORGANIZATION> is a group that includes <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON>Pritzker</PERSON> family of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> through the leveraged buy-out fund <ORGANIZATION>Harry Gray Melvyn Klein & Partners</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Harry J. Gray</PERSON> and <PERSON>Melvyn N. Klein</PERSON>, along with five other <ORGANIZATION>IMA</ORGANIZATION> designees, were named to join <ORGANIZATION>American Medical</ORGANIZATION>'s 10-member board. 
In January, <ORGANIZATION>American Medical</ORGANIZATION> brought in a new chief executive officer, <PERSON>Richard A. Gilleland</PERSON>, 45, who will remain as chairman, president and chief executive.
In March, <ORGANIZATION>American Medical</ORGANIZATION> received a $24-a-share offer to take the company private from an investor group including large holder <PERSON>M. Lee Pearce</PERSON>.
It received more offers, but the auction was surprisingly won by <ORGANIZATION>IMA</ORGANIZATION>, which bid $28 a share and asked <PERSON>Mr. Gilleland</PERSON> to stay on as an equity participant.
Other new board members include <PERSON>John S. Harrison</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mark A. Adley</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>James F. Lyons</PERSON>, <PERSON>William S. Goldberg</PERSON> and <PERSON>Harold S. Handelsman</PERSON>. 
<ORGANIZATION>S.A. Brewing Holdings Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> began laying the groundwork to launch a rival offer for <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Holdings Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> 's Australian brewing operations. 
Such an offer could torpedo a plan by <ORGANIZATION>Lion Nathan Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> to acquire half the brewing interests.
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Companies and Securities Commission</ORGANIZATION> said it will allow <ORGANIZATION>S.A. Brewing</ORGANIZATION> to acquire an option on as much as 20% of <ORGANIZATION>Bell Resources Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION> that is in the process of acquiring <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's brewing businesses for 2.5 billion Australian dollars (US$1.93 billion). 
<ORGANIZATION>S.A. Brewing</ORGANIZATION>, which is 20%-owned by <ORGANIZATION>Elders IXL Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s largest brewer, will make a takeover offer for all of <ORGANIZATION>Bell Resources</ORGANIZATION> if it exercises the option, the corporate regulators said in a statement. 
<ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a brewing, property, media and resources concern controlled by financier <PERSON>Alan Bond</PERSON>, is selling many of its assets to reduce an A$6.9 billion debt. 
At a time when foreign banks are pouring vast resources and personnel into <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>'s financial center, the opening of a three-man office on a <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> side street shouldn't attract much attention. 
After an 88-year absence from the birthplace of the family banking empire, the return of the <ORGANIZATION>Rothschild</ORGANIZATION> group to <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> was greeted by the glare of television lights, curious reporters and a mayoral reception in <LOCATION>Town Hall</LOCATION>. 
Like other foreign banks establishing a presence here, the family describes its move as a calculated decision to set up a financial services outlet in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s largest economy ahead of the integration of <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> markets after 1992.
In 1796, <PERSON>Mayer Amschel Rothschild</PERSON> founded <ORGANIZATION>Bankhaus M.A. Rothschild & Sons</ORGANIZATION> and later sent his four sons to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Naples</PERSON> to begin the bank's expansion during the early 19th century.
The original bank in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> closed in 1901 after the death of <PERSON>Wilhelm Carl von Rothschild</PERSON>, and the family's banking activities focused on <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Baron Elie de Rothschild</PERSON>, the family's elder spokesman, explains that by the end of the 19th century, <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> had replaced <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> as <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s financial center.
Yet the chief reason for the closure, he says, was rooted in a family tradition that wouldn't allow a bank to bear the <ORGANIZATION>Rothschild</ORGANIZATION> name without a <ORGANIZATION>Rothschild</ORGANIZATION> in its management. "At the time we had only daughters," explains the 72-year-old patriarch, "so we had to close the bank." 
Although its palatial residence was destroyed by bombs during World War II, the <PERSON>Rothschilds</PERSON>' place in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>'s history is still recalled by the city park and a street bearing the <ORGANIZATION>Rothschild</ORGANIZATION> name. 
During the Third <PERSON>Reich</PERSON>, the <PERSON>Rothschilds</PERSON> were a target of Nazi propaganda against Jewish financiers.
The persecution pursued the <ORGANIZATION>Rothschilds</ORGANIZATION> across <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> as the Nazis grabbed countries, confiscating the family's property in the process. 
<LOCATION>American</LOCATION> journalist <PERSON>William L. Shirer</PERSON>, in his book "The Rise and Fall of the Third <PERSON>Reich</PERSON>," wrote of how in <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION> he had witnessed "squads of {Nazi} SS men carting off silver, tapestries, paintings and other loot from the <ORGANIZATION>Rothschild</ORGANIZATION> palace." 
Instead, it is to seek out corporate financing business and sell investment products on behalf of the family's mainstay banking units: <ORGANIZATION>N M Rothschild & Sons Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Rothschild & Cie.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Rothschild Bank AG</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION>. 
He left his job as general manager of <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> office because, he says, "When the <PERSON>Rothschilds</PERSON> called, I couldn't resist." 
In March, <ORGANIZATION>N M Rothschild</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Rothschild Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION> showed assets of #4.1 billion ($6.51 billion) and 1.26 billion Swiss francs ($774 million), respectively.
In <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Rothschilds</ORGANIZATION> banks are focusing on mergers and acquisitions as <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> industry restructures ahead of 1992.
"Obviously, there are quantitative limitations on the assistance we can provide," concedes <PERSON>Baron David de Rothschild</PERSON>, "but we feel we have some cards to play." Among them, he says, is the family's traditional ties to old wealth and decision-makers in banking and industry throughout <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and beyond. 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economy grew at a moderate 2.5% annual rate in the third quarter, the same pace as the second quarter, despite the worst trade performance in six years, the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> reported. 
You can't rely now solely on consumer spending to sustain the economy on a solid growth path," said <PERSON>Norman Robertson</PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION>Mellon Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>. 
Consequently, <PERSON>Michael Darby</PERSON>, undersecretary for economic affairs at the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION>, said inflation probably will edge up from the third-quarter rate in the final three months of 1989.
<ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Nicholas Brady</PERSON> called the 2.5% pace "good, solid growth," although he said he expects the expansion to slow in the fourth quarter.
"We were unprepared for the deterioration in net exports," said <PERSON>Daniel Van Dyke</PERSON>, vice president of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> forecasting at <ORGANIZATION>Bank of America</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. "I can't believe it will continue," he added, noting that the economies of the country's major trading partners are strong and prices of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> products are still competitive. 
"That suggests there is a little more inventory overhang than some people expected," said <PERSON>Edward Boss</PERSON>, senior financial economist at <ORGANIZATION>Continental Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. "I don't think it's anything that's going to cause a downturn in economic activity.
Analysts said the announcement, the latest in a series of divestitures and restructuring moves, is aimed at improving <LOCATION>Southam</LOCATION>'s earnings before the expiration in June of a standstill pact with <ORGANIZATION>Torstar Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
When that agreement expires, <ORGANIZATION>Torstar</ORGANIZATION> will be free to increase its 22.4% stake in <LOCATION>Southam</LOCATION>, or to make an offer for the whole company.
Descendants of the <PERSON>Southam</PERSON> family hold an additional 22.6% stake in the Toronto-based company, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s largest newspaper publisher. 
The acquisition of the <ORGANIZATION>Financial Times of Canada</ORGANIZATION> is "well within reach for any number of media companies, both public and private," said <PERSON>James Cole</PERSON>, an analyst with Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION>BBN James Capel Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
Possible bidders include <PERSON>Christopher Ondaatje</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> financier and vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Hees International Bancorp Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a holding company controlled by <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Bronfman</PERSON> family.
<PERSON>Mr. Ondaatje</PERSON> sold his stake in <ORGANIZATION>Pagurian Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Hees</ORGANIZATION> earlier this year and is said to be seeking a media acquisition.
<PERSON>Mr. Ondaatje</PERSON> couldn't be reached for comment, but <PERSON>Roy Mac-Laren</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>CB Media</ORGANIZATION>, a closely held concern that publishes two business magazines, said his company would take a close look at the newspaper. 
<PERSON>Mr. Cole</PERSON> said the sale of the 77-year <ORGANIZATION>Financial Times</ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION>Southam</ORGANIZATION> has owned since 1961, is consistent with <ORGANIZATION>Southam</ORGANIZATION>'s strategy of cutting costs to obtain maximum profits from its operations while disposing of "chronically under-performing" assets. 
<ORGANIZATION>Southam</ORGANIZATION> agreed to sell its 47% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Selkirk Communications Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a broadcasting concern, to <ORGANIZATION>Maclean Hunter Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> for about C$285 million last year.
The <ORGANIZATION>Financial Times of Canada</ORGANIZATION> has no links to the British daily newspaper, <ORGANIZATION>The Financial Times</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Nicholas Brady</PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> should grant the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> the power to close the stock markets in periods of crisis. 
In testimony to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> securities subcommittee, <PERSON>Mr. Brady</PERSON> disputed the view of <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Richard Breeden</PERSON>, who told a <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> panel Wednesday that he doesn't want the ability to halt the markets.
But <PERSON>Mr. Brady</PERSON> argued that the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> is closer to the markets and in a better position to understand when the exchanges are under such stress that they should be closed. 
Separately, <PERSON>Mr. Brady</PERSON> said he asked the <ORGANIZATION>Working Group on Financial Markets</ORGANIZATION> to determine whether futures margins are too low.
The <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION> margins for the <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor</ORGANIZATION>'s 500 stock-index futures stood at $10,000 a contract for speculators and $5,000 for hedgers before Oct. 16, 1987; that day the hedging margin was raised to $7,500. 
<PERSON>Mr. Brady</PERSON> also said he expects the leveraged buy-out phenomenon to "end under (its) own weight." Asked whether there is anything <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> should do to curb the LBO boom, <PERSON>Mr. Brady</PERSON> responded, "I think the LBO phenomenon, (while) it won't stop completely, will be a thing of the past." Before taking any action, he advised the panel to "see what the market has produced as a cure." 
But <PERSON>Mr. Brady</PERSON> endorsed the market-revision bill that both houses of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> will try to push through this session.
The bill also would give the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> the power to close the markets, a discretion that former <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>David Ruder</PERSON> wanted but <PERSON>Mr. Breeden</PERSON> doesn't. 
<ORGANIZATION>Northrop Corp.</ORGANIZATION> received a $93.5 million contract by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Air Force</ORGANIZATION> for production tooling and test equipment for the <ORGANIZATION>Tacit Rainbow</ORGANIZATION> defense-suppression missile.
The combined value of daily equity trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> and the NASDAQ over-the-counter market ranges between $7 billion and $10 billion.
It would be inappropriate for the government or the central bank to buy or sell <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> shares.
<PERSON>Mr. Heller</PERSON>, now at <ORGANIZATION>VISA International</ORGANIZATION>, was a governor of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Board</ORGANIZATION> from 1986 until earlier this year.
This is adapted from a speech to the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Club</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. 
A potentially safer whooping cough vaccine made by novel genetic engineering techniques was described by a team of <LOCATION>Italian</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Japanese scientists. 
Experiments showed that the new, non-virulent toxin is capable of inducing immunity, according to the researchers from the <ORGANIZATION>Selavo Research Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Siena</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Medical College of Wisconsin</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Milwaukee</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Japanese National Institutes of Health</ORGANIZATION>. 
When President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> travels to <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> today, he'll go with little of the fanfare that accompanies many of his foreign travels.
Some conservatives say <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> shouldn't make the trip, during which he will participate in <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>'s celebration of 100 years of democracy.
These critics object to <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>'s participation in a meeting that includes Nicaraguan President <PERSON>Daniel Ortega</PERSON> among the guests.
In addition, they argue he won't help <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s standing in the region by trumpeting the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> commitment to democracy less than a month after his administration played an ineffectual role in the failed coup attempt in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>. 
"I believe it will do more damage than good because it will legitimize people like <PERSON>Daniel Ortega</PERSON>," says <PERSON>Curtin Windsor</PERSON>, who served as <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> during the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration.
<PERSON>Mr. Windsor</PERSON>, among other analysts connected to the conservative <ORGANIZATION>Heritage Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, fears the gathering of 18 leaders, mostly from <LOCATION>Central American</LOCATION> nations, will force <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> "to explain and redeem himself" in the wake of charges that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> failed to do enough to aid the removal of Panamanian dictator <PERSON>Manuel Noriega</PERSON>. 
At the same time, liberal and moderate Democrats note the irony of <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>'s joining a celebration of Costa Rican democracy at a time his administration has sought sharp cuts in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> aid to the tiny country.
The administration proposed only $57 million in so-called economic support funds for <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> this year, down from the $90 million the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> provided last year. 
"We are crossing the river and we need a little more help to get to the other side," said <PERSON>Rodrigo Sotela</PERSON>, an economic affairs specialist at the <ORGANIZATION>Costa Rican Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. 
Democrats argue that <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> deserves more assistance for the same reason that <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> is attending the celebration this weekend: to reward the country for its stability in a region wracked with turmoil and for its efforts to promote peace in <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>. 
However, peace efforts by Costa Rican President <PERSON>Oscar Arias</PERSON> haven't always helped the country's cause in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Arias</PERSON>'s long-time refusal to support the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>'s campaign against leftist <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> earned him the ire of the <ORGANIZATION>Reagan White House</ORGANIZATION>.
And more recently, he insisted on signing a five-nation agreement intended to disarm <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>'s U.S.-backed Contra rebels faster than the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration would prefer. 
"I think <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s going there is a helpful sign," said <PERSON>Sen. Terry Sanford</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>) a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Relations Committee</ORGANIZATION> who pushed to provide <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> about the same amount of aid as it received last year.
While they acknowledge the president will attend several meals and a working session also attended by <PERSON>Mr. Ortega</PERSON>, they insist that <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> won't be extending the Nicaraguan leader any special courtesies.
Ten years ago, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION>El Espectador</ORGANIZATION>, of which my brother <PERSON>Guillermo</PERSON> was editor, began warning of the rise of the drug mafias and of their leaders' aspirations to control <LOCATION>Colombian</LOCATION> politics, especially the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
Within the past two months a bomb exploded in the offices of the <LOCATION>El Espectador</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Bogota</LOCATION>, destroying a major part of its installations and equipment.
And only last week the newspaper <ORGANIZATION>Vanguardia Liberal</ORGANIZATION> in the city of <LOCATION>Bucaramanga</LOCATION> was bombed, and its installations destroyed.
I can attest that a recent Colombian visitor to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> was offered drugs three times in the few blocks' walk between Grand Central Terminal and the <ORGANIZATION>Waldorf Astoria Hotel</ORGANIZATION> in midtown <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>.
What is of much more importance to the <LOCATION>Colombian</LOCATION> economy than the supposed benefits of laundered drug money is higher prices for <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>'s legitimate products.
A just price and an open market for what <LOCATION>Colombian</LOCATION> produces and exports should be the policy of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
<PERSON>Mr. Cano</PERSON> is president of <ORGANIZATION>El Espectador</ORGANIZATION>, a newspaper founded by his grandfather. 
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s unemployment rate was steady at a seasonally adjusted 9.5% in September, the <ORGANIZATION>Social Affairs Ministry</ORGANIZATION> said. 
<PERSON>Bruno DeGol</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>DeGol Brothers Lumber</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Gallitzin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, was named a director of this bank-holding company, expanding the board to 11 members. 
<ORGANIZATION>Weirton Steel Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it reached a tentative agreement on a 48-month labor contract with the <ORGANIZATION>Independent Steelworkers Union</ORGANIZATION> covering production and maintenance employees. 
Such is the fiber of the wool that woolly intellectuals let fly at gatherings of <ORGANIZATION>Harvard University</ORGANIZATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION>Society of Nerds and Geeks</ORGANIZATION>, or SONG. SONGsters are mad as heck about campus anti-intellectualism and they aren't going to take it anymore, at least not without trying a few really neat ideas first. 
"We could have called ourselves the <ORGANIZATION>Academic Intellectual Society</ORGANIZATION>, but then everyone would have said, `Oh, you mean the nerd-and-geek club, '" <PERSON>Leonid Fridman</PERSON>, SONG's graduate-student adviser, told 19 attendees at the club's inaugural meeting earlier this month.
But SONG founder <PERSON>Jeremy Kahn</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> junior, thinks of nerds and geeks more as "nonconformists," albeit with a studious bent.
One of its "more ambitious goals" is to get <PERSON>Jaime Escalante</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> high-school mathematics teacher featured in the film "Stand and Deliver," to come to <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> for a guest lecture. 
The Philippine government awarded <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION>'s Outokumpu Oy the contract to upgrade the facilities of <ORGANIZATION>Philippine Associated Smelting & Refining Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, according to documents from <ORGANIZATION>National Development Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION>Philippine</LOCATION> company's owners.

This is slightly adapted from remarks Oct. 7 by former Secretary of State <PERSON>George P. Shultz</PERSON> to an alumni gathering at the <ORGANIZATION>Stanford Business School</ORGANIZATION>, where he has returned to the faculty: 
<PERSON>Scott Miller</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>FASB</ORGANIZATION> project manager, said that a final rule will be issued before year end.
<ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> employers fear that the <ORGANIZATION>EC Commission</ORGANIZATION>'s plans for a "charter of fundamental social rights" is a danger to industrial competitiveness. 
"We don't want <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> deciding conditions for workers unless they are necessary and useful," said <PERSON>Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz</PERSON>, secretary general of the employers' confederation <ORGANIZATION>Unice</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Unice</ORGANIZATION> -- an acronym for the <ORGANIZATION>Union of Industrial and Employers</ORGANIZATION>' Confederations of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> -- fears that the charter will force <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> countries to adopt a single pattern in labor relations.
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> will propose a slightly watered-down version of the charter to be discussed by <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> social-affairs ministers on Monday, officials said.
But the cosmetic changes aren't expected to win over <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. "We still have serious differences with the text," a <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> official said, because it provides for a "regulation of the labor market." 
<PERSON>Mr. Tyszkiewicz</PERSON> said the charter would put poorer <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> countries such as <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> at a disadvantage.
Indeed, lower wages -- in <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>, they are a third of the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> average -- aren't enough to offset higher transport costs and lower productivity in the southern countries.
But the <ORGANIZATION>Unice</ORGANIZATION> official said that producing a charter acceptable to both <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> industry isn't an unattainable goal.
One possible political solution, an <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> official said, would be for the commission to present the action program in late November, before the adoption of the charter at a summit of <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> governments on Dec. 8 and 9.
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s Socialist government, which currently holds the council's rotating presidency, is committed to having the charter adopted by all 12 <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> states before the end of 1989 -- the bicentennial of the French revolution and its "<ORGANIZATION>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</ORGANIZATION>." 
<ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Chevrolet</ORGANIZATION> division said it is offering $750 cash incentives on all 1990 models of its full-size Blazer and Suburban truck lines.
<PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>'s resignation shocked many analysts, despite the recent recurring speculation of a rift between the chancellor and Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON>. 
Indeed, only hours earlier, <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> had called <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>'s economic policies "sound" and said she has "always supported" him. 
"There was a general feeling that we'd seen the worst," said <PERSON>Patrick Foley</PERSON>, deputy chief economic adviser for <ORGANIZATION>Lloyds Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. "The resignation came as a great surprise." 
<PERSON>Graham Beale</PERSON>, manager of foreign-exchange operations at <ORGANIZATION>Hong Kong & Shanghai Banking Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, added that <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>'s comments reinforced the market's growing confidence about sterling and compounded the unit's later decline. 
In <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Friday, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> currency opened for trading at 142.02 yen, up from Thursday's <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> close of 141.90 yen. 
<PERSON>Mr. Foley</PERSON> of Lloyds noted that <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>'s replacement, <PERSON>John Major</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> foreign minister, will take time to establish his credibility and, in the meantime, sterling could trend downward in volatile trade. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Foley</PERSON> predicted few economic policy changes ahead, commenting that <PERSON>Mr. Major</PERSON> shares "a very similar view of the world" with <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Bob Chandross</PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION>Lloyds Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, also noted that the pound's sharp decline is pegged more to uncertainty in the market than a vision of altered <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> economic policies. 
Unless <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>'s resignation leads to a change in British interest-rate policy -- <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>'s administration firmly supports high interest rates to keep inflation in check -- or posturing toward full inclusion in the European Monetary System's exchange-rate mechanism, <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>'s withdrawal will have little long-term impact on exchange rates, <PERSON>Mr. Chandross</PERSON> concluded. 
Also announcing his resignation Thursday was <PERSON>Alan Walters</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>'s economic adviser and <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>'s nemesis. 
The pound, which had been trading at about $1.6143 in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> prior to <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>'s announcement, sank more than two cents to $1.5930, prompting the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Bank</ORGANIZATION> to buy pounds for dollars.
The <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>'s move, however, only proved a stopgap to the pound's slide and the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> intervened for a second time at around $1.5825, according to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> traders. 
On the <ORGANIZATION>Commodity Exchange</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, gold for current delivery rose $3.40 to $372.50 an ounce in heavy trading.
<ORGANIZATION>Iverson Technology Corp.</ORGANIZATION> was one of the fastest-growing small companies in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> -- until last year. 
The <LOCATION>McLean</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, company modifies computers to keep sensitive military data out of unfriendly hands.
After quadrupling annual earnings over four years to $6.8 million in 1988, the <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, company, posted a 23% drop in earnings for this year's first half. 
In the belief that development of advanced military technology will remain a top <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION> priority, <ORGANIZATION>ERC</ORGANIZATION> last year acquired <ORGANIZATION>W.J. Schafer Associates</ORGANIZATION>, a technical and scientific analysis company with contracts under the <ORGANIZATION>Strategic Defense Initiative</ORGANIZATION>.
While the SDI anti-missile program recently awarded <PERSON>W.J. Schafer</PERSON> two contracts totaling $13.4 million, <ORGANIZATION>ERC</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and founder, <PERSON>Jack Aalseth</PERSON>, says he bought the company "more for its technology than its customer." 
<ORGANIZATION>UNC Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION>Annapolis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, contractor that earned $23.8 million on revenue of $400.4 million in 1988, has gone even further in realigning its military business.
Earlier this month, <PERSON>Mr. Iverson</PERSON> agreed to buy exclusive rights to a software system developed by <ORGANIZATION>Visher Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Salt Lake City</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Iverson</PERSON> says there are 5,000 potential customers for the software in the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, area alone. 
<ORGANIZATION>QuesTech Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Falls Church</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, also has acquired some companies outside the military market.
A partnership with a <LOCATION>Williamsburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, unit of <ORGANIZATION>Shell Oil Co.</ORGANIZATION> recently patented a process for producing plastic food containers that won't melt in microwave ovens. 
"We're trying to take the imagination and talent of our engineers and come up with new processes for industry," says <PERSON>Vincent Salvatori</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>QuesTech</ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive. "It is an effort to branch out from the government, which is very difficult for a defense contractor." 
Instead of helping his company in the defense spending slowdown, <ORGANIZATION>Dynamic Engineering Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a troubled subsidiary that makes wind tunnels for the space industry, contributed to much of <ORGANIZATION>QuesTech</ORGANIZATION>'s $3.3 million loss on $55.6 million in revenue last year.
<ORGANIZATION>Telos Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, provider of software-development and hardware-maintenance services to the military, enjoyed steady growth until this year.
Telos responded by combining three of its five divisions to reduce expenses and "bring more focus to potentially fewer bidding opportunities," says <PERSON>Lin Conger</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Telos</ORGANIZATION> chairman and controlling shareholder. "It's evident we're entering a more competitive era," he says. 
<ORGANIZATION>TransTechnology Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Sherman Oaks</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, defense contractor that earned $9.2 million on revenue of $235.2 million in 1988, provides a more dramatic example of cost-cutting.
"Our ordnance business has been hurt very badly by the slowdown," says <PERSON>Arch Scurlock</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>TransTechnology</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman. "I wouldn't say we're out of the business.
<ORGANIZATION>Boeing Co.</ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION>Trans European Airways</ORGANIZATION> ordered a dozen 737 jetliners valued at a total of about $450 million.
The 300 and 400 series aircraft will be powered by engines jointly produced by <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Snecma</PERSON> of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. 
But the news was even worse for <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION>'s core <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> retailing operation, the largest in the nation.
<ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION> said its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stores had a loss of $6.9 million, their first deficit for the period in more than five years.
But analysts say <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION> faces an especially daunting challenge on the eve of the Christmas shopping season. "I believe everyday pricing in the current environment doesn't work," says <ORGANIZATION>Walter Loeb of Morgan Stanley & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, pointing to soft durable-goods sales. "Sears is likely to be unsuccessful if it continues with its pricing policy when everyone else is offering unusual values." 
But the ad also mentions <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION>'s sales -- a topic that the retailer has avoided since switching to everyday pricing. "When <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION> has a sale at a special price," the woman in the ad declares, "it's something you don't want to miss." 
Recent surveys by <ORGANIZATION>Leo J. Shapiro & Associates</ORGANIZATION>, a market research firm in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, suggest that <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION> is having a tough time attracting shoppers because it hasn't yet done enough to improve service or its selection of merchandise.
The number of people who said they were more likely to shop at <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION> fell in September to 37% from 66% in March, when <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION> blanketed the airwaves with ads about its new pricing strategy. 
"The power of price as an appeal, which was very considerable in driving traffic in March and April, has diminished," says <PERSON>George Rosenbaum</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Shapiro & Associates</ORGANIZATION>. "You see some improvement in these other areas, but it's a very small and slow process." 
Net income at <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION>'s merchandise group, which includes international and credit card operations, as well as <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stores, fell 25%. 
Profit at <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Allstate</ORGANIZATION> insurance unit fell 38% to $126.1 million because of Hurricane Hugo, which inflicted the greatest single storm damage loss in the company's history.
Profit at <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group</ORGANIZATION> nearly quadrupled to $81.2 million because of gains on sales of property. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at $40.50, up 87.5 cents. 
The firms are <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>County Natwest Government Securities Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Greenwich Capital Markets Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
On Friday, the firms filed a suit against <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> state court asking for a declaratory judgment absolving them of liability.
Retired Adm. <PERSON>William J. Crowe</PERSON>, former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Joint Chiefs of Staff</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Robert P. Luciano</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Schering-Plough Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, were elected directors of this securities firm.
<ORGANIZATION>Manville Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it offered to buy $500 million of its convertible preferred stock from the <ORGANIZATION>Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust</ORGANIZATION> in a move that would improve the trust's liquidity and reduce the potential number of <ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION> shares outstanding. 
The trust, created as part of <ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy-law reorganization to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases, owns 7.2 million of the Series A convertible preferred shares, which are each convertible into 10 <ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION> common shares.
Based on <ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION>'s closing price yesterday of $9.25 a share, <ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION>'s offer would purchase about 5.4 million of its preferred shares, or about 75% of the trust's preferred stock holding. 
As part of its offer, <ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION> said it requested changes in some covenants between it and the trust to allow <ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION> to "reflect a more typical corporate ownership and financial structure." A <ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION> spokesman wouldn't elaborate on the proposed changes.
<ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION> said the shares issued to the trust were intended to be sold, as needed, and that <ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION> has the right of first refusal to buy those shares. 
Oil imports to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> rose 12% in September from year-earlier levels, according to statistics released by the government's <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of International Trade and Industry</ORGANIZATION>. 
Imports of crude from the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> grew 17% from year-earlier levels, and <LOCATION>Southeast Asian</LOCATION> crude imports grew 43%. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> has distributed these new guidelines for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Attorneys prosecuting <ORGANIZATION>RICO</ORGANIZATION> cases.
In order to ensure that the rights of all interested parties are protected, the Criminal Division has instituted the following requirements to control the use of TROs in <ORGANIZATION>RICO</ORGANIZATION> prosecutions. (It should be noted that these requirements are in addition to any other existing requirements, such as review by the <ORGANIZATION>Asset Forfeiture Office</ORGANIZATION>.): 
As part of the approval process for <ORGANIZATION>RICO</ORGANIZATION> prosecutions, the prosecutor must submit any proposed forfeiture <ORGANIZATION>TRO</ORGANIZATION> for review by the <ORGANIZATION>Organized Crime and Racketeering Section</ORGANIZATION>.
In seeking approval of a <ORGANIZATION>TRO</ORGANIZATION>, the prosecutor must articulate any anticipated impact that forfeiture and the <ORGANIZATION>TRO</ORGANIZATION> would have on innocent third parties, balanced against the government's need to preserve the assets. 
When a <ORGANIZATION>RICO TRO</ORGANIZATION> is being sought, the prosecutor is required, at the earliest appropriate time, to state publicly that the government's request for a <ORGANIZATION>TRO</ORGANIZATION>, and eventual forfeiture, is made in full recognition of the rights of third parties -- that is, in requesting the <ORGANIZATION>TRO</ORGANIZATION>, the government will not seek to disrupt the normal, legitimate business activities of the defendant; will not seek through use of the relation-back doctrine to take from third parties assets legitimately transferred to them; will not seek to vitiate legitimate business transactions occurring between the defendant and third parties; and will, in all other respects, assist the court in ensuring that the rights of third parties are protected, through proceeding under {RICO} and otherwise. 
<PERSON>Claude Bebear</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, of <ORGANIZATION>Axa-Midi Assurances</ORGANIZATION>, pledged to retain employees and management of <ORGANIZATION>Farmers Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, including <PERSON>Leo E. Denlea Jr.</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, if <ORGANIZATION>Axa</ORGANIZATION> succeeds in acquiring Farmers. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bebear</PERSON> added that the French insurer would keep Farmers' headquarters in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> and "will not send <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> people to run the company." <PERSON>Axa</PERSON> would also maintain Farmers' relationships with the insurance exchanges that it manages. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bebear</PERSON> made his remarks at a breakfast meeting with reporters here yesterday as part of a tour in which he is trying to rally support in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> for the proposed acquisition.
The bid is part of Sir <PERSON>James Goldsmith</PERSON>'s unfriendly takeover attempt for <ORGANIZATION>B.A.T Industries PLC</ORGANIZATION>, the British tobacco, retailing, paper and financial-services giant that acquired Farmers last year for $5.2 billion.
<LOCATION>Axa</LOCATION> has agreed to acquire Farmers from Sir <PERSON>James</PERSON>'s investment vehicle, <ORGANIZATION>Hoylake Investments Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, for $4.5 billion plus a $1 billion investment in <LOCATION>Hoylake</LOCATION>. 
Any acquisition of Farmers needs the approval of insurance commissioners in the nine states where Farmers operates, and <PERSON>Mr. Bebear</PERSON>'s trip will take him to <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> after his stay here; he will meet with insurance regulators, legislators, industry excutives and the press. 
Hearings on <LOCATION>Axa</LOCATION>'s acquisition application have been set for Nov. 13 in <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>; Nov. 20 in <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>; Nov. 24 and Dec. 4 in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>; Dec. 11 in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> state; and Jan. 8 in <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>.
Hearings haven't yet been set in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>.
Although <PERSON>Axa</PERSON> has been rebuffed by Farmers and hasn't had any meetings with management, <PERSON>Mr. Bebear</PERSON> nonetheless appears to be trying to woo the company's executives with promises of autonomy and new-found authority under Axa.
He said <PERSON>Mr. Denlea</PERSON> would be a member of the top management team of the <ORGANIZATION>Axa-Midi</ORGANIZATION> group of companies, and would "help define policies and strategies of the group." 
<ORGANIZATION>ALBERTA ENERGY Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Calgary</LOCATION>, said it filed a preliminary prospectus for an offering of common shares.
The company plans to raise between C$75 million and C$100 million from the offering, according to a spokeswoman at <PERSON>Richardson Greenshields</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Canada Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, lead underwriter.

<ORGANIZATION>Credit Local de France</ORGANIZATION> -- 100 million Swiss francs of 6%, privately placed notes due Dec. 1, 1996, priced at 100 1/2 to yield 5.91%, via <ORGANIZATION>Swiss Bank Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
Twenty-five years later, the Voting Rights Act has been transformed by the courts and the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> into a program of racial gerrymandering designed to increase the number of blacks and other minorities -- <PERSON>Hispanics</PERSON>, Asians and native Americans -- holding elective office. 
Examples of the divisive effects of racial gerrymandering can be seen in two cities -- <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>: Racial gerrymandering has been a familiar policy in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> since 1970, when <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> first amended the Voting Rights Act to expand its reach beyond the Southern states.
In 1972, the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> required that the electoral map in the borough of <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> be redrawn to concentrate black and Hispanic votes, despite protests that the new electoral boundaries would split a neighborhood of Hasidic Jews into two different districts. 
This year, a commission appointed by the mayor to revise <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s system of government completed a new charter, expanding the <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> to 51 from 35 members.
The <ORGANIZATION>Charter Revision Commission</ORGANIZATION> has made it clear that in response to the expectations of the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> and the commission's own commitment to enhancing minority political leadership, the new district lines will be drawn to maximize the number of solidly minority districts.
In this connection, it is important to note that several members of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s sitting <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> represent heterogeneous districts that bring together sizable black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white populations -- <PERSON>Carolyn Maloney</PERSON>'s 8th district in northern <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> and the south <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Susan Alter</LOCATION>'s 25th district in <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>, for example.
<LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>: The unusual situation in <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION> vividly illustrates the divisive consequences of carving out safe districts for racial minorities.
No federal court has ruled that the Voting Rights Act protects a white minority, but in June the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> approved a districting plan for <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION> that carves out three white-majority districts and six black-majority districts.
<PERSON>Richard Arrington</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION>'s black mayor, lamented the consequences. "In the past, people who had to run for office had to moderate their views because they couldn't afford to offend blacks or whites," he said. "Now you go to districts, you're likely to get candidates whose views are more extreme, white and black, on racial issues." Two hundred years ago, critics of the new <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> Constitution warned that the electoral districts for <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> were too large and encompassed too many different economic interests.
But <PERSON>James Madison</PERSON> refuted that argument in one of the most celebrated political treatises ever written, No. 10 of the <ORGANIZATION>Federalist Papers</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Ms. McCaughey</PERSON> is a constitutional scholar at the Center for the Study of the Presidency in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Falcon Holding Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it agreed to acquire about 54,000 subscribers from <ORGANIZATION>First Carolina Cable TV Limited Partnership</ORGANIZATION> for about $100 million, or roughly $2,000 a subscriber. 
The subscribers are in 52 different communities in <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>. 
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Falcon</ORGANIZATION> closed at $20, unchanged. 
<ORGANIZATION>Mobil Corp.</ORGANIZATION> is preparing to slash the size of its work force in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, possibly as soon as next month, say individuals familiar with the company's strategy. 
Sources said that meetings to discuss the staff reductions have been scheduled for Friday at <ORGANIZATION>Mobil</ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>. 
Individuals familiar with <ORGANIZATION>Mobil</ORGANIZATION>'s strategy say that <ORGANIZATION>Mobil</ORGANIZATION> is reducing its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> work force because of declining <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> output.
The <LOCATION>Waterbury</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, maker of industrial fasteners and metal stampings has 2.3 million shares outstanding. 
Early this century, diamond mining in the magnificent dunes where the <LOCATION>Namib Desert</LOCATION> meets the <LOCATION>Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION> was a day at the beach.
"If there's diamonds out there, we'll get to them," says <PERSON>Les Johns</PERSON>, <PERSON>De Beers</PERSON>'s engineering manager. 
Thanks to centuries of polishing by <PERSON>Mother Nature</PERSON> -- first in the gentle current of the <LOCATION>Orange River</LOCATION> that carried the stones from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s interior, then in the cold surf of the ocean, and finally in the coarse sands of the desert -- 98% of the diamonds uncovered are of gem quality.
Months after railway worker <PERSON>Zacharias Lewala</PERSON> first picked up a diamond from the sand in 1908, the German colonialists who controlled <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> proclaimed a wide swath of the desert -- about 200 miles north from the <LOCATION>Orange River</LOCATION> and 60 miles inland from the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> -- a restricted area, a designation normally reserved for military operations.
When the Germans lost World War I, they lost <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and the diamonds to <PERSON>Ernest Oppenheimer</PERSON>, patriarch of <ORGANIZATION>Anglo American Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and De Beers.
Still, miners from all parts of <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> as well as professional staff from <PERSON>De Beers</PERSON>'s head offices in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> keep coming.
Last year, when the rising <ORGANIZATION>Orange River</ORGANIZATION> threatened to swamp the course, the same engineers who are pushing back the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> rushed to build a wall to hold back the flood. "Nothing is too good for our golf course," says <PERSON>Tony George</PERSON>, a mining engineer. 
Probably the most clear-cut Soviet violation, for example, is the <LOCATION>Krasnoyarsk</LOCATION> radar. -- "Arms Control Reality," Nov. 20, 1984, the first of some 20 Journal editorials saying that Krasnoyarsk violated the <ORGANIZATION>ABM</ORGANIZATION> treaty. 
-- "Whether the installation is for early warning or space track, it clearly is not deployed," the lawmakers said. "Thus we judge it to be not a violation of the <ORGANIZATION>ABM</ORGANIZATION> treaty at this time." The delegation included a reporter from the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION>, aides to <PERSON>Sen. Edward M. Kennedy</PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON>Les AuCoin</PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION>Natural Resources Defense Council</ORGANIZATION> staff members. -- <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION>, Sept. 9, 1987. 
-- <LOCATION>The U.S.S.R.</LOCATION> has taken unprecedented unilateral measures of openness, by giving <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> representatives a possibility to inspect the building site of the Krasnoyarsk radar as well as radar vans in the areas of <LOCATION>Gomel</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, so as to see for themselves that there are no violations of the <ORGANIZATION>ABM</ORGANIZATION> treaty of 1972 on the part of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>. -- Letter from <PERSON>Eduard Shevardnadze</PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON>Perez de Cuellar</PERSON>, reported in <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION>, June 10, 1988. 
-- The construction of this station equal in size to the <LOCATION>Egyptian</LOCATION> pyramids constituted, I say it directly, a clear violation of <ORGANIZATION>ABM</ORGANIZATION>. -- <PERSON>Eduard Shevardnadze</PERSON>, Oct. 23, 1989. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION>'s recently issued "Soviet Military Power," though in general adopting a softer line, repeated the <LOCATION>Sverdlovsk</LOCATION> assessment.
It also was detailed in Congressional testimony this past February: An explosion at the <ORGANIZATION>Microbiology</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Virology Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Sverdlovsk</LOCATION> released anthrax germs that caused a significant number of deaths. 
Since <PERSON>Mr. Shevardnadze</PERSON> did not address this topic before the Supreme Soviet, the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>'s official position remains that the anthrax deaths were caused by tainted meat.
We doubt this claim just as we doubted <PERSON>Mr. Shevardnadze</PERSON>'s assurance last year that <PERSON>Krasnoyarsk</PERSON> didn't violate the <ORGANIZATION>ABM</ORGANIZATION> treaty.
And just as we did not believe the tendentious claims of the Congressmen and arms-control advocates who visited <LOCATION>Krasnoyarsk</LOCATION>, we are in no way persuaded by the assent to the tainted-meat theory by a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> team of scientists who met with Soviet counterparts in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> last year. 
<ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Matthew Meselson</PERSON> -- who we read has sold something called the "scientific community" on the notion that "yellow rain" attacks on the Laotian Hmong were in fact the result of fecal showers by giant bees -- found the Soviet anthrax scenario "completely plausible." 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government's <PERSON>Sverdlovsk</PERSON> complaint, as with <PERSON>Krasnoyarsk</PERSON>, is no mere political posturing.
<ORGANIZATION>USX Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it delayed the proposed initial public offering of common stock of <ORGANIZATION>RMI Titanium Co.</ORGANIZATION> because of market conditions. 
<ORGANIZATION>RMI Titanium</ORGANIZATION> is owned jointly by <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Quantum Chemical Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Sheraton Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Pan American World Airways</ORGANIZATION> announced that they and two Soviet partners will construct two "world-class" hotels within a mile of Red Square in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Soviet officials hailed the joint project as a new indication of the further thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations. "This is an outstanding example of how the East and the West can work together for their mutual benefit and progress," said Soviet Ambassador <PERSON>Yuri Dubinin</PERSON>, who hosted a signing ceremony for the venture's partners at the Soviet embassy here. 
<ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Robert Mosbacher</PERSON>, who attended the ceremony, called the undertaking a "historic step" in the evolution of U.S.-Soviet ties.
It will have a Russian tavern, an English pub, a discotheque and Japanese and <LOCATION>Italian</LOCATION> restaurants, according to a <ORGANIZATION>Sheraton</ORGANIZATION> announcement.
<PERSON>Sheraton</PERSON>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>ITT Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, will have a 40% share in the two hotels; <ORGANIZATION>Pan American</ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, will have a 10% share.
The Soviet owners will be <LOCATION>Mossoviet</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>'s city governing body, and <LOCATION>Aeroflot</LOCATION>, the Soviet national airline. 
Although a Finnish group has a minority interest in an already operating <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> hotel, the Sheraton-Pan Am venture will be the first joint-venture hotels in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> to have as much as 50% foreign ownership. 
<ORGANIZATION>Chevron Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Amoco Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Eastman Kodak Co.</ORGANIZATION> are among the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies known to be considering such ventures. 
<ORGANIZATION>Sheraton</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> said they are assured under the Soviet joint-venture law that they can repatriate profits from their hotel venture.
The <ORGANIZATION>Sheraton Moscow</ORGANIZATION> will charge about $140 to $150 a day for each of its rooms, and it will accept payment only in currencies that can be traded in foreign exchange markets, according to a <ORGANIZATION>Sheraton</ORGANIZATION> executive. 
<PERSON>Thomas Plaskett</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, said the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> airline's participation is a natural outgrowth of its current arrangements with <ORGANIZATION>Aeroflot</ORGANIZATION> to jointly operate nonstop <ORGANIZATION>New York-Moscow</ORGANIZATION> flights.
<PERSON>Alan Bond</PERSON>, chairman and controlling shareholder of the cash-strapped <LOCATION>Australian</LOCATION> media, brewing, resources and property concern, disclosed the debt figures yesterday. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bond</PERSON> indicated the consolidated debt figures, which include debt of units such as <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, will be published soon in <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's 1989 annual accounts. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bond</PERSON> blamed rising Australian interest rates and the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION> "with its very high levels of shortterm debt" for producing a condition "that was no longer sustainable. 
An investment in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s telephone company is carried at US$300 million but really worth US$500 million, and the company's property portfolio is undervalued by at least A$250 million, <PERSON>Mr. Bond</PERSON> said. 
The <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, company has 172.2 million shares outstanding. 
In a statement, <PERSON>Arnold B. McKinnon</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, noted that the new repurchase program "should serve to enhance shareholder value." A spokeswoman said the company will finance the buy-back with cash on hand, borrowing and "cash <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION> expects to generate." 
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Norfolk Southern</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at $37.875, up $1.125. 
Still, analysts don't expect the buy-back to significantly affect per-share earnings in the short term. "The impact won't be that great," said <PERSON>Graeme Lidgerwood</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
In addition, <PERSON>Mrs. Lidgerwood</PERSON> said, <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION> is likely to draw down its cash initially to finance the purchases and thus forfeit some interest income. 
Moreover, the extensive program in effect establishes a floor for the stock price, said <PERSON>Joel Price</PERSON>, analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Vickers PLC</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> aerospace, defense and automotive conglomerate, said it reached an agreed cash bid of #108.2 million ($173.3 million) for <ORGANIZATION>Ross Catherall Group PLC</ORGANIZATION>, a maker of specialty alloy and ceramics. 
The <ORGANIZATION>ULI</ORGANIZATION> is a non-profit research and education group based in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, with 14,000 members nationwide. 
The builders are more willing to give up some equity and rely on management and consulting fees to stay afloat in the soft market. "Developers are teaming up with institutions often acting as project managers," says <PERSON>Smedes York</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>ULI</ORGANIZATION> president and president of <ORGANIZATION>York Properties Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>Raleigh</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION> "They are growing more pragmatic about their role." 
Real estate firms are also using their alliances with financial institutions to amass acquisition funds. "Why should you beat your brains out fighting the environmentalists, the neighborhood groups, dealing with traffic mitigation, sewers and fighting city hall, then try to convince a lender to lend you money in an overbuilt market when you can get pension fund money, buy a portfolio, sell off pieces off it and play your own game?" says <PERSON>Jack Rodman</PERSON>, managing partner of the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION>Kenneth Leventhal Inc.</ORGANIZATION> a national accounting firm. 
The level of interest in the <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION>'s properties has been greater than expected, and has come from larger companies than initially anticipated, says <PERSON>Stan Ross</PERSON>, <PERSON>Leventhal</PERSON>'s co-managing partner.
Quips <PERSON>David Shulman</PERSON>, director of real estate research for <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc.</ORGANIZATION>: "A theme of the Urban Land conference will be `take a pension fund manager to lunch. '" 
<ORGANIZATION>Co.</ORGANIZATION> said it is establishing a subsidiary in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> to produce electric parts, including ceramic condensers. 
The <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> maker of ceramic capacitors said it purchased a plant in <LOCATION>Plymouth</LOCATION>.
On July 18, 1974, <ORGANIZATION>International Nickle</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> -- advised by <ORGANIZATION>Morgan</ORGANIZATION> -- offered $28 a share, equal to $157 million, for <ORGANIZATION>ESB</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> battery maker.
<ORGANIZATION>ESB</ORGANIZATION> said it was given only a three-hour advance warning on a "take it or leave it" basis from <ORGANIZATION>Inco</ORGANIZATION>, as the <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> company is called. 
"<ORGANIZATION>ESB</ORGANIZATION> is aware that a hostile tender offer is being made by a foreign company for all of <ORGANIZATION>ESB</ORGANIZATION>'s shares," said <ORGANIZATION>F.J. Port</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>ESB</ORGANIZATION>'s president. "Hostile" thus entered the merger-acquisition lexicon.
<PERSON>Joseph Flom</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Skadden</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Arps</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Slote</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Meagher & Flom</ORGANIZATION>, which became a leading legal firm in merger cases, said the case "made takeovers respectable." 
<ORGANIZATION>ESB</ORGANIZATION> spurned <ORGANIZATION>Inco</ORGANIZATION> and within five days <ORGANIZATION>ESB</ORGANIZATION> had a "white knight" as <ORGANIZATION>United Aircraft</ORGANIZATION> -- headed by <PERSON>Harry Gray</PERSON>, a shrewdly friendly acquirer of companies -- offered $34 a share.
Gray was advised by <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION>.
Within a few days in July, <ORGANIZATION>Inco</ORGANIZATION> raised its bid to $36 and <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> matched it.
<ORGANIZATION>ESB</ORGANIZATION> on July 29 accepted the <ORGANIZATION>Inco</ORGANIZATION> offer and the brief battle -- unlike the intricate and lengthy big takeovers of 1984-1989 -- was over.
<ORGANIZATION>Inco</ORGANIZATION> paid <ORGANIZATION>Morgan</ORGANIZATION> an advisory fee of about $250,000, a paltry figure by today's measures.
Early this year <ORGANIZATION>Morgan</ORGANIZATION> and three other investment houses each received $25 million in advisory fees from <ORGANIZATION>Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts</ORGANIZATION> in its $25 billion friendly buy-out of <ORGANIZATION>RJR Nabisco</ORGANIZATION>. 
The weight of <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>'s history was also against him; and it is a history <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> is in danger of repeating. 
Like <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>, and however unfairly, <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> is regarded by the Arab world as a colonial aberration.
Like <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> is being remade by demography.
In <LOCATION>Greater Israel</LOCATION> more than half the children under six are <PERSON>Muslims</PERSON>.
Unlike the Maronites, <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>'s Jews will not let themselves become the weakest force in a system of private armies; <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION> will become <LOCATION>Belfast</LOCATION> before it becomes <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s winning streak came to an end, and stocks fell in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> and across <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> as well. 
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Financial Times</ORGANIZATION> 100-share index shed 40.4 points to finish at 2149.3.
At <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s close, the <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> Industrial Average was 51.23 points lower at 2611.68. 
Dealers said the initial pressure came from mildly disappointing <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> trade figures for September and a worrisome report by the <ORGANIZATION>Confederation of British Industry</ORGANIZATION> that a decline in orders for manufactured goods is depressing both business optimism and investment plans for the coming year. 
The trade and <ORGANIZATION>CBI</ORGANIZATION> reports refocused attention on high interest rates and corporate profitability and helped rekindle underlying concerns over prospects for a recession in the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION>, dealers said. 
British life insurer <ORGANIZATION>London & General</ORGANIZATION>, which firmed 2 pence to 356 pence ($5.70), and composite insurer <ORGANIZATION>Royal Insurance</ORGANIZATION>, which finished 13 lower at 475, were featured in the talk.
On the life insurance side, <ORGANIZATION>Pearl Group</ORGANIZATION> finished 5 lower at 640, and <ORGANIZATION>Sun Life</ORGANIZATION> dropped 15 to #11.53. 
Dealers said the market didn't react substantially to <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's disclosure to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> that it will seek 100% of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s shares outstanding when <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> government share regulations are lifted at the end of next year. 
In early trading in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION>Nikkei</ORGANIZATION> index rose 17.92 points to 35544.47. 
<PERSON>Toshiyuki Nishimura</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Yamaichi Securities</ORGANIZATION>, said, "The market sentiment is bullish, simply because there are few bad factors." 
On the other hand, high-priced shares such as <ORGANIZATION>Pioneer Electronic</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> failed to spark investor interest because these issues are unlikely to be bought by investment trust funds, observers said. 
<ORGANIZATION>TDK</ORGANIZATION> fell 120 to 5,960, <ORGANIZATION>Fuji Photo Film</ORGANIZATION> declined 160 to 4,830, and <ORGANIZATION>Fanuc</ORGANIZATION> dropped 160 to 7,440. 
On Sunday, the governing <ORGANIZATION>Christian Democratic Union</ORGANIZATION> suffered a series of setbacks, the extent of which became fully known only late Monday, in municipal elections in <ORGANIZATION>Baden-Wuerttemberg</ORGANIZATION>.
And statements by the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>IG Metall</ORGANIZATION> labor union, <PERSON>Franz Steinkuehler</PERSON>, also cast a cloud over trading, dealers said.
<PERSON>Mr. Steinkuehler</PERSON> said at a convention in <LOCATION>West Berlin</LOCATION> that the union has to prepare for "a big fight" to achieve its main goal of a 35-hour workweek, down from current 37-hour workweek. 
The decline in prices cut broadly through the blue-chip issues, as <ORGANIZATION>Siemens</ORGANIZATION> tumbled 7.5 to 544, <ORGANIZATION>Deutsche Bank</ORGANIZATION> plunged 7 to 657, and the auto makers fell sharply as well.
<ORGANIZATION>Daimler-Benz</ORGANIZATION> dropped 12.5 to 710.5, <PERSON>Bayerische Motoren Werke</PERSON> dropped 10.5 to 543.5, and <ORGANIZATION>Volkswagen</ORGANIZATION> lost 7.1. 
Elsewhere, share prices closed lower in <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>.
Prices closed lower in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION>, were mixed in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> and higher in <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>. 
Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION>.
In the process, 4.9 million shares traded, making <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> the second most active issue on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>. 
Munching pizza when they could and yelling until their voices gave out, the two <PERSON>Benjamin Jacobson</PERSON> specialists at the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> trading post yesterday presided over what can only be described as a financial free-for-all. 
He manned the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> post yesterday with <PERSON>Christopher Bates</PERSON>, 33, an energetic <PERSON>Long Islander</PERSON> who's a dead ringer for actor <PERSON>Nicolas Cage</PERSON>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> traders said a 200,000-share buy order at $150 a share entered by <ORGANIZATION>Bear, Stearns & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which was active in <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stock all day, is what set off the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> crowd in the late afternoon.
Both <PERSON>Jacobson</PERSON> traders, who had been hoping <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> trading would get back to normal, read the news about the unraveling of <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> takeover plans on the train into work yesterday morning.
<PERSON>Jacobson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bates</PERSON> walked on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> floor at about 8:45 a.m. yesterday and immediately spotted trouble.
Already entered in the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s computers and transmitted to their post were sell orders for 65,000 <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> shares. 
<ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>, which closed on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> Monday at $178.375 a share, traded in the third market afterward as low as $158 a share.
This month's Friday-the-13th market plunge spurred by <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> news wasn't as bad for the <PERSON>Jacobson</PERSON> specialists as yesterday's action.
<PERSON>Mr. Bates</PERSON> usually handles day-to-day <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> trading on his own.
<PERSON>Jacobson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bates</PERSON> but four other <PERSON>Jacobson</PERSON> partners, all doing their specialist-firm job of tugging buyers and sellers together and adjusting prices to accommodate the market.
The <ORGANIZATION>Bear Stearns</ORGANIZATION> order that marked the late-day turnaround caused a "massive buying effort" as <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> jumped $20 a share to $170 in the last half hour, said <PERSON>Mr. Bates</PERSON>.
<ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> traders praised the <PERSON>Jacobson</PERSON> specialists for getting through yesterday without a trading halt.
In <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> spokesman, "by way of policy," declined to comment on the company's stock or the specialists' performance. 
Said <PERSON>Earl Ellis</PERSON>, a <PERSON>Jacobson</PERSON> partner who got involved in the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> action, "It all starts all over again" today. 
<ORGANIZATION>Northeast Utilities</ORGANIZATION> raised its bid for <ORGANIZATION>Public Service Co. of New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION>, which is operating under Bankruptcy Code protection, to $2.25 billion from $1.85 billion. 
<ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION>'s raised bid, which was supported by <ORGANIZATION>PS of New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION>'s official shareholder committee, is a prelude to what is expected to be a round of higher bids by the other groups trying to acquire the company, the largest utility in <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>. 
The $2.25 billion value claimed by <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Hartford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, is the highest yet given to a bid.
In addition, <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> promised the <ORGANIZATION>State of New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION> that rate increases would be limited to 5.5% annually for seven years.
<PERSON>Wilbur Ross</PERSON>, financial adviser to the equity holders said, "Given the state's strong bargaining position . . . we believe the <ORGANIZATION>NU</ORGANIZATION> plan provides the best recovery available" to <ORGANIZATION>PS of New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION>'s equity holders. 
<ORGANIZATION>New England Electric System</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Westborough</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, has proposed buying the company for $2 billion as part of a plan that would require rate increases of only 4.8% annually for seven years.
The other bidder is <ORGANIZATION>United Illuminating Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New Haven</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, with a bid valued at $2.2 billion and and a proposal for seven years of 5.5% rate increases. 
<PERSON>Mr. Ravine</PERSON> succeeds <PERSON>William R. Mansfield Jr.</PERSON>, who will remain with the company until the end of the year to support the transition and to complete important projects. 
The most recent <ORGANIZATION>OTC</ORGANIZATION> short interest statistics were compiled Oct. 13, the day the <ORGANIZATION>Nasdaq</ORGANIZATION> composite index slid 3% and the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> tumbled 7%.
However, the short interest figures reported by brokerage and securities clearing firms to the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Securities Dealers</ORGANIZATION> include only those trades completed, or settled, by Oct. 13, rather than trades that occurred on that day, according to <PERSON>Gene Finn</PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION>NASD</ORGANIZATION>. Generally, it takes five business days to transfer stock and to take the other steps necessary to settle a trade. 
The sharp rise in <ORGANIZATION>OTC</ORGANIZATION> short interest compares with the 4.2% decline in short interest on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> and the 3% rise on the <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> during the September-October period. 
Big stocks with large short interest gains as of Oct. 13 included First Executive, <ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>LIN Broadcasting</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION>'s short interest jumped 42%, while <ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION>'s increased 62%.
<ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION> makes semiconductors and <ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION> operates department-store chains and is strained for cash. 
<ORGANIZATION>Meritor Savings</ORGANIZATION> again had the dubious honor of being the <ORGANIZATION>OTC</ORGANIZATION> stock with the biggest short interest position on Nasdaq.
First Executive and troubled <ORGANIZATION>Valley National Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> were next in line. 
Short interest in the American depositary receipts of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, the target of both <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION>, more than doubled. 
Nasdaq stocks that showed a drop in short interest included <ORGANIZATION>Adobe Systems</ORGANIZATION>, Class A shares of <ORGANIZATION>Tele-Communications</ORGANIZATION> and takeover targets <ORGANIZATION>Lyphomed</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Jerrico</LOCATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>NASD</ORGANIZATION>, which operates the Nasdaq computer system on which 5,200 OTC issues trade, compiles short interest data in two categories: the approximately two-thirds, and generally biggest, Nasdaq stocks that trade on the <ORGANIZATION>National Market System</ORGANIZATION>; and the one-third, and generally smaller, Nasdaq stocks that aren't a part of the system. 
The <LOCATION>Stamford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, power-generation products and services company said per-share earnings were 56 cents compared with the year-ago loss of $2.39.
Net in the latest quarter included a pretax gain of $22.4 million from the sale of <ORGANIZATION>Combustion</ORGANIZATION>'s minority interest in <PERSON>Stein Industrie</PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION>GEC Alsthom N.V.</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>.
That "suggests the manufacturing sector is not falling apart," said <PERSON>Sally Kleinman</PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION>Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
Still, <PERSON>Milton Hudson</PERSON>, senior economic adviser at <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said: "If you look back a half-year or so the evidence was pretty good of affirmative strength in the capital-goods sector.
Fending off attacks on his economic policies in a <ORGANIZATION>House of Commons</ORGANIZATION> debate yesterday, <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON> said inflation "remains the greatest threat to our economic well-being" and promised to take "whatever steps are needed" to choke it off.
<PERSON>David Owen</PERSON>, <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> economist with <ORGANIZATION>Kleinwort Benson Group</ORGANIZATION>, reduced his growth forecast for 1990 to 0.7% from 1.2% and termed the risk of recession next year "quite high." But he said the downturn probably won't become a "major contraction" similar to those of 1974 and 1982. 
Still, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s current slump is a cause for concern here as the nation joins in the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>'s plan to create a unified market by 1992.
As a result, <PERSON>Mr. Owen</PERSON> warned, investment will be more likely to flow toward the other European economies and "the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> will be less prepared for the single market." 
Increasingly, economists say the big deficit reflects the slipping competitive position of <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> industry. "When the country gets wealthier, we tend to buy high-quality imports," <PERSON>Mr. Owen</PERSON> said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Apple Computer</ORGANIZATION> improved 7/8 to 47 5/8; <ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION> slipped 1/4 to 33 1/4, and <ORGANIZATION>Valley National Corp.</ORGANIZATION> was up 1/8 to 15 1/8. 
"The market started with several strikes against it," said <PERSON>Peter DaPuzzo</PERSON>, head of retail equity trading at <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton</ORGANIZATION>, referring to news that the labor-management buy-out of <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION> continued to unravel, and reports that the junk-bond market is disintegrating. 
While <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> doesn't do computer-guided program trading for its own account, the firm does execute orders for clients involved in the buying and selling of shares tied to movements in certain stock indexes, <PERSON>Mr. DaPuzzo</PERSON> acknowledged. 
Groused <PERSON>Robert Antolini</PERSON>, head of over-the-counter trading at <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette</ORGANIZATION>: "It's making it tough for traders to make money." He said that when sell programs kick in, many traders believe that "there's no sense in sticking your nose out because you're an instant loser." 
<ORGANIZATION>Lodestar Group</ORGANIZATION> said it will make a $6-a-share offer for the remaining Kinder-Care Learning Center common stock if it acquires a majority of the company's shares in a pending rights offering by <ORGANIZATION>Kinder-Care Learning Center</ORGANIZATION>'s parent, <ORGANIZATION>Kinder-Care Inc</ORGANIZATION>. Shares of <ORGANIZATION>KinderCare Inc.</ORGANIZATION> closed at 3 1/2, also up 1/4, on volume of 700,000. 
The company said the latest quarter included about $3.4 million in special legal and financial advisory costs related to <ORGANIZATION>McCaw Cellular Communications</ORGANIZATION>' bid for the company and <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION>'s merger pact with <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth</ORGANIZATION>.
Trade Representative <PERSON>Carla Hills</PERSON>, who along with <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Clayton Yeutter</PERSON> unveiled the proposal, said she is confident it will gain considerable support from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>'s trading partners.
<PERSON>Mr. Yeutter</PERSON>, seeking to allay European objections to an earlier <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> plan that called for eliminating all farm-trade barriers by the year 2000, said the new <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> proposal wouldn't "put farmers out of business" but would only encourage them to "grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants." 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is submitting the proposal today in <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION>, hoping that the initiative will spur members of the <ORGANIZATION>General Agreement on Tariffs</ORGANIZATION> and Trade to reach agreement on new trade rules before their current negotiating round concludes in December 1990.
Unlike the earlier <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> farm-trade proposal which struck <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> countries as too extreme, the latest plan would provide some room for maneuver.
For instance, the new <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> package makes clear there would be a transition period during which <ORGANIZATION>GATT</ORGANIZATION> members could use a combination of tariffs and quotas to cushion their farmers from foreign competition.
The goal would be to resolve disputes such as one prompted by the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>'s current attempt to bar imports of beef from hormone-treated <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> cattle.
<ORGANIZATION>Dunkin' Donuts Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, battling a takeover proposal by <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>DD Acquisition Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said that its directors will evaluate takeover offers submitted by Nov. 10. 
<ORGANIZATION>Dunkin' Donuts</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Randolph</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, previously said it would explore "alternatives," including a leveraged buy-out of the company, but hadn't set a date for submission of proposals. 
<ORGANIZATION>Dunkin' Donuts</ORGANIZATION> Chairman and Chief Executive <PERSON>Robert M. Rosenberg</PERSON> said "a sale is one alternative being considered," but he added the board hasn't decided whether to sell the doughnut franchiser. 
<ORGANIZATION>DD Acquisition</ORGANIZATION>, jointly owned by <ORGANIZATION>Unicorp Canada Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Kingsbridge Capital Group</ORGANIZATION> unit and <ORGANIZATION>Cara Operations Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, has made a $45-a-share tender offer valued at $268 million for <ORGANIZATION>Dunkin' Donuts</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Dunkin' Donuts</ORGANIZATION>' announcement followed <ORGANIZATION>DD Acquisition</ORGANIZATION>'s request to the <ORGANIZATION>Delaware Court</ORGANIZATION> of Chancery Monday to set a trial date for its suit against the company.
Trading in <ORGANIZATION>Cineplex Odeon Corp.</ORGANIZATION> shares was halted on the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> stock exchanges late yesterday afternoon at the company's request, <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> officials said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Cineplex</ORGANIZATION> traded on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> at $11.25 a share, up $1.125, before trading was halted. 
The current effort to auction off the company was triggered by a dispute between <PERSON>Mr. Drabinsky</PERSON> and the Toronto-based movie chain's major shareholder, <ORGANIZATION>MCA Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Boston Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's fall from grace is bad news for its parent, <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which has relied heavily on the banking and money management unit's contributions in recent years.
In 1988, for example, <ORGANIZATION>Boston Co.</ORGANIZATION> had an estimated pretax profit of at least $110 million, while <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> managed net income of just $96 million. 
<ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION> last week downgraded the long-term deposit rating of <ORGANIZATION>Boston Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Boston Safe Deposit & Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, to single-A-1 from double-A-3, citing problems in the company's "aggressively managed securities portfolio." 
<PERSON>John Kriz</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Moody's</ORGANIZATION> vice president, said <ORGANIZATION>Boston Safe Deposit</ORGANIZATION>'s performance has been hurt this year by a mismatch in the maturities of its assets and liabilities.
<PERSON>Mr. Kriz</PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION>Boston Safe Deposit</ORGANIZATION> "has taken some actions to better control asset-liability management and improve controls in general, and we think these will serve to improve credit quality." As some securities mature and the proceeds are reinvested, the problems ought to ease, he said.
<ORGANIZATION>Boston Co.</ORGANIZATION> officials declined to comment on <ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION>'s action or on the unit's financial performance this year -- except to deny a published report that outside accountants had discovered evidence of significant accounting errors in the first three quarters' results. 
The resulting scandal led to the firing of <PERSON>James N. von Germeten</PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION>Boston Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's president and to the resignations of the company's chief financial officer and treasurer.
<PERSON>Mr. von Germeten</PERSON>, in turn, attributed the controversy to judgmental errors by accountants and accused <PERSON>Shearson</PERSON> of conducting a "witch hunt." 
<PERSON>Mr. Kriz</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION>'s said the problems in the securities portfolio stem largely from positions taken last year.
Directors of <ORGANIZATION>Bergen Bank</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Den Norske Creditbank</ORGANIZATION>, two of <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>'s leading banks, announced they had agreed to the formal merger of the banks. 
The merger would create <ORGANIZATION>Scandinavia</ORGANIZATION>'s seventh largest bank, with combined assets of 210 billion <LOCATION>Norwegian</LOCATION> kroner ($30.3 billion). 
The banks said an application for a concession to merge into one entity to be called <ORGANIZATION>Den Norske Bank AS</ORGANIZATION> was sent Monday to the <ORGANIZATION>Finance Ministry</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Soichiro Honda</PERSON>'s picture now hangs with <ORGANIZATION>Henry Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Automotive Hall of Fame, and the game-show "Jeopardy" is soon to be Sony-owned.
A Japanese apple called the <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION> is cropping up in orchards the way <ORGANIZATION>Hondas</ORGANIZATION> did on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> roads.
By 1995 it will be planted more often than any other apple tree, according to a recent survey of six apple-industry sages by <ORGANIZATION>Washington State University</ORGANIZATION> horticulturist <PERSON>Robert Norton</PERSON>.
Some fruit visionaries say the <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION> could someday tumble the Red Delicious from the top of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s apple heap. 
Compared to the <ORGANIZATION>Red Delicious</ORGANIZATION>, the exemplar of apple pulchritude, the <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION> is decidedly more dowdy -- generally smaller, less-perfectly shaped, greenish, with tinges of red.
To hear most <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> growers tell it, we'd still be in <LOCATION>Paradise</LOCATION> if the serpent had proffered one to Eve. 
It has more sugar "than any apple we've ever tested," says <PERSON>Duane Greene</PERSON>, a University of <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> pomologist, or apple scholar.
It has a long shelf life and "doesn't fool the public," says <PERSON>Grady Auvil</PERSON>, an <LOCATION>Orondo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, grower who is planting <PERSON>Fujis</PERSON> and spreading the good word about them. "It doesn't look nice on the outside while getting mealy inside." 
Now, even more radical changes seem afoot as the grand old maverick of <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> apples plays the role of <PERSON>Hiroshi Appleseed</PERSON>. "The <LOCATION>Fuji</LOCATION> is going to be No. 1 to replace the Red Delicious," he says. 
Its roots are patriotic -- with the first trees appearing in 1872 in an orchard near <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, to be exact.
But the apple industry is ripe for change. "Red Delicious has been overplanted, and its prices have dropped below the cost of production," says <LOCATION>Washington State</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Norton</PERSON>.
The scare over <PERSON>Alar</PERSON>, a growth regulator that makes apples redder and crunchier but may be carcinogenic, made consumers shy away from the Delicious, though they were less affected than the <PERSON>McIntosh</PERSON>.
One may be <PERSON>William Broderick</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Sterling</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, grower. "This is beautiful stuff," he says, looking ruefully at big boxes of just-picked Red Delicious next to his barn. "But I'm going to lose $50,000 to $60,000 on it.
Though growers can't always keep the worm from the apple, they can protect themselves against the price vagaries of any one variety by diversifying -- into the recently imported <PERSON>Gala</PERSON>, a sweet <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> native; the <LOCATION>Esopus Spitzenburg</LOCATION>, reportedly <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON>'s favorite apple; disease-resistant kinds like the Liberty. "I've ripped out a lot of Delicious" and grafted the trees with many different shoots, says <PERSON>Steve Wood</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>West Lebanon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.H.</LOCATION>, grower, tramping through his 100-acre <ORGANIZATION>Poverty Lane Orchard</ORGANIZATION> on a crisp autumn day recently. "I've got 70 kinds of apples.
But freshness counts more than it once did, and stores are expanding shelf space for unconventional, but tastier, and often pricier, apples. "Rather than sell 39-cents-a-pound Delicious, maybe we can sell 79-cents-a-pound Fujis," says <PERSON>Chuck Tryon</PERSON>, perishables director for <ORGANIZATION>Super Valu Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION> supermarket chain and food distributor. 
In the cornucopia of go-go apples, the <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION>'s track record stands out: During the past 15 years, it has gone from almost zilch to some 50% of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s market. 
"The Japanese apple market is very keyed to high quality," says <PERSON>David Lane</PERSON>, a scientist at a Canadian horticulture research center in <LOCATION>Summerland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>British Columbia</LOCATION>, and so apples are more of a delicacy there than a big food commodity.
The <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION> is still small potatoes in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, sold mainly in fruit boutiques.
But in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, says <PERSON>Craig Ito</PERSON>, a Fuji-apple grower, "There's a Fuji apple cult.
<PERSON>Mr. Auvil</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> grower, says that he could sell <ORGANIZATION>Fujis</ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> buyers at $40 a box if he had them. (<LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> already is a big importer of Fujis from other places, he adds.) But his first crop won't be picked till next year. "I expect to see the demand exceed supply for <ORGANIZATION>Fujis</ORGANIZATION> for the next 10 to 15 years," he adds.
<PERSON>Mr. Auvil</PERSON> sees <ORGANIZATION>Fujis</ORGANIZATION>, in part, as striking a blow against the perversion of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> apples by supermarkets. "When the chain stores took over, there was no longer a connection between grower and consumer.
<PERSON>Mr. Broderick</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> grower, says the "big boss" at a supermarket chain even rejected his Red Delicious recently because they weren't waxed and brushed for extra shine.
Still, <PERSON>Mr. Auvil</PERSON> points out, <PERSON>Grannies</PERSON> became popular without big, red looks, so why not <PERSON>Fujis</PERSON>?
The latest results include a gain of $4.2 million, or eight cents a share, on the sale of television stations in <LOCATION>Oklahoma City</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Flint</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Robert F. Singleton</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Knight-Ridder</ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer, said the company was "pleased" with its overall performance, despite only single-digit growth in newspaper revenue.
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>Knight Ridder</ORGANIZATION> closed at $51.50 a share, down 12.5 cents. 
Net for the <LOCATION>New Brunswick</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, maker of health-care products climbed to $265 million, or 80 cents a share, from $240 million, or 71 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
<PERSON>David J. Lothson</PERSON>, an industry analyst for <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>Johnson & Johnson</ORGANIZATION>'s results slightly exceeded his expectations for the third quarter. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Johnson & Johnson</ORGANIZATION> shares fell 37.5 cents to $54.625. 
<PERSON>Mr. Larsen</PERSON> noted "substantial sales growth" for the recently introduced Acuvue disposable contact lens and <PERSON>Hismanal</PERSON>, a once-a-day antihistamine.
The company cited softness in the retail health and beauty aids category, "as well as the intense competition in the company's sanitary protection product line." Overseas sales were stronger, principally because of a rebound in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, where economic turmoil had hurt year-earlier results, <ORGANIZATION>Johnson & Johnson</ORGANIZATION> said. 
<PERSON>Mr. Lothson</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION> said the company's sales pace has been picking up largely because the effect of unfavorable exchange rates has been easing -- a pattern continuing this quarter.
While the third period contained no major surprises, <PERSON>Mr. Lothson</PERSON> said, the results show how sensitive the multinationals can be to developments in a single country such as <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Bergen Brunswig Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, proposed offering of liquid yield option notes, via <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Western Gas System Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, initial offering of 3,250,000 common shares, of which 3,040,000 shares will be sold by the company and 210,000 by a holder, via <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Capital Funding</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Smith Barney</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Harris Upham & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Hanifen, Imhoff Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Homestake Mining Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, blamed the continued slump in gold prices for an 83% plunge in third-quarter net income to $2 million, or two cents a share, from $11.2 million, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>Homestake</ORGANIZATION> closed at $15.25, down 25 cents. 
<ORGANIZATION>Wang Laboratories Inc.</ORGANIZATION> has sold $25 million of assets and reached agreements in principle to sell an additional $187 million shortly, <PERSON>Richard Miller</PERSON>, president, said at the annual meeting. 
He said <PERSON>Wang</PERSON> had reached an agreement with a "major financial firm" to sell for $150 million its domestic equipment lease portfolio and that of its <ORGANIZATION>Wang Credit Corp.</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary.
<PERSON>Mr. Miller</PERSON> said that <PERSON>Wang</PERSON> has already sold some $12 million of miscellaneous assets and disclosed that it had received $13 million from <ORGANIZATION>Compaq Computer Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, in the previously announced sale of its Stirling, <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>, plant. 
<PERSON>Mr. Miller</PERSON> repeated that in the next six months he plans to sell another $200 million to $300 million of assets to repay debt and reduce interest costs at <PERSON>Wang</PERSON>, a minincomputer maker in <LOCATION>Lowell</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>. 
That was when the tame old <ORGANIZATION>Peasants' Party</ORGANIZATION>, desperate to live through the crisis, broke ranks with the Communists and joined with Solidarity in the <LOCATION>East Bloc</LOCATION>'s first liberated government. 
At dawn on a cool day, hundreds travel to the private market in <LOCATION>Radzymin</LOCATION>, a town not far from <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION>, hauling pigs, cattle and sacks of feed that the state's official buyers can't induce them to sell.
"We are dealing with real entrepreneurs," says <PERSON>Antoni Leopold</PERSON>, an economist who advises <ORGANIZATION>Rural Solidarity</ORGANIZATION>, the union's countryside offshoot. "There are a lot of them, and they have property." 
A few miles past <LOCATION>Radzymin</LOCATION>, a dirt road narrows to a track of sand and leads into <ORGANIZATION>Zalubice</ORGANIZATION>, a village of tumbledown farms.
In <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, only 4% of all investment goes toward making things farmers want; in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>, it is closer to 20%.
"I've heard from friends that state farms are subsidized," <PERSON>Mr. Pyszkiewicz</PERSON> says as his wife, <PERSON>Wieslawa</PERSON>, sets some chairs out in the sun. "We have one near here.
<PERSON>Maria Stolzman</PERSON>, one of its farm experts, lays it on the line: "The <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> will be brought in to help us destroy the old system." 
It objected again in September when Prime Minister <PERSON>Tadeusz Mazowiecki</PERSON> reluctantly named a <ORGANIZATION>Peasant Party</ORGANIZATION> man as his agriculture minister. 
"We know how to get from capitalism to socialism," <PERSON>Sergiusz Niciporuk</PERSON> is saying one afternoon. "We don't know how to get from socialism to capitalism." He farms 12 acres in <LOCATION>Grabowiec</LOCATION>, two miles from the Soviet border in one of <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>'s poorest places.
"Many people in <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> hope this government will break down," says <PERSON>Mr. Niciporuk</PERSON>, who belongs to the local council and to Rural Solidarity. "That's what the naczelnik counts on.
<PERSON>David Shaffer</PERSON> was named to the new post of executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>Maxwell Macmillan</ORGANIZATION> group of this communications giant.
Also, <PERSON>Sheldon Aboff</PERSON>, formerly a vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Maxwell</ORGANIZATION>, was named group vice president with responsibility for various electronic and publishing-group companies. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials, however, said they aren't buying the <LOCATION>Israeli</LOCATION> argument. 
Israeli counterterrorism officials provided the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> with a 20-page list of recent terrorist incidents they attribute directly to forces controlled by <ORGANIZATION>PLO</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Yasser Arafat</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr. Arafat</PERSON> publicly renounced terrorism Dec. 15, satisfying the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> precondition for a direct "dialogue" with the <ORGANIZATION>PLO</ORGANIZATION>. 
A <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> counterterrorism official said experts are studying the <LOCATION>Israeli</LOCATION> list. "We have no independent evidence linking <ORGANIZATION>Fatah</ORGANIZATION> to any acts of terrorism since Dec. 15, 1988," he said, referring to the specific <ORGANIZATION>PLO</ORGANIZATION> group that <PERSON>Mr. Arafat</PERSON> heads. "So far, this list doesn't change our view.
<LOCATION>Israeli</LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON>Yitzhak Shamir</PERSON>'s top adviser on counterterrorism, <PERSON>Yigal Carmon</PERSON>, was here Monday to present the report to members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, reporters and others.
<PERSON>Mr. Carmon</PERSON> said he also presented the list last week to <PERSON>William Brown</PERSON>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Ambassador to <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>. 
Separately, the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> reported that the <LOCATION>Israeli</LOCATION> government had provided its correspondent in <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION> with different documents that <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> said prove the <ORGANIZATION>PLO</ORGANIZATION> has been conducting terrorism from the occupied Arab territories.
"If the dialogue was based on the assumption that <PERSON>Arafat</PERSON> or the <ORGANIZATION>PLO</ORGANIZATION> would stop terrorism, and we have evidence of continued terrorism, what would be the logical conclusion?" <PERSON>Mr. Carmon</PERSON> asked. 
<LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> has long claimed <PERSON>Mr. Arafat</PERSON> never meant to renounce terrorism, particularly because he and his lieutenants reserved the right to press "armed struggle" against the Jewish state.
Now, <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION> says it is backing up its contention with detailed accounts of alleged terrorist acts and plans linked to <PERSON>Mr. Arafat</PERSON>.
The new accusations come at a delicate time in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> efforts to bring about talks between <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Palestinian</LOCATION> representatives.
The <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> said it had received a new letter on the subject from <LOCATION>Israeli</LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON>Moshe Arens</PERSON>, restating <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>'s previous objection to negotiating with any <LOCATION>Palestinian</LOCATION> tied to the <ORGANIZATION>PLO</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> defines it as "premediated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine state agents." To meet the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> criteria, <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> contended it only listed incidents that involved civilians and occurred inside its pre-1967 borders. 
At the heart of <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>'s report is a list of a dozen incidents <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION> attributes to <ORGANIZATION>Fatah</ORGANIZATION>, including the use of bombs and Molotov cocktails.
But <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials say they aren't satisfied these incidents constitute terrorism because they may be offshoots of the intifadah, the Palestinian rebellion in the occupied territories, which the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> doesn't classify as terrorism.
In addition, the officials say <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> hasn't presented convincing evidence these acts were ordered by <ORGANIZATION>Fatah</ORGANIZATION> or by any group <PERSON>Mr. Arafat</PERSON> controls. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> terrorism experts also say they are highly uncertain about the veracity of the separate documents leaked to the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION>.
The papers, which <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> says were discovered in <LOCATION>Israeli-occupied Gaza</LOCATION>, refer to terrorist acts to be carried out in the name of a group called "the <ORGANIZATION>Revolutionary Eagles</ORGANIZATION>." 
Some supporters of <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> say <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> policy on Palestinian terrorism is colored by an intense desire to maintain the dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION>PLO</ORGANIZATION>.
But <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> officials accuse <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> of leaking questionable claims to embarrass the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
The <ORGANIZATION>Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Lexington</LOCATION>, Ky.-based trade group, has launched "seminars" for "potential investors" at race tracks around the country.
"People in this business have been insulated," says <PERSON>Josh Pons</PERSON>, a horse breeder from <ORGANIZATION>Bel Air</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION> "But the real future of this game is in a number of people owning a few horses." 
At the <ORGANIZATION>Laurel</ORGANIZATION> race track, the breeders are romancing people like <PERSON>Tim Hulings</PERSON>, a beer packaging plant worker.
Right now, <PERSON>Mr. Hulings</PERSON> is waving his racing program, cheering for <PERSON>Karnak</PERSON> on the Nile, a sleek thoroughbred galloping down the home stretch. 
But experts caution that this isn't a game for anyone with a weak stomach or wallet. "It's a big-risk business," warns <PERSON>Charles C. Mihalek</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Lexington</LOCATION> attorney and former <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> state securities commissioner. "You have to go into it firmly believing that it's the kind of investment where you can lose everything." 
Consider <PERSON>Spendthrift Farm</PERSON>, a prominent <LOCATION>Lexington</LOCATION> horse farm that went public in 1983 but hit hard times and filed for bankruptcy-court protection last year.
"It's just a matter of marketing and promoting ourselves," says <PERSON>Headley Bell</PERSON>, a fifth-generation horse breeder from <LOCATION>Lexington</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Katherine Voss</PERSON>, a veteran trainer at the <ORGANIZATION>Laurel</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, track, offers neophytes a sobering tour of a horse barn, noting that only three of about a dozen horses have won sizable purses. 
But some are skeptical of the code's effectiveness. "The industry is based on individual honesty," says <PERSON>Cap Hershey</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Lexington</LOCATION> horse farmer and one of the investors who bought <PERSON>Spendthrift</PERSON>. 
"People are waiting for {new} factory giveaways," said <PERSON>Ben Kaye</PERSON>, sales manager of <ORGANIZATION>Bob Brest Auto World</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Lynn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, whose sales are slow. 
Industry analyst <PERSON>John H. Qualls</PERSON>, a vice president with <ORGANIZATION>Hill & Knowlton</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, forecasts that domestic auto makers will have a 93-day supply of cars at the end of the year, even if car sales improve to a 6.5 million vehicle rate for the quarter.
The sales are being dragged down by a glut of 1989 vehicles, said <PERSON>Joel Pitcoff</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> analyst.
<ORGANIZATION>Town & Country Ford</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, still needs to move about 850 1989 cars and trucks.
<ORGANIZATION>Toyota Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which opened a plant in <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>, last year, saw sales triple to 6,256 vehicles. 
Criticism from such big advertisers as <ORGANIZATION>Estee Lauder Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Colgate-Palmolive Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Seagram Co.</ORGANIZATION> put a damper on the euphoria at the <ORGANIZATION>American Magazine Conference</ORGANIZATION> here.
"Magazines are not providing us in-depth information on circulation," said <PERSON>Edgar Bronfman Jr.</PERSON>, president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION>Seagram</ORGANIZATION>, in a panel discussion. "How do readers feel about the magazine?
<PERSON>Leonard Lauder</PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <PERSON>Estee Lauder</PERSON>, said consumer magazines are suffering from what he called "niche-itis,"the increasing number of magazines that target the idosyncratic interests of readers. 
<PERSON>Mr. Lauder</PERSON> also attacked what he sees as the wide imitation of <ORGANIZATION>Elle</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>fashion magazine</ORGANIZATION> published by <ORGANIZATION>Diamandis Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, and criticized the practice of stacking ads at the front of magazines. "Readers don't want to face all those ad pages at the front of a magazine," he said. 
Magazine editors did not take the criticisms lying down. "We spend a fortune on research information," said <PERSON>Steve Burzon</PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION>Meredith Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Metropolitan Home</ORGANIZATION>. 
And <PERSON>Tina Brown</PERSON>, editor of <ORGANIZATION>Conde Nast Publications Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Vanity Fair</ORGANIZATION>, said advertisers are frequently asked to take advertising positions in the back of her magazine to relieve ad clutter. "But advertisers wouldn't think of it," she said. 
<PERSON>Bernard Leser</PERSON>, president of <PERSON>Conde Nast</PERSON>, added: "Our research shows we sell more of our heavier issues . . . because readers believe they are getting more for what they pay for." 
Last month, <PERSON>Mr. Curcio</PERSON> was succeeded by <PERSON>Ralph E. Reins</PERSON> as chief executive officer following several quarters of lackluster or declining performance. 
The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> approved a short-term spending bill to keep the government operating through Nov. 15 and provide $2.85 billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo and the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> earthquake. 
The budget impact will be greater still in fiscal 1991, and the issue forced a confrontation between the <ORGANIZATION>Appropriations Committee</ORGANIZATION> leadership and <ORGANIZATION>Budget Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Leon Panetta</PERSON>, whose <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> district was at the center of the earthquake last week.
"We do not come to this House asking for any handout," said the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Democrat. "We do not intend to hide these costs from the <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> people." 
But the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> delegation finds itself asking that the cap per household be lifted to $500,000 from $100,000 to assist the hard hit but often wealthy <LOCATION>Marina</LOCATION> district. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> is expected to make some modifications today, but both the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> appear most anxious to speed final approval before tonight's deadline.
Administration pressure discourages any effort to add to total funding, and the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> changes are expected to be largely technical -- dealing with highway aid and lifting the ceiling on total <ORGANIZATION>Small Business Administration</ORGANIZATION> loans to $1.8 billion to accommodate the increased activity expected. 
Yesterday's floor action came as a <ORGANIZATION>House-Senate</ORGANIZATION> conference approved a nearly $8.5 billion fiscal 1990 military construction bill, representing a 5% reduction from last year and making severe cuts from <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> requests for installations abroad.
But all funding is cut for the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, and projects in <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> are cut to $13.6 million, or less than a sixth of the administration's request. 
An estimated $38.9 million was set aside for military installations in the home state of <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>W.G. Hefner</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> chairman.
And $70.2 million would go to projects in <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> represented by his <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> counterpart and fellow Democrat, <PERSON>Sen. James Sasser</PERSON>.
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> are traditionally powerful within the conference, but equally striking is the dominance of <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> because of their power elsewhere in the appropriations process.
<ORGANIZATION>Senate Appropriations Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Robert Byrd</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>W.Va.</LOCATION>) even added report language listing $49.4 million in projects he wants in the budget next year. 
No individual illustrated this mix of power more yesterday than <PERSON>Sen. Daniel Inouye</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>), who chairs the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> defense subcommittee.
But it gave ground to <PERSON>Mr. Inouye</PERSON> on a number of projects, ranging from a $11 million parking garage here, to a land transfer in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, to a provision to assist the <LOCATION>Makwah Indian Tribe</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> state.
<PERSON>Mr. Inouye</PERSON>, who chairs the select committee on Indian Affairs, used his power to move $400,000 from the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Indian Affairs</ORGANIZATION> to assist in renovating a decommissoned base to accommodate a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Construction</ORGANIZATION> spreads concrete throughout the country and boasts in international conferences that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s paved roadway per capita is the longest in the world, but they seldom think of the poor commuters who spend so much time sitting in traffic.
Money, such as in <LOCATION>Recruit</LOCATION>'s political donations, and women, as in the cases of Prime Minister <PERSON>Sosuke Uno</PERSON> and Secretary General <PERSON>Tokuo Yamashita</PERSON>, seldom have caused political scandals in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
In the recent <ORGANIZATION>Upper House</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> metropolitan congressional elections, in which the <ORGANIZATION>Socialist Party</ORGANIZATION> won a runaway victory, 60% of all women voted, as opposed to the usual 40%.
It's now OK to deal with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, but not the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
Against the rapid cosmetic overhaul of the <ORGANIZATION>Socialist Party</ORGANIZATION> the <ORGANIZATION>LDP</ORGANIZATION> has been paralyzed.
The <ORGANIZATION>LDP</ORGANIZATION> must make a decision immediately; <ORGANIZATION>Lower House</ORGANIZATION> elections must take place before June.
<PERSON>Mr. Ohmae</PERSON> is managing director of <ORGANIZATION>McKinsey & Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
"Teddy Z," which centers on a mailroom clerk-turned agent at a <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> talent agency, was scheduled in the coveted 9:30 p.m. slot to follow "<PERSON>Murphy Brown</PERSON>," a situation comedy about a television news magazine, starring <ORGANIZATION>Candice Bergen</ORGANIZATION>. "Teddy Z" was boosted by favorable reviews and a network-wide promotional tie-in contest with <ORGANIZATION>K mart Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
It was promoted on cable services, including <ORGANIZATION>MTV</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Nick</PERSON> at Night and VH-1, and premiered as the No. 22-rated show for the week. 
In figures released yesterday by <ORGANIZATION>A.C. Nielsen Co.</ORGANIZATION> "Teddy Z," produced by the television unit of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, was in 37th place.
Worse, every week it suffers audience drop-off from "<PERSON>Murphy Brown</PERSON>" and viewership on <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> picks up again once "Teddy Z" is over and is followed by "Designing Women." 
"There is strong indication that `Teddy Z' is not compatible with the shows it is surrounding," said <PERSON>John Sisk</PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION>J. Walter Thompson Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>WPP Group PLC</ORGANIZATION>. 
Creator <PERSON>Hugh Wilson</PERSON>, for example, included the lead character's <PERSON>Greek</PERSON> family in the cast, "but that is not the right focus anymore," said one <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> executive.
"We're making adjustments on the show, yes, but nothing radical," said <PERSON>Craig Nelson</PERSON>, the story consultant on "Teddy Z." "But we hope to keep a balance between the office and the family." The opening credits are being redone, <PERSON>Mr. Nelson</PERSON> said, "to make Teddy's situation clear to viewers who have not been with us since the beginning.
<ORGANIZATION>Apogee</ORGANIZATION> said a subcontractor had severe cost overruns and was unable to fulfill the contract terms on its own, making it necessary for <ORGANIZATION>Apogee</ORGANIZATION> to advance cash to ensure completion of the project. 
<ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Grosse Pointe Shores</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, estimated it will sell about as many cars in 1990 as the 75,000 it expects to deliver this year. 
<PERSON>Erich Krampe</PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales arm of West German auto maker <ORGANIZATION>Daimler Benz AG</ORGANIZATION>, predicted luxury-car sales will rise to 840,000 in 1990 from 830,000 this year primarily because of the new Japanese makes. 
<PERSON>Mr. Krampe</PERSON> also said that Mercedes plans to bring out new models every year through the mid-1990s and it will shorten its product development cycle to eight years from 10 or 12 years to compete more effectively with <ORGANIZATION>Toyota Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's Lexus, <ORGANIZATION>Nissan Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's Infiniti and <ORGANIZATION>Honda Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Acura</ORGANIZATION> luxury-car divisions. 
Last month, the <ORGANIZATION>General Accounting Office</ORGANIZATION> reported that defaults in <ORGANIZATION>Federal Housing Administration</ORGANIZATION> guarantees were five times as high as previously estimated, and that <ORGANIZATION>FHA</ORGANIZATION>'s equity fell to minus $2.9 billion.
<ORGANIZATION>GAO</ORGANIZATION>'s findings are particularly troubling because the <ORGANIZATION>FHA</ORGANIZATION> has about $300 billion in obligations outstanding and had previously been considered one of the most financially secure credit programs. 
If the programs continue their present path, the potential government losses are staggering: The federal government holds $222 billion in direct loans outstanding and backs an additional $550 billion in primary guarantees. (Secondary guarantees of pools of <ORGANIZATION>FHA</ORGANIZATION>- and VA-backed loans by the agency known as <ORGANIZATION>Ginnie Mae</ORGANIZATION> currently exceed $330 billion.) 
Some agencies simply keep bad loans on the books; as late as 1987, the <ORGANIZATION>Export-Import Bank</ORGANIZATION> held in its portfolio at face value loans made to <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> in the 1950s.
Until <ORGANIZATION>GAO</ORGANIZATION>'s recent audit, <ORGANIZATION>FHA</ORGANIZATION> books had not been subject to a complete external audit in 15 years.

In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Cray</ORGANIZATION> closed down $1.125 at $34.25. 
Next year "looks dismal," said analyst <PERSON>Paul Luber</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Robert Baird & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Milwaukee</ORGANIZATION>.
Noting that <ORGANIZATION>Cray</ORGANIZATION> doesn't have a low-end supercomputer to compete with the likes of <ORGANIZATION>Convex Computer Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Luber</PERSON> said such a machine would be necessary "to get things back on line here." <ORGANIZATION>Cray</ORGANIZATION> has indicated it will decide on whether to build such a machine before year end. 
<PERSON>Judge Robert</PERSON> ("Maximum Bob") <PERSON>Potter</PERSON> sentenced <PERSON>Jim Bakker</PERSON> to 45 years in the big house yesterday, while a <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION> judge tucked away <PERSON>Zsa Zsa Gabor</PERSON> for three days, plus 120 hours of work with homeless women.
The decline surprised analysts and jolted <ORGANIZATION>HomeFed</ORGANIZATION>'s stock, which lost 8.6% of its value, closing at $38.50 on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, down $3.625. 
<ORGANIZATION>HomeFed</ORGANIZATION> had been one of the handful of large <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> thrifts that in recent quarters had counteracted interest-rate problems dogging the industry by keeping a lid on problem assets and lending heavily into the furious <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> housing market.
<ORGANIZATION>HomeFed</ORGANIZATION> said the slide in loan originations was more a matter of design than a sign of cooling in the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> market.
Any such downturn in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> would be grim news for <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> thrifts, particularly the less healthy ones, which have performed poorly even with a torrid market.
The talk of a sales tax rise follows a rebuff from <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> on the question of how much the federal government is willing to spend to aid in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s earthquake relief efforts.
The state had sought as much as $4.1 billion in relief, but yesterday the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> approved a more general scaled-back measure calling for $2.85 billion in aid, the bulk of which would go to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, with an unspecified amount going to regions affected by Hurricane Hugo. 
<PERSON>Willie Brown</PERSON>, speaker of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Assembly</ORGANIZATION>, said that Gov. <PERSON>George Deukmejian</PERSON> has agreed to schedule a special session of the legislature within two weeks. 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s so-called <PERSON>Gann</PERSON> limit effectively prevents the state from spending new tax money and so drastically limits its options in an emergency. 
<PERSON>Mr. Brown</PERSON>, meanwhile, believes "only one tax will be feasible, and it will be a one-penny sales tax increase," said <PERSON>Chuck Dalldorf</PERSON>, an aide. 
Moreover, an aide to <PERSON>Mr. Brown</PERSON> said Gov. <PERSON>Deukmejian</PERSON> "has expressed a desire not to spend all the reserve on this." 
And then it will be required to lower taxes by a corresponding amount during a three-year period after the temporary tax increase ends, said <PERSON>Cindy Katz</PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION>state department of finance</ORGANIZATION>. 
But observers expect broad support. "If there's an emergency and there aren't sufficient funds from elsewhere, I think the attitude will be supportive," said <PERSON>Kirk West</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>California Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>. 
Not everyone is convinced the state must raise new revenue to meet its earthquake needs. "It's possible, though not probable," that the state could get by with its existing resources and federal help, said <PERSON>Quentin Kopp</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>state senate</ORGANIZATION>'s transportation committee. 
The claims, which were filed with the <ORGANIZATION>State Board of Control</ORGANIZATION> but will probably end up in court, are the first arising out of the collapse of the so-called <ORGANIZATION>Cypress</ORGANIZATION> structure viaduct. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>Xerox</ORGANIZATION> closed at $62.75 a share, up $1. 
Sales growth and profit in business products and systems -- <ORGANIZATION>Xerox</ORGANIZATION>'s main business -- were "disappointing," said <PERSON>B. Alex Henderson</PERSON>, who follows the company for <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
Sales of <ORGANIZATION>Xerox</ORGANIZATION> copiers and other office products grew 1.6%; "we expected growth of 6% to 7%," <PERSON>Mr. Henderson</PERSON> said.
Still, with competitors such as <ORGANIZATION>Eastman Kodak Co.</ORGANIZATION> faltering in copier sales, <ORGANIZATION>Xerox</ORGANIZATION>'s sales increases "were encouraging," says <PERSON>Eugene Glazer</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "They are holding their own in a weak market, and the restructuring is working," he says. 
<PERSON>David T. Kearns</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Xerox</ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer, cited the restructuring and "strong" cost controls for the 13% growth in profit from business products and systems operations. 
<PERSON>Mr. Glazer</PERSON> expects <ORGANIZATION>Xerox</ORGANIZATION> to experience tough sledding, though, in financial services because of rate pressures and uncertainty surrounding tax treatment of capital gains. 
"Because of shrinkage in the economy, rates can be expected to decline over a one-year horizon," said <PERSON>Norberto Mehl</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Banxquote</ORGANIZATION>. "It's unclear how much rates can fall and how soon." 
"The (CD) market is unsettled right now," said <ORGANIZATION>Banxquote</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Mehl</PERSON>. "It's very easily influenced by changes in the stock market and the junk bond market." 
At <LOCATION>Chase Manhattan Bank</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, for example, the yield on a small denomination six-month CD fell about a quarter of a percentage point to 8.06%.
In <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Bank of America</ORGANIZATION> dropped the yield on both six-month and one-year "savings" CDs to 8.33% from 8.61%. 
A spokesman for <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> says <LOCATION>Hugo</LOCATION> hasn't prompted proposals for state or local increases.
If the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> admits its error and the charges have been paid, it will reimburse a taxpayer who hasn't refused to give timely answers to <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> inquiries or hasn't contributed to continuing or compounding the error.
The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> recently amended the policy to cover stop-payment charges for checks lost by the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>. 
If the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> seeks late-payment interest because of the lost check, you should request interest abatement, publisher <PERSON>Prentice Hall</PERSON> notes. 
Thus, the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> says, the <ORGANIZATION>Blandings</ORGANIZATION>' $200,000 loan is home-acquisition debt, and interest on it is fully deductible. 
EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS facing imminent filing and payment deadlines will get extensions and penalty waivers like those provided for <LOCATION>Hugo</LOCATION>'s victims; <ORGANIZATION>IRS Notice</ORGANIZATION> 89108 has details.
The <ORGANIZATION>General Accounting Office</ORGANIZATION> estimates that 50% of <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> audits don't spot companies that fail to file the reports. 
UH HUH: A claim by <PERSON>Peter Testa</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> that a stranger paid him $500 to go into a bank and change $44,400 in small bills into large bills "is unconvincing," the <ORGANIZATION>Tax Court</ORGANIZATION> found.
The rule goes back at least as far as a 1930 <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> decision, <PERSON>Robert Willens</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton</ORGANIZATION> says.
BRIEFS: Ways and Means veteran <PERSON>Gephardt</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>) moves to the <ORGANIZATION>House Budget Committee</ORGANIZATION>; Rep. <PERSON>Cardin</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>) replaces him. . . . <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>'s license fees for adult peep shows vary from those for other coin-operated amusements without serving a substantial government interest and are unconstitutional, the ninth-circuit appeals court holds for <ORGANIZATION>Acorn Investments Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> is in the process of trying to gain control over a law that federal <PERSON>Judge David Sentelle</PERSON> recently called a "monster." Needless to say, he was talking about <ORGANIZATION>RICO</ORGANIZATION>.
With its recently revised guidelines for <ORGANIZATION>RICO</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Justice</ORGANIZATION> makes it clear that the law currently holds too many incentives for abuse by prosecutors. 
They strongly suggest that <ORGANIZATION>Justice</ORGANIZATION>'s prosecutions of <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Michael Milken</PERSON> and Princeton/Newport violated notions of fundamental fairness.
This amounts to an extraordinary repudiation of the tenure of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> mayoral candidate and former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON>Rudolph Giuliani</PERSON>, who was more inclined to gathering scalps than understanding markets. 
Princeton/Newport investors, including <ORGANIZATION>McKinsey & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> endowment, made the rational decision to withdraw their money; for the firm, the liquidation was sentence first, verdict later.
The experience of <ORGANIZATION>Princeton/Newport</ORGANIZATION> and initiation of other RICO-forfeiture cases against legitimate businesses taught <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> that a RICOed investment bank would be an ex-investment bank.
<ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> therefore agreed instead to an arrangement allowing it to plea to charges "which the company is not in a position to dispute" because of <ORGANIZATION>RICO</ORGANIZATION>. Part of <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION>'s plea was to cut <PERSON>Mr. Milken</PERSON> loose.
Justice has finally recognized its employees' abuses, thanks largely to the demands for reform by former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> <PERSON>Joseph diGenova</PERSON>, who wants to salvage <ORGANIZATION>RICO</ORGANIZATION> for real criminals. 
<PERSON>Judge Sentelle</PERSON>, of the appeals court in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, made this point at a <ORGANIZATION>Cato Institute</ORGANIZATION> conference last week in a remarkable speech titled, "RICO: The Monster That Ate Jurisprudence." He said ours is supposed to be "a government of laws not of men," and yet <ORGANIZATION>RICO</ORGANIZATION> defenders "tell us that we should rely on prosecutorial discretion to protect against overbreadth of <ORGANIZATION>RICO</ORGANIZATION>." No prosecutorial guidelines, observed or unobserved, limit civil <ORGANIZATION>RICO</ORGANIZATION> cases by plaintiffs for damages. 
What now for <ORGANIZATION>Princeton/Newport</ORGANIZATION> officials, <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Mr. Milken</PERSON>?
We suspect that <ORGANIZATION>Justice</ORGANIZATION> will some day agree that only the complete repeal of <ORGANIZATION>RICO</ORGANIZATION> can guarantee an end to injustices in its name. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Federal Housing Administration</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Veterans Administration</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Housing and Urban Development</ORGANIZATION> further aggravate the problem of affordable housing stock by "buying in" to their foreclosed properties (of which there are, alas, many) at an inflated "balance due" -- say $80,000 on a house worth $55,000 -- instead of allowing a free market to price the house for what it's really worth. 
Much of the recent slide in <ORGANIZATION>Dun & Bradstreet</ORGANIZATION>'s stock came late last week, after negative comments by analysts at <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
One of <ORGANIZATION>Dun & Bradstreet</ORGANIZATION>'s chief businesses is compiling reports that rate the credit-worthiness of millions of <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> companies.
It also owns <ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service</ORGANIZATION>, which assigns credit-ratings to bonds and preferred stock; <ORGANIZATION>A.C. Nielsen</ORGANIZATION>, known for its data on television-viewing patterns, and Yellow-pages publisher <PERSON>Donnelley</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>John C. Holt</PERSON>, an executive vice president and <ORGANIZATION>Dun & Bradstreet</ORGANIZATION> director, sold 10,000 shares on Aug. 31 for $588,800, filings show.
Last Thursday, <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION> securities analyst <PERSON>Peter Falco</PERSON> downgraded his investment rating on the firm, according to Dow Jones Professional Investors Report, citing a slowdown in the credit-reporting business.
The stock received another blow on Friday, when <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs</ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON>Eric Philo</PERSON> advised that investors with short-term horizons should avoid <ORGANIZATION>Dun & Bradstreet</ORGANIZATION> stock because it is unlikely to outperform the market.
Insider selling is not unusual at <ORGANIZATION>Dun & Bradstreet</ORGANIZATION>; in fact, the recent pace of selling is just about average for the company, according to figures compiled by <ORGANIZATION>Invest/Net</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>North Miami</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, firm that specializes in tracking and analyzing <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> insider filings. 
But previous sales have often been sales of shares purchased through the exercise of stock options and sold six months later, as soon as allowed, said <PERSON>Robert Gabele</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Invest/Net</ORGANIZATION>.
TASTY PROFITS: <PERSON>Michael A. Miles</PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris Cos.</ORGANIZATION> ' <ORGANIZATION>Kraft General Foods</ORGANIZATION> unit, bought 6,000 shares of the company on Sept. 22 for $157 each.
<PERSON>Mr. Miles</PERSON>'s newly purchased shares are now worth $1,068,000, based on <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris</ORGANIZATION>'s closing price of $44.50, up 62.5 cents, in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> yesterday. 
A spokesman for <PERSON>Mr. Miles</PERSON> said he bought the shares because he felt they were "a good investment." The executive made his purchases shortly before being named to his current chief executive officer's position; formerly he was <ORGANIZATION>Kraft General Foods</ORGANIZATION>' chief operating officer. 
SHEDDING GLITTER: Two directors of <ORGANIZATION>Pegasus Gold Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Spokane</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, precious-metals mining firm, sold most of their holdings in the company Aug. 31.
On Wall Street, <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION> analyst <ORGANIZATION>Daniel A. Roling</ORGANIZATION> rates the stock "neutral" and <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION> lists it as a "buy." <ORGANIZATION>Pegasus Gold</ORGANIZATION> "has been on a lot of recommended lists as a junior growth company stepping into the big leagues," says <PERSON>Marty McNeill</PERSON>, metals analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Dominick & Dominick</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investment firm. "It's a good company, and growing; there's nothing that would warrant that it be sold." 
Yesterday, in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Pegasus</ORGANIZATION> closed at $10.125, up 12.5 cents. 
<PERSON>Richard W. Lock</PERSON>, retired vice president and treasurer of <ORGANIZATION>Owens-Illinois Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, was named a director of this transportation industry supplier, increasing its board to six members. 
<PERSON>Honeywell</PERSON> said a second sale of <ORGANIZATION>Yamatake-Honeywell</ORGANIZATION> is still being negotiated.
A 20% stake would allow <ORGANIZATION>Honeywell</ORGANIZATION> to include <ORGANIZATION>Yamatake</ORGANIZATION> earnings in its results. 
Star lecturer at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION>, author of numerous popular books on science, and scourge of the creationist lobby, <PERSON>Mr. Gould</PERSON> is perhaps the world's most eminent evolutionary theorist.
In "Wonderful Life: The <PERSON>Burgess Shale</PERSON> and the Nature of History" (<ORGANIZATION>Norton</ORGANIZATION>, 326 pages, $19.95), <PERSON>Mr. Gould</PERSON> makes his case for "the awesome improbability of human evolution." The argument turns on the discovery in 1909 of an amazing fossil quarry high in the Canadian Rockies called the <ORGANIZATION>Burgess Shale</ORGANIZATION>.
Such an embarrassment of riches was inconceivable to the man who discovered the <PERSON>Burgess Shale</PERSON>, one <PERSON>Charles Doolittle Walcott</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Harry Whittington</PERSON> and two sharp graduate students began to publish a reinterpretation of the <ORGANIZATION>Burgess Shale</ORGANIZATION>.
Back when the <LOCATION>Burgess</LOCATION> fauna were flourishing, it seems, human evolutionary hopes hung on the survival of a little worm with a backbone called <LOCATION>Pikaia</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Gould</PERSON> finds this oddly exhilarating; like an existentialist of old, he views our contingency as "a source of both freedom and consequent moral responsibility." I, by contrast, cannot help feeling that if some other curiosity from the <PERSON>Burgess Shale</PERSON> had survived instead, beings at once wiser and less boorish than Homo sapiens might have eventually gained earthly dominion.

When the <ORGANIZATION>Trinity Repertory Theater</ORGANIZATION> named <PERSON>Anne Bogart</PERSON> its artistic director last spring, the nation's theatrical cognoscenti arched a collective eyebrow.
<PERSON>Ms. Bogart</PERSON>, an acclaimed creator of deconstructed dramatic collages that tear into such sacred texts as <ORGANIZATION>Rodgers</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Hammerstein</PERSON>'s "South Pacific," is decidedly downtown.
Now, with the opening of <PERSON>Maxim Gorky</PERSON>'s bourgeois-bashing "Summerfolk," <PERSON>Ms. Bogart</PERSON> has laid her cards on the table.
For <PERSON>Ms. Bogart</PERSON>, who initially studied and directed in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> (and cites such <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> directors as <PERSON>Peter Stein</PERSON>, <PERSON>Giorgio Strehler</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ariane Mnouchkine</PERSON> as influences) tends to stage her productions with a Brechtian rigor -- whether the text demands it or not.
<PERSON>Gorky</PERSON> was a loyal if occasionally ambivalent proletarian writer committed to enlightening the masses with plain speaking rooted in a slightly sour version of <LOCATION>Chekhovian</LOCATION> humanism.
And "Summerfolk," penned in 1904 as a kind of sequel to <PERSON>Chekhov</PERSON>'s "Cherry Orchard," is a lawn party of <LOCATION>Russian</LOCATION> yuppies engaged in an exhausting ideological fight to the finish between the allrightniks and the reformers.
Wisely <PERSON>Ms. Bogart</PERSON> has kept <PERSON>Gorky</PERSON>'s time and place intact.
But beyond this decorative nod to tradition, <PERSON>Ms. Bogart</PERSON> and company head off in a stylistic direction that all but transforms <PERSON>Gorky</PERSON>'s naturalistic drama into something akin to, well, farce.
Like <PERSON>Peter Sellars</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ms. Bogart</PERSON> manipulates her actors as if they were rag dolls, sprawling them on staircases, dangling them off tables, even hanging them from precipices while having them perform some gymnastic feats of derring-do.
There are moments in this "Summerfolk" when the characters populating the vast multilevel country house (which looks like a parody of <PERSON>Frank Lloyd Wright</PERSON> and is designed by <PERSON>Victoria Petrovich</PERSON>) spout philosophic bon mots with the self-conscious rat-a-tat-tat pacing of "Laugh In." "Talk hurts from where it spurts," one of them says.
<PERSON>Ms. Bogart</PERSON> does better with music than with words when she wants, as she so often does want, to express herself through <PERSON>Gorky</PERSON>'s helpless play.
Here she has the aid of her longtime associate <PERSON>Jeff Helpern</PERSON>, whom she appointed <ORGANIZATION>Trinity</ORGANIZATION>'s first-ever musical director and whom she equipped with a spanking new $60,000 sound system and recording studio.
For <PERSON>Gorky</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Helpern</PERSON> provided an aural collage of <ORGANIZATION>Debussy</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Rachmaninoff</PERSON>, which is less a score than a separate character with a distinct point of view. 
Like Brecht, and indeed <PERSON>Ezra Pound</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ms. Bogart</PERSON> has said that her intent in such manipulative staging of the classics is simply an attempt to "make it new." Indeed, during a recent post-production audience discussion, the director explained that her fondest artistic wish was to find a way to play "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" so that the song's "original beauty comes through," surmounting the cliche.
<PERSON>Ed Shea</PERSON> and <PERSON>Barbara Orson</PERSON> never find a real reason for their love affair as the foolish, idealistic young <PERSON>Vass</PERSON> and the tirelessly humanitarian doctor <LOCATION>Maria Lvovna</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Cynthia Strickland</LOCATION> as the long-suffering <ORGANIZATION>Varvara</ORGANIZATION> is a tiresome whiner, not the inspirational counterrevolutionary <PERSON>Gorky</PERSON> intended.
<ORGANIZATION>Janice Duclos</ORGANIZATION>, in addition to possessing one of the evening's more impressive vocal instruments, brings an unsuspected comedic touch to her role of <PERSON>Olga</PERSON>, everybody's favorite mom.
But it is the Trinity Rep newcomer, <PERSON>Jonathan Fried</PERSON> (<PERSON>Zamislov</PERSON>, the paralegal) who is the actor to watch, whether he is hamming it up while conducting the chamber musicians or seducing his neighbor's wife (<PERSON>Becca Lish</PERSON>) by licking her bosom. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Federal Trade Commission</ORGANIZATION> said it authorized its staff to seek a preliminary injunction barring <ORGANIZATION>Imo Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> from acquiring the shares outstanding of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unit of the British company, <ORGANIZATION>United Scientific Holdings PLC</ORGANIZATION>, for $69 million. 
Officials at the <ORGANIZATION>United Scientific</ORGANIZATION> unit, <ORGANIZATION>Optic-Electronic Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Garland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, and at <ORGANIZATION>Imo Industries</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Lawrenceville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, couldn't be reached for comment. 
Airlines in 1989 "came in like a bang and are going out like a whimper," said <PERSON>Kevin Murphy</PERSON>, an airline analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
Just last week, for example, <ORGANIZATION>Trans World Airlines</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Pan American World Airways</ORGANIZATION> went so far as to offer cash rebates or gift checks of $200 to $1,000 to certain frequent-flier members making trans-Atlantic flights in business class or first class.
The industry's slowdown became apparent this month when <ORGANIZATION>AMR Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, reported an 8.8% drop in third-quarter net income and said its fourth quarter would be "disappointing." Shortly before that, <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> had said its third-quarter results would be "significantly lower" than a year earlier.
For the nine months, the <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, company's net plunged 73% to $38.5 million, or 76 cents a share, from $142.2 million, or $3.28 a share.
The results surprised many analysts, because <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> has almost no competition in its <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> hub and has expanded operations by completing its acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Piedmont Airlines</ORGANIZATION>.
"Nobody was expecting this size of a loss," said <PERSON>Paul Karos</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
And some carriers are facing other unexpected headaches: <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION>, for example, blamed some of its loss on merger expenses and on disruptions caused by Hurricane Hugo last month. "We cannot quantify the total adverse effects of Hugo," said <PERSON>Edwin Colodny</PERSON>, chairman and president of <ORGANIZATION>USAir Group</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> executives and lawyers provided "misleading and false" information to the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> in 1985 in an effort to cover up "longstanding fraudulent" billing practices, federal prosecutors alleged in legal briefs. 
The case strikes at the corporate image of GE, which provides the military with everything from jet engines and electronic warfare equipment to highly classified design work on the <ORGANIZATION>Strategic Defense Initiative</ORGANIZATION>, and could cause a loss of future defense contracts if Pentagon and <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> officials take a tough stance. 
GE pleaded guilty and paid a fine of more than $1 million in the <LOCATION>Minuteman</LOCATION> case, which involved some of the same individuals and operations that are at the center of the dispute in the <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> court. 
In order to show that all of its units had corrected billing problems and therefore should become eligible again for new contracts, prosecutors contend that "high-level GE executives" and company lawyers provided "misleading statements" to then-Air Force Secretary <PERSON>Verne Orr</PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> officials during a series of meetings in 1985. 
When GE finally disclosed the problems, prosecutors contend that <PERSON>Mr. Orr</PERSON> "was erroneously informed that the {suspected} practices had only just been discovered" by <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION> management. 
The investment will be made through <ORGANIZATION>IBM Australia Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>, the two companies said yesterday. 
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> can raise its stake in <LOCATION>Paxus</LOCATION> to 20% over three years, but agreed to not go beyond 20% in that time. 
<ORGANIZATION>Paxus</ORGANIZATION> said in a statement it has several "well developed product and services relationships" with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> computer company, and plans to expand these links.
A majority stake in <LOCATION>Paxus</LOCATION> currently held by <ORGANIZATION>NZI Corp.</ORGANIZATION> will be diluted to slightly less than 50% after <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> acquires its interest. 
The agreement requires approval from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Investment Review Board and National Companies and Securities Commission</ORGANIZATION>, and from shareholders of <LOCATION>Paxus</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Applied Solar Energy Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>City of Industry</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, said it and its majority shareholder, <ORGANIZATION>American Cyanamid Co.</ORGANIZATION>, signed a non-binding letter of intent for the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Applied Solar</ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas Corp.</ORGANIZATION> for about $38 million. 
American <PERSON>Cyanamid</PERSON> is a <LOCATION>Wayne</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, chemicals, drugs and fertilizer concern. 
A spokeswoman for the <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> aerospace and defense concern said it wanted the acquistion because Applied Solar is involved in solar cells and solid-state laser components, and this fits with <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION>'s business of laser applications for military space. 
"The earnings were fine and above expectations," said <PERSON>Michael W. Blumstein</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Nevertheless, <ORGANIZATION>Salomon</ORGANIZATION>'s stock fell $1.125 yesterday to close at $23.25 a share in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading. "I suspect October wasn't as good as the third quarter, and they'll have difficulty matching the third quarter in the fourth quarter," <PERSON>Mr. Blumstein</PERSON> said. 
But some analysts say <ORGANIZATION>Salomon</ORGANIZATION> has turned the corner. "I upgraded the firm to my buy list because I certainly see signs of improvement," says <PERSON>Lawrence Eckenfelder</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities</ORGANIZATION>. "The market has been overly harsh to them." 
Earnings at the consumer-products giant were boosted by a gain of $125 million, or about 25 cents a share, stemming from last month's settlement of litigation with three of <ORGANIZATION>P&G</ORGANIZATION>'s competitors over patents on <ORGANIZATION>P&G</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Duncan Hines</PERSON> cookies. 
Unit volume, or amount of products shipped, rose about 11% in the international segment, with <ORGANIZATION>P&G</ORGANIZATION> continuing to win market share in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s diaper and detergent markets.
<PERSON>Jay Freedman</PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Kidder, Peabody & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>P&G</ORGANIZATION>'s Always sanitary napkin, sold under the Whisper name in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, has firmly established itself as a leading brand.
<ORGANIZATION>P&G</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> shipments were up just 1%, partly because the company decided to shift more promotions and sales for health and beauty products to the fiscal second quarter.
<PERSON>Hugh Zurkuhlen</PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Bros.</ORGANIZATION>, predicts the shift will mean P&G's sales growth in the second quarter will be "in the double digits." 
Also slowing growth in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> were lackluster results for <ORGANIZATION>P&G</ORGANIZATION>'s cooking oils, which had a strong year-earlier first quarter.
Last year's drought in the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> prompted retailers to stock up on oils ahead of anticipated price increases, boosting sales for <ORGANIZATION>Crisco</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Puritan</LOCATION> oils, analysts said. 
<PERSON>Lynne Hyman</PERSON>, vice president of equity research for <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, expects P&G to post net of about $4.20 a share, on a post-split basis. "But I'm recognizing there's a good chance they'll do a bit better than that," she says.
Concern about the volatile <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stock market had faded in recent sessions, and traders appeared content to let the dollar languish in a narrow range until tomorrow, when the preliminary report on third-quarter <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> gross national product is released. 
They added that the <ORGANIZATION>DJIA</ORGANIZATION>'s swift drop proved an easy excuse for the market to drive the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> currency in the direction it was already headed. 
In <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Wednesday, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> currency opened for trading at 141.57 yen, down from Tuesday's <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> close of 142.10 yen. 
<PERSON>Tom Trettien</PERSON>, a vice president with <ORGANIZATION>Banque Paribas</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, sees a break in the dollar's long-term upward trend, a trend that began in January 1988. 
Analysts peg the dollar's recent weakness to an underlying slowdown in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economy, highlighted by recent economic data, particularly a surprisingly sharp widening in the August <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade gap. 
They also point out that narrowing interest-rate differentials between the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and its major trading partners tend to make the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> currency less attractive to foreign investors. 
Some dealers say that <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Japan</ORGANIZATION> Governor <PERSON>Satoshi Sumita</PERSON>'s reassurance that Japanese monetary policy won't be changed for the time being has given investors an added excuse to push the yen down even further against the mark. 
Despite the yen's weakness with respect to the mark, <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> traders say they don't expect the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Japan</ORGANIZATION> to take any action to support the Japanese currency on that front. 
On the <ORGANIZATION>Commodity Exchange</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, gold for current delivery jumped $3.20 to $370.20 an ounce.
Nevertheless, on <LOCATION>Capitol Hill</LOCATION>, where the information was released yesterday at a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> banking subcommittee hearing, lawmakers said they are worried that financial institutions are routinely discriminating against minorities.
<PERSON>Sen. Alan Dixon</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>D</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>), chairman of the subcommittee on consumer and regulatory affairs, said, "I'm not a statistician.
<PERSON>James Grohl</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. League of Savings Institutions</ORGANIZATION>, said, "The data is a red flag, but lacking the financial data you can't make a case that discrimination is widespread." The trade group official added: "Certainly the federal government should take a hard look at it." 
But <PERSON>John LaWare</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> governor, told the subcommittee the evidence is mixed and that the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>'s believes the vast majority of banks aren't discriminating.
Several lawmakers were angered that the bank and thrift regulators generally said they have been too busy handling the record number of bank and thrift failures in the past few years to put much energy into investigating possible discrimination. "We would be the first to admit that we have not devoted the necessary amount of emphasis over the past several years" to developing examinations for discrimination, said <PERSON>Jonathan Fiechter</PERSON>, a top official of the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Thrift Supervision</ORGANIZATION>. 
"If we've got folks out there who are being turned away in the mortgage market improperly and unfairly," said <PERSON>Sen. Donald Riegle</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>), chairman of the banking committee, "then that is a matter that needs remedy now, not six months from now, or six years from now, or 26 years from now." 
Using testers could be controversial with financial institutions, but <PERSON>Mr. Grohl</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. League of Savings Institutions</ORGANIZATION> hadn't yet taken any position on the matter. 
<ORGANIZATION>Westinghouse Electric Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it will buy <ORGANIZATION>Shaw-Walker Co</ORGANIZATION>. Terms weren't disclosed. 
Shaw-Walker, based in <LOCATION>Muskegon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, makes metal files and desks, and seating and office systems furniture. 
When the good fairy assigned to <LOCATION>Slovakia</LOCATION> hovered over the cradle of <PERSON>Edita Gruberova</PERSON> many years ago in <LOCATION>Bratislava</LOCATION>, she sprinkled her with high E flats, sparkling Ds, clean trills, and coloratura ornaments silvery as magic dust.
Cast as <PERSON>Violetta Valery</PERSON> in a new production of <LOCATION>Verdi</LOCATION>'s "La Traviata," <PERSON>Ms. Gruberova</PERSON> last week did many things nicely and others not so well.
But this is a production designed and directed by <PERSON>Franco Zeffirelli</PERSON> and paid for by <PERSON>Sybil Harrington</PERSON>, who has no need to count her pennies, unlike <LOCATION>Violetta</LOCATION>, down to 20 louis at the opera's end.
Maybe <PERSON>Mr. Z.</PERSON> was too busy taming his set to work with his naturally ungainly <PERSON>Alfredo</PERSON>.
This is the same production already seen in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION>, and its scenic ideas echo the movie he made with <PERSON>Placido Domingo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Teresa Stratas</PERSON>.
Decades earlier, <LOCATION>Maria Callas</LOCATION> sang the <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> staging that introduced the flashback idea.
In an invention that drives <LOCATION>Verdi</LOCATION> purists bananas, <PERSON>Violetta</PERSON> lies dying in bed during the prelude, rising deliriously when then she remembers the great parties she used to throw.
In any event, <PERSON>Ms. Gruberova</PERSON> barely ventilated <PERSON>Violetta</PERSON>'s anguish in her long meeting with <PERSON>Wolfgang Brendel</PERSON>, who as Germont seemed fairly desperate trying to inject an Italianate lilt into his heavy, teutonic baritone. "Di Provenza" wasn't much of an advertisement for sunny, southern <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
Perhaps <PERSON>Mr. Kleiber</PERSON> could let him substitute one of the songs about dead children and dark nights from <PERSON>Mahler</PERSON>'s "Kindertotenlieder." 
Speaking of dark nights, the Met's next-door neighbor, the <LOCATION>New York City Opera</LOCATION>, has canceled its season after failing to reach a settlement with its musicians, who wanted pay parity with the the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Lyric</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>San Francisco Opera</LOCATION> orchestras.
The cancellation bodes poorly for a company already beset with an identity crisis exacerbated by the retirement of general director <PERSON>Beverly Sills</PERSON> and the amazing appointment of <PERSON>Christopher Keene</PERSON> as her successor after his years of feckless toiling in the pit.
I, for instance, was perfectly happy at Avery Fisher Hall the other day listening to <PERSON>Helmuth Rilling</PERSON> conduct the <ORGANIZATION>Messa</ORGANIZATION> per <PERSON>Rossini</PERSON>, a strange piece written by 13 different Italian composers to honor <PERSON>Rossini</PERSON> after his death in 1868.
We know <LOCATION>Verdi</LOCATION>'s own contribution was mighty impressive since the operatic "Libera me" was reworked for the <ORGANIZATION>Manzoni Requiem</ORGANIZATION>, of which he wrote every note himself having learned his lesson.
Also, <PERSON>Teodulo Mabellini</PERSON>'s "Lux aeterna" was intriguingly scored and splendidly put across by <PERSON>Mr. Rilling</PERSON>.
He brought along his Stuttgart-based <PERSON>Gaechinger Kantorei</PERSON> chorus, and even better, the <LOCATION>Czech</LOCATION> soprano <PERSON>Gabriela Benackova</PERSON>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Tokyo International Film Festival</ORGANIZATION> was no match for the <ORGANIZATION>Cannes Film Festival</ORGANIZATION> in terms of prestige, but it made its mark: It awarded the largest cash prize of any film festival to young and first-time film makers. 
At this year's event, the third since the festival got under way in 1985, <PERSON>Idrissa Ouedraogo</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Burkina Faso</LOCATION> won the <ORGANIZATION>Sakura Gold</ORGANIZATION> prize of $143,000 for "Yaaba" ("Old Woman").
Says director <PERSON>George Miller</PERSON> ("Mad Max"): "I think the <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> festival may become known as a major attraction for young directors because of the money as well as the recognition." 
<PERSON>Vincent Tolentino</PERSON>, a correspondent for the French magazine <ORGANIZATION>Telerama</ORGANIZATION>, says of the recently ended <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> festival: "No one makes deals . . . and most of the films have been seen before at other festivals." 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> is considering giving aid to <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> to support their recent political reforms, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> said. "This is the first time, if we decide to do so, for <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to extend aid of this kind to Eastern European countries," the spokesman said.
He said Prime Minister <PERSON>Toshiki Kaifu</PERSON> also is studying the possibility of a visit to the two Eastern bloc nations and to <LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION> next January. 
Drugs were a major issue in two days of talks between French President <PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Spanish</LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON>Felipe Gonzalez</PERSON>. "I demand the utmost severity in the fight against drug traffickers," President <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> said after the meeting in <LOCATION>Valladolid</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>.
He added: "Banks must open their books." The leaders' talks coincided with a meeting in <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> of anti-drug experts from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Bolivia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>.
Three Soviet government officials -- the ministers of railroads, of foreign economic relations and of heavy-machine building -- will visit <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> next month for talks, <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s official news agency reported.
And in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mahmoud Vaezi</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s vice minister of foreign affairs, began a five-day visit to discuss such matters as compensation to French enterprises for contracts broken by the <LOCATION>Khomeini</LOCATION> regime. 
<ORGANIZATION>Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Omron Tateisi Electronics</ORGANIZATION> are involved with <ORGANIZATION>Toto</ORGANIZATION>'s new product, which will go on the market in about two years time. "It will be very expensive," the spokesman warned. "The price cannot be less than $7,000." 
<PERSON>Hector Castaneda Jimenez</PERSON>, chief prosecutor at the <ORGANIZATION>Attorney General's Office</ORGANIZATION>, said that an estimated $82.8 million in government property and unpaid taxes have been recovered in the campaign to root out official corruption. 
The <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>, which is distributing farm tools to returning refugees in <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>, is rethinking a plan to hand out machetes because of the tense political climate during preparations for independence from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. "The decision to distribute machetes at this time, which could be used as weapons, is under review," said a <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> spokesman. . . . Sources close to the family of Pakistani Prime Minister <PERSON>Benazir Bhutto</PERSON> said she is expecting a second child, probably early next year. 
But now, <PERSON>Charlie Brown</PERSON> is about to start pitching everything from <ORGANIZATION>Chex Party Mix</ORGANIZATION> to light bulbs.
Turns out that next year, <PERSON>Charlie Brown</PERSON>, Snoopy and the gang turn 40 -- and <ORGANIZATION>Scripps Howard's United Media</ORGANIZATION> unit, the syndicator and licensing agent for <PERSON>Charles Schulz</PERSON>'s comic strip, sees a bonanza in licensing the cartoon characters to a bevy of advertisers for ads, tie-ins and promotions. 
"Peanuts has become a major part of <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> culture," says <PERSON>Peter Shore</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>United Media</ORGANIZATION>'s vice president of marketing and licensing.
<ORGANIZATION>Teleflora</ORGANIZATION> will run TV ads at <ORGANIZATION>Valentine</ORGANIZATION>'s Day promoting its "Snoopy's Love Bouquet." <ORGANIZATION>Ralston Purina</ORGANIZATION> will promote its <ORGANIZATION>Chex Party Mix</ORGANIZATION>'s three new flavor packets named for <PERSON>Charlie Brown</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Linus</LOCATION>.
Beyond the advertisements, the syndicator is planning a traveling arena show, new TV specials for <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> and even an exhibit at the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian Institute</ORGANIZATION>.
All the tie-ins, though, have some marketing experts questioning whether the party may go too far. "There are too many people participating," says <PERSON>Al Ries</PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION>Trout & Ries</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Greenwich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, marketing consulting firm. "If you want to cut through the clutter, you have to make your message as distinct, sharp and individual as possible.
But <ORGANIZATION>United Media</ORGANIZATION> says it's very scrupulous with the contracts it hands out. "We're not interested in promoting every single product that comes along," <PERSON>Mr. Shore</PERSON> says. 
<PERSON>Norman Berry</PERSON>, the creative executive who was apparently squeezed out of <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy & Mather</ORGANIZATION> in June, is returning to <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy</ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION>WPP Group PLC</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Berry</PERSON>, 58, had resigned after being asked by <PERSON>Ogilvy</PERSON> 's chairman and chief executive officer, <PERSON>Kenneth Roman</PERSON>, to give up his title as creative head of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> office and to take a fuzzier international role.
Yesterday, just a day after <PERSON>Mr. Roman</PERSON> announced he would leave to take a top post at <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>WPP</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Mr. Berry</PERSON> would return to take an international role at the parent company. 
<PERSON>Mr. Berry</PERSON> said the timing was a coincidence and that his decision was unrelated to <PERSON>Mr. Roman</PERSON>'s departure. 
<ORGANIZATION>RJR Nabisco Inc.</ORGANIZATION> awarded its national broadcast media-buying assignment to FCB/Leber <ORGANIZATION>Katz Partners</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> outpost of Chicago-based Foote, <ORGANIZATION>Cone & Belding</ORGANIZATION>. 
The naming of FCB/Leber <ORGANIZATION>Katz Partners</ORGANIZATION> as agency of record for <ORGANIZATION>Nabisco Brands Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Planters LifeSavers Co.</ORGANIZATION> follows <ORGANIZATION>RJR Nabisco</ORGANIZATION>'s announcement last week that it will disband its <ORGANIZATION>RJR Nabisco Broadcast</ORGANIZATION> division and dismiss its 14 employees Dec. 1. to cut costs.
HOLIDAY PROMOTION: <ORGANIZATION>PepsiCo Inc.</ORGANIZATION> will give away 4,000 sets of "Game Boy," <PERSON>Nintendo</PERSON>'s new hand-held video game in a two-month promotion scheduled to begin Nov. 1.
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON>, confirming comments made this week by Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>, said <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> is "interested" in finding a suitable test case.
Last week, <PERSON>Sen. Malcolm Wallop</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Wyo.</LOCATION>) held hearings on a bill to strengthen an existing law designed to reduce regulatory hassles for small businesses. "A great many federal regulations are meant for larger entities and don't really apply to small businesses," says <PERSON>Marian Jacob</PERSON>, a legislative aide to <PERSON>Sen. Wallop</PERSON>.
Rules that set standards for products or govern business behavior, generally the best regarded form of red tape, "create a level playing field and keep unscrupulous competitors away," says <PERSON>Sidney West</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>TechDesign International Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Springfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, business that designs telecommunication and other products.
<PERSON>Mr. West</PERSON> cites the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Communications Commission</ORGANIZATION> and its standards for telecommunications equipment: "They monitor product quality and prevent junk from flooding the market." 
Determining when handicapped access is required can be a nightmare for architects, says <PERSON>Mark Dooling</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Dooling & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Newton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, architectural firm.
Taxi, leasing and other companies that maintain fleets of vehicles devote substantial resources to complying with state insurance laws and a host of agencies. "It's very costly and time-consuming," says <PERSON>Phil Rosen</PERSON>, a partner in <ORGANIZATION>Fleet & Leasing Management Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> car-leasing company.
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS: Next to medical insurance, "costs of compliance" are the fastest-growing expense at <ORGANIZATION>Impco Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Providence</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>R.I.</LOCATION>, chemical company.
<PERSON>Mr. Gebhard</PERSON> adds that spending on environmental red tape amounts to between 6.5% and 7.5% of <ORGANIZATION>Impco</ORGANIZATION>'s total operating expenses. 
<ORGANIZATION>Eastern Reproduction Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Waltham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, maker of thin metal precision parts, must report to five federal and state agencies as well as to local fire, police, hospital and plumbing authorities, says <PERSON>Robert Maguire</PERSON>, president.
It's especially nettlesome "if you're on the road and you're the one responsible," says <PERSON>Eddie Brown</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Brown Capital Management Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> money-management firm. 
EMPLOYEE MANUALS: Revising employee manuals on pensions, health care and other subjects costs over $25,000 a year for <PERSON>Bert Giguiere</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Professional Agricultural Management Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Fresno</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, provider of business services to farmers.
<PERSON>Alice Fixx</PERSON>, who runs her own public-relations concern in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, says she has had to overhaul her pension and profit-sharing plans three times in the past three years. "It doesn't increase benefits, but it's costly and time-consuming," <PERSON>Ms. Fixx</PERSON> says.
To justify their exempt status and avoid penalties, these businesses must show once a year that each and every transaction on which they didn't pay sales tax was a legitimate business expense. "You need one person to just take care of sales tax," says <PERSON>Jennie Tong</PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Lee Liu & Tong Advertising Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
But <PERSON>David Runkel</PERSON>, chief <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the guidelines "are a codification and a clarification far more than a new direction." 
<PERSON>Mr. Runkel</PERSON> declined to speculate on whether the guidelines would curb racketeering prosecutions against corporate defendants. "The impact, if there is any, will be impossible to judge ahead of time because the decision whether to use {racketeering charges} is made in individual cases" by <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, he said. 
In a memorandum describing the guidelines, Assistant Attorney General <PERSON>Edward Dennis Jr.</PERSON> said that government efforts to freeze defendants' assets pending racketeering prosecutions "have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press." But <PERSON>Mr. Runkel</PERSON> said the government isn't "backing off on these kinds of matters at all." 
The agreement is effective Jan. 1 and is subject to approval from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Investment Review Board</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Cadbury Schweppes Australia Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> has held the <LOCATION>Australian Pepsi</LOCATION> franchise for the past four years.
Lion <PERSON>Nathan</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>PepsiCola Australia</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>PepsiCo Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, didn't say why <PERSON>Cadbury Schweppes</PERSON> will no longer hold the franchise. 
<ORGANIZATION>Time Warner Inc.</ORGANIZATION> is considering a legal challenge to <ORGANIZATION>Tele-Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's plan to buy half of <ORGANIZATION>Showtime Networks Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a move that could lead to all-out war between the cable industry's two most powerful players. 
Time is also fighting the transaction on other fronts, by attempting to discourage other cable operators from joining <ORGANIZATION>Tele-Communications</ORGANIZATION> as investors in <LOCATION>Showtime</LOCATION>, cable-TV industry executives say.
Last week, <ORGANIZATION>Tele-Communications</ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay <ORGANIZATION>Viacom Inc.</ORGANIZATION> $225 million for a 50% stake in its Showtime subsidiary, which is a distant second to <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION>'s Home Box Office in the delivery of pay-TV networks to cable subscribers.
<ORGANIZATION>Tele-Communications</ORGANIZATION> is <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION>'s largest customer, and the two have a number of other business relationships.
Earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION> even discussed bringing <ORGANIZATION>Tele-Communications</ORGANIZATION> in as an investor in <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION>, executives at both companies said.
Time is expected to mount a legal challenge in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District Court in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION>Viacom</ORGANIZATION> in May filed a $2.5 billion antitrust suit charging <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION> with monopolizing the pay-TV business and trying to crush competition from <LOCATION>Showtime</LOCATION>.
Executives involved in plotting <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION>'s defense say it is now preparing a countersuit naming both <ORGANIZATION>Viacom</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Tele-Communications</ORGANIZATION> as defendants.
<PERSON>Jerome Kern</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Tele-Communications</ORGANIZATION>' chief outside counsel, said he wasn't aware of <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION>'s legal plans.
But he said that any effort by Time to characterize the <ORGANIZATION>Tele-Communications</ORGANIZATION> investment in <LOCATION>Showtime</LOCATION> as anti-competitive would be "the pot calling the kettle black." 
In addition to owning <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION>, with 22 million subscribers, <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner</ORGANIZATION> separately operates cable-TV system serving about 5.6 million cable-TV subscribers.
<ORGANIZATION>Tele-Communications</ORGANIZATION> controls close to 12 million cable subscribers, and <ORGANIZATION>Viacom</ORGANIZATION> has about one million.
In its suit against <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Viacom</ORGANIZATION> says the ownership of both cable systems and cable-programming networks gives the company too much market power.
Time argues that in joining up with <ORGANIZATION>Tele-Communications</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Viacom</ORGANIZATION> has potentially more power, particularly since <ORGANIZATION>Viacom</ORGANIZATION> also owns cable networks <ORGANIZATION>MTV</ORGANIZATION>, VH-1 and <ORGANIZATION>Nick</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Nite</ORGANIZATION>.
Together, they control nearly 40% of <ORGANIZATION>Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Tele-Communications</ORGANIZATION> has a 21.8% stake, while <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner</ORGANIZATION> has a 17.8% stake.
But since <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION>'s merger with <ORGANIZATION>Warner Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, relations between the two have become strained.
Meanwhile, some legal observers say the <ORGANIZATION>Tele-Communications</ORGANIZATION> investment and other developments are weakening <ORGANIZATION>Viacom</ORGANIZATION>'s antitrust suit against Time.
<ORGANIZATION>Viacom</ORGANIZATION> accuses Time in its suit of refusing to carry Showtime or a sister service, The Movie Channel, on <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> Cable TV system, one of the nation's largest urban systems.
Showtime has also accused <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION> of locking up the lion's share of <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>'s movies by signing exclusive contracts with all the major studios.
But <PERSON>Showtime</PERSON> has continued to sign new contracts with <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> studios, and yesterday announced it will buy movies from <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which currently has a non-exclusive arrangement with <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION>. 
But the mouse experiment at a <ORGANIZATION>Medical Research Council</ORGANIZATION> laboratory in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> shows genetic defects can be detected three days after conception using a new American-developed gene-copying technique.

Almost 40% of schizophrenic men have an impaired sense of smell vs. fewer than 10% of schizophrenic women, reports the <ORGANIZATION>American Journal of Psychiatry</ORGANIZATION>. 
The government said it would streamline its enormous and often-criticized food marketing and distribution network, <ORGANIZATION>Compania Nacional</ORGANIZATION> de Subsistencias Populares, or <LOCATION>Conasupo</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Ovalle</PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION>Conasupo</ORGANIZATION> will cut back subsidies to producers of nonessential farm products and close retail outlets in wealthy neighborhoods. 
The stock market went on a dizzying ride as <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, once again led shares into a breathtaking decline and then an afternoon comeback. 
"October 13th left us with a cut and exposed nerve," said <PERSON>Jack Solomon</PERSON>, technical analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Bear Stearns</ORGANIZATION>. "People are fearful and sensitive.
Under a post-1987 crash reform, the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION> wouldn't permit the December <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> futures to fall further than 12 points for a half hour.
Traders said <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers</ORGANIZATION> were the main force behind the futures buying at the pivotal moment.
Officials at <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers</ORGANIZATION> were unavailable for comment. 
Five minutes before the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> opened, a preliminary price was flashed for <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> -- somewhere between 135 and 155, a loss of as much as $43 a share from Monday's close. 
Floor traders said there was a huge crowd around the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> specialist's post where <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> trades. "There was a seething mass of people," said one floor trader. "Then there was a big liquidation of stock" across the board, he added. 
Takeover speculators -- who have already taken a record loss estimated at more than $700 million on <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> -- started selling other stocks as well as <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> futures in an attempt to hedge against a further <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> blood bath.
Shortly after the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> opening, program traders started selling stocks in the Major Market Index and <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 index.
All 20-stocks in the <ORGANIZATION>MMI</ORGANIZATION> except <ORGANIZATION>Exxon</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION> were down $1 to $2. 
At 10:33, when the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 December futures contract crunched to a 12-point loss under the force of sell programs, <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> futures trading was halted and program trades on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> were routed into a special computer that scans for order imbalances.
Then, in late-afternoon trading, hundred-thousand-share buy orders for <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> hit the market, including a 200,000-share order through <PERSON>Bear Stearns</PERSON> that seemed to spark <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>'s late price surge.
Some institutional traders loved the wild ride. "This is fun," asserted <PERSON>Susan Del Signore</PERSON>, head equity trader at <ORGANIZATION>Travelers Investment Management Co</ORGANIZATION>.
But traders who risk money handling big blocks of stock were shaken. "This market is eating away my youth," said <PERSON>Chung Lew</PERSON>, head equity trader at <ORGANIZATION>Kleinwort Benson North America Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "Credibility sounds intangible.
Other issues said to be included in the buy program were <ORGANIZATION>Procter & Gamble</ORGANIZATION>, which rose 2 7/8 to 133 1/2; <LOCATION>Atlantic Richfield</LOCATION>, which gained 2 to 103 3/4, and <ORGANIZATION>Rockwell International</ORGANIZATION>, which jumped 2 3/4 to 27 1/8.

<ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, fell 1 3/4 to 68 7/8 on 2.3 million shares; <ORGANIZATION>Delta Air Lines</ORGANIZATION> lost 1 1/2 to 66, <ORGANIZATION>Southwest Airlines</ORGANIZATION> slid 3/4 to 24 1/4 and <ORGANIZATION>Midway Airlines</ORGANIZATION> dropped 1/4 to 14 7/8.

Other stocks in the <ORGANIZATION>Dow</ORGANIZATION> industrials that failed to benefit from the market's rebound included <ORGANIZATION>United Technologies</ORGANIZATION>, which dropped 1 to 53 5/8, and <ORGANIZATION>Bethle hem Steel</ORGANIZATION>, which fell 1 to 16 7/8. 
<ORGANIZATION>BankAmerica</ORGANIZATION> dropped 1 1/4 to 29 1/2 on 2.3 million shares amid rumors that the earthquake last week in the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> area had caused structural damage to its headquarters building.
<ORGANIZATION>Great Western Financial</ORGANIZATION> lost 1 1/8 to 20 1/2 on 1.6 million shares, <ORGANIZATION>Golden West Financial</ORGANIZATION> dropped 1 1/4 to 28 1/2 and <ORGANIZATION>H.F. Ahmanson</ORGANIZATION> dipped 5/8 to 21 1/4.
Dividend-related trading swelled volume in two issues: <ORGANIZATION>Security Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, which fell 7/8 to 44 1/2 and led the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s most actives list on composite volume of 14.8 million shares, and <ORGANIZATION>Nipsco Industries</ORGANIZATION>, which lost 3/8 to 17 3/8 on 4.4 million shares.
<ORGANIZATION>Vista Chemical</ORGANIZATION> rose 1 3/8 to 38 5/8 after <PERSON>Bear Stearns</PERSON> added the stock to the firm's buy list, citing recent price weakness. 
<ORGANIZATION>Georgia Gulf</ORGANIZATION>, another producer of commodity chemicals, advanced 2 to 49 1/2; <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Harold Simmons</PERSON>, who holds about 10% of its shares, said he hasn't raised his stake. 
<PERSON>John Harland</PERSON>, which will replace <ORGANIZATION>American Medical International</ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 following Wednesday's close, gained 5/8 to 24 1/8. 
<ORGANIZATION>Harken Energy Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> said it will drop its $11.75-a-share, or $190 million, offer for <ORGANIZATION>Tesoro Petroleum Corp.</ORGANIZATION> if the two companies don't have an agreement to merge by Dec. 15. 
<ORGANIZATION>Harken</ORGANIZATION>, which made its offer in August, said it still is awaiting a response to its offer from <LOCATION>Tesoro</LOCATION>'s board. 
<PERSON>Harken</PERSON> also said that its financing from <ORGANIZATION>Bankers Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION> has been extended until Dec. 15 to give <LOCATION>Tesoro</LOCATION>'s board time to consider the offer at a <LOCATION>Tesoro</LOCATION> board meeting scheduled for mid-November. 
<PERSON>Harken</PERSON>, which owns about 800 retail gas stations, has said it is particularly interested in <LOCATION>Tesoro</LOCATION>'s refinery because it would fill a gap in its business.
However, <LOCATION>Tesoro</LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, already has rejected a suitor in the past year. 
<ORGANIZATION>The Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION> banned all imports of mushrooms from <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> in response to a rash of food-poisoning outbreaks linked to canned Chinese mushrooms. 
"The agency has concluded that contamination may be widespread throughout the mushroom-processing industry in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>," an <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said yesterday.
The agency won't allow mushrooms that were canned or packed in brine at any Chinese plant to enter the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> until "satisfactory sanitation-control measures are implemented in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> to prevent" bacterial contamination. 
On May 19, the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> began detaining Chinese mushrooms in 68-ounce cans after more than 100 people in <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> became ill from eating tainted mushrooms.
In 1987, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> exported 65 million pounds of mushrooms, valued at $47 million, to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Chinese Embassy</ORGANIZATION> here said that the <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> government has taken "many effective measures" to stop the mushroom contamination and is further investigating the underlying causes.
After the legislature confirmed him as the <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> leader, <PERSON>Krenz</PERSON> said demonstrations to demand democratic freedoms could cause a "worsening of the situation, or confrontation." He also reaffirmed <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>'s allegiance to Communist orthodoxy.
During the balloting, 26 members of the 500-seat <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> voted against <PERSON>Krenz</PERSON>, a move considered unprecedented in the country's 40-year history. 
The <LOCATION>Iran-Contra</LOCATION> judge agreed to allow <PERSON>Poindexter</PERSON> to subpoena the personal papers of ex-President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>, ruling that there was sufficient evidence that the data would be important to the defense.
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials expressed skepticism over an Israeli effort to show the <ORGANIZATION>PLO</ORGANIZATION> continues to practice terrorism.
<LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> provided the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> with a list of recent alleged terrorist incidents attributed to forces controlled by <PERSON>Arafat</PERSON>, but the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> said it wasn't satisfied that the incidents constituted terrorism. 
TV evangelist <PERSON>Jim Bakker</PERSON> was sentenced to 45 years in prison and fined $500,000 for defrauding followers of his <ORGANIZATION>PTL ministry</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Bakker</PERSON>, who was immediately taken into custody, was convicted Oct. 5 by a federal court jury in <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, of fraud and conspiracy for diverting more than $3.7 million of ministry funds for personal use. 
Lawmakers in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> voted to deny the <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> its 100 guaranteed seats in the Soviet <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, meaning <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> and other aides might have to face voters.
In <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Shevardnadze</PERSON> held his first talks with the Solidarity-led government and vowed to maintain fuel supplies.
<LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>'s premier is to visit <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> next month.

<ORGANIZATION>Time Warner Inc.</ORGANIZATION> reported a third-quarter net loss of $176 million, or $2.88 cents a share, reflecting acquisition costs for a 59.3% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Warner Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and the purchase method of accounting for the transaction. 
<ORGANIZATION>Time Warner</ORGANIZATION> is in the process of completing its acquisition of the remaining <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> shares.
On a pro-forma basis, assuming the merger was effective Jan 1, 1988, including the results from both <ORGANIZATION>Time Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and all of <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>, that cash flow figure would be $526 million for the latest quarter, more than double the comparable figure a year ago, or $242 million, according to <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner</ORGANIZATION>. 
Some analysts at least are buying that argument, and weren't alarmed by the losses. "What really matters is the operating income of the divisions: I look at these numbers and I say, these businesses are doing well," said <PERSON>Mark Manson</PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.</ORGANIZATION> "For example, <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> made more than $100 million from filmed entertainment in three months.
On a pro forma basis, including all of <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>'s earnings, <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner</ORGANIZATION> had a third-quarter loss of $217 million, compared with a $342 million loss a year earlier.
The 1988 figures were restated to include the results of <ORGANIZATION>Lorimar Telepictures Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> acquired in January. 
<ORGANIZATION>Time Warner</ORGANIZATION>'s operating earnings got a boost from <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>'s record box-office results. "Batman" alone has racked up more than $247 million in box-office receipts to date, making it <ORGANIZATION>Warner Bros.</ORGANIZATION> ' largest grossing film ever. "Lethal Weapon II" was also a big hit.
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> also contributed record results from its music business, where unit sales of compact discs rose more than 50% from a year ago, the company said, helped by <ORGANIZATION>Prince</ORGANIZATION>'s "Batman" soundtrack. 
On the other hand, <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner</ORGANIZATION> said its operating cash flow declined in the quarter for its magazine division, its books division and the <ORGANIZATION>Home Box Office</ORGANIZATION> programming division.
The programming division saw a decline in operating cash flow because the year-ago quarter included a $12 million dividend from <ORGANIZATION>Turner Broadcasting System</ORGANIZATION> and because the quarter includes expenses associated with the Nov. 15 launch of <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION>'s Comedy Channel. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner</ORGANIZATION> closed at $138.625 a share, up $1.875, while <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> closed at $63.875 a share, up 12.5 cents. 
The product will be distributed by <ORGANIZATION>Pitman-Moore Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>International Minerals</ORGANIZATION>.

<ORGANIZATION>BSB BANCORP Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Binghamton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, said it increased its regular quarterly dividend 50%, to 15 cents a share from 10 cents.
Not to be outdone, <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> wants CFCs banished altogether by the year 2000, a goal endorsed at an 80-nation <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> environmental meeting in <LOCATION>Helsinki</LOCATION> in the spring. 
<PERSON>Peter Teagan</PERSON>, a specialist in heat transfer, is running a project at <ORGANIZATION>Arthur D. Little Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, to find alternative technologies that will allow industry to eliminate CFCs.
<ORGANIZATION>Imperial Chemical Industries</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> also has one, and is building a plant in <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> to produce it.
Four Democrats on the <ORGANIZATION>House Banking Committee</ORGANIZATION> sent President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> a letter stating their concerns about the expected appointment of <PERSON>James Simmons</PERSON>, an <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> banker and former fund-raiser for <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>, to the Oversight Board of the <ORGANIZATION>Resolution Trust Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Oversight Board</ORGANIZATION>, created in the savings-and-loan law signed in August, sets policy for the <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION>, which will sell hundreds of the nation's sick thrifts and billions of dollars of their assets.
Treasury Secretary <PERSON>Nicholas Brady</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Board</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Alan Greenspan</PERSON> and Housing and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON>Jack Kemp</PERSON> are members of the board.
An administration official confirmed last week that <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON>, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Valley National Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, is the Republican appointee, and that a security clearance was under way.
<PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON> declined to comment, and the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> said the congressmen's letter is under review. 
The letter, dated last Thursday, cited the losses at <ORGANIZATION>Valley National</ORGANIZATION>, and at <ORGANIZATION>United Bank</ORGANIZATION>, also of <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON> was chairman for 29 years.
"We believe that there are numerous other candidates more qualified for this important position and we encourage you to give them your thorough consideration before making this key <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION> appointment," the letter said. "The <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION> needs the most able, competent management available." 
He was co-chairman of <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> campaign committee in last year's election, and also worked for <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> in the 1980 election.
The two met more than 30 years ago, when <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON> worked for <ORGANIZATION>Commercial Bank & Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Midland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> was an organizing director. 
In 1986, <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON> also served on a committee of businessmen headed by <PERSON>William Seidman</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Resolution Trust Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Arizona Trend magazine</ORGANIZATION> referred to <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON> this year as one of the 25 most influential people in the state.

<ORGANIZATION>American Medical International Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> hospital operator, will be deleted from the index at that time.
Meanwhile, like many other oil companies hurt by less-profitable downstream businesses, <ORGANIZATION>Mobil Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Shell Oil Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Chevron Corp.</ORGANIZATION> reported lower quarterly earnings. 
"The company has been completely revamped," said <PERSON>Frank Knuettel</PERSON>, analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
Sun said some of the growth reflects higher earnings in the oil sands operation of <ORGANIZATION>Suncor</ORGANIZATION>, a majority-owned <LOCATION>Canadian</LOCATION> subsidiary.
Overseas exploration and production results also improved because of additional output from the <LOCATION>North Sea Magnus Field</LOCATION>, a portion of which was acquired by <ORGANIZATION>Sun</ORGANIZATION> earlier this year.
President <PERSON>Frank Richardson</PERSON> attributed the decline to lower natural gas prices, which countered higher earnings from the crude oil sector of <ORGANIZATION>Shell</ORGANIZATION>'s exploration and production operation.
Results included a $37 million gain from the sale of rights from <LOCATION>Chevron</LOCATION>'s investment in <ORGANIZATION>Amax Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, and a loss of $30 million from the sale of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> oil and gas properties.
<ORGANIZATION>Birtcher Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it signed a definitive agreement with <ORGANIZATION>C.R. Bard Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Murray Hill</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, maker of health-care products, for the purchase of the company's <ORGANIZATION>Bard/EMS Electrosurgery</ORGANIZATION> division for about $11 million. 
Bard/ <ORGANIZATION>EMS</ORGANIZATION> had 1988 sales of about $14 million, <PERSON>Birtcher</PERSON> said. 
Just ask <PERSON>Richard Blumenfeld</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> dentist who considers himself "a reasonably sophisticated investor." 
In May 1986, <PERSON>Dr. Blumenfeld</PERSON> gave <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION> about $40,000 for a federally insured certificate of deposit offering an effective yield of more than 9%. 
But nearly 3 1/2 years later, <ORGANIZATION>Merrill</ORGANIZATION> says the investment is worth about $43,000 -- an amount that represents an annual return of just over 2% on <PERSON>Dr. Blumenfeld</PERSON>'s $40,000. 
"Yield greed often gets in the way of understanding things," says <PERSON>John Markese</PERSON>, research director of the <ORGANIZATION>American Association of Individual Investors</ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based educational group. "The biggest problem we have is that investors realize, after the fact, that they didn't understand what they were investing in." 
He says that he knew he was getting a zero-coupon CD and that he had previously invested in TIGRs (<ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Income Growth Receipts), a type of zero-coupon <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> security sold by <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION>.
The broker, <PERSON>Thomas Beairsto</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Morristown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, office, refuses to discuss the matter with a reporter, referring inquiries to <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
Nevertheless, <PERSON>Merrill Lynch</PERSON> has agreed that if the thrift that issued <PERSON>Dr. Blumenfeld</PERSON>'s CD, <ORGANIZATION>Peoples Heritage Federal Savings & Loan Association</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Salina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kan.</LOCATION>, is liquidated and the CD terminated, the brokerage firm would cover the premium <PERSON>Dr. Blumenfeld</PERSON> paid. (Federal deposit insurance would pay principal and interest accrued to the date of liquidation, to a maximum of $100,000.) 
"It's not a blanket commitment, it's a case-by-case situation," says <PERSON>Albert Disposti</PERSON>, a managing director of <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch Money Markets Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "There's a question whether brokers at the time were fully aware" of the risks. "We weren't sure that full disclosure, as we wanted it, was being made." 
<ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION> says it's impossible to estimate how many investors are in <PERSON>Dr. Blumenfeld</PERSON>'s situation, although it says the firm has received only one other complaint about premiums on the secondary market in three years.
<PERSON>Walter M. Brady</PERSON> was named a senior vice president of this insurer in the <LOCATION>Canadian</LOCATION> head office.
<PERSON>Frank J. Ollari</PERSON> was named senior vice president in charge of the mortgage <ORGANIZATION>finance department</ORGANIZATION>.
With reduced exports and rising imports, <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>'s trade surpluses with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> between January and September fell sharply from a year ago, the <ORGANIZATION>Customs Administration</ORGANIZATION> said. 
Officials said <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>'s trade surplus with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> for the first nine months of the year totaled $3.49 billion, down 43% from the same period last year on a customs-clearance basis. 
South Korean exports to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> during the period fell 1.6% from a year ago to $15.06 billion, while imports from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> soared 26% to $11.56 billion. 
<ORGANIZATION>Staar Surgical Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's board said that it has removed <PERSON>Thomas R. Waggoner</PERSON> as president and chief executive officer and that <PERSON>John R. Wolf</PERSON>, formerly executive vice president, sales and marketing, has been named president and chief executive officer. 
The company's latest announcement said <PERSON>Mr. Waggoner</PERSON> will remain a director of <ORGANIZATION>Staar</ORGANIZATION>, a maker of products for small-incision surgery.
The <ORGANIZATION>Staar</ORGANIZATION> board also said that <PERSON>John R. Ford</PERSON> resigned as a director, and that <PERSON>Mr. Wolf</PERSON> was named a member of the board. 
But <PERSON>A.C. Moore</PERSON>, director of research at <ORGANIZATION>Argus Research</ORGANIZATION>, said last week's rally was a reflex reaction to the Oct. 13 stock market rout.
<PERSON>Hugh Johnson</PERSON>, chief investment officer at <ORGANIZATION>First Albany Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, agreed that a deteriorating economy is worrisome, but he said the real concern among stock investors is that some new problem will crop up in the junk bond market. 
Under the accord, <PERSON>Albert Roth</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, and <PERSON>Arthur Chase</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sam Beigel</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Louis Polsky</PERSON> will resign as officers and directors of the menswear retailer.
<PERSON>Mr. Roth</PERSON>, who has been on leave from his posts, will be succeeded by <PERSON>Geoffrie D. Lurie</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>GDL Management Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which is <ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION>'s crisis manager.
In addition, a <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION> affiliate, <ORGANIZATION>York Capital Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, will purchase all of the interests of <ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION>'s secured lenders, which total $11.5 million, and guarantee as much as $8.2 million in payments to <ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION>'s unsecured creditors.
It would extinguish all of <ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION>'s existing capital stock and issue new stock to <LOCATION>York</LOCATION> as sole holder. 
In its bankruptcy-law petition, filed in <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Bankruptcy Court</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION> said its problems began in 1987 and early 1988 when its then-senior lender, <ORGANIZATION>Bankers Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION>, reduced its credit line.
In September 1988, <ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION>Biny Clothing Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a closely held <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> chain operated under the Bonds name.
<ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION>'s management retired and <ORGANIZATION>Biny</ORGANIZATION>'s management took control of the company. 
At the time, <ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION> reached a new credit agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Bankers Trust</ORGANIZATION> and with <ORGANIZATION>Bank Leumi Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> for $8 million, and a new subordinated debt accord with <ORGANIZATION>First Century Partners</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Biny</ORGANIZATION> management for $2 million.
<ORGANIZATION>MCA Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said its toy-making unit agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION>Buddy L Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, producer of a line of toy vehicles and preschool products. 
The price wasn't disclosed, but an executive of <ORGANIZATION>LJN Toys Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> unit, said the closely held Buddy L had annual sales in excess of $20 million.
As part of a previously announced transaction, <ORGANIZATION>Federal Mogul Corp.</ORGANIZATION> has bought approximately 565,000 shares of its common stock from <ORGANIZATION>Nortek Inc.</ORGANIZATION> at $23.50 a share.
Rubbermaid officials said they aren't aware of any effort to take over the company, but believed the shareholder plan needed to be strengthened. "The board has stated repeatedly that <PERSON>Rubbermaid</PERSON> should be independent," said <PERSON>Walter W. Williams</PERSON>, <PERSON>Rubbermaid</PERSON> president. 
Some changes to the plan were minor adjustments, but the most significant was an amendment that provides that if any investor holds 25% or more of <PERSON>Rubbermaid</PERSON>'s voting securities, each right held by others would entitle the holder to buy <ORGANIZATION>Rubbermaid</ORGANIZATION> shares with a market value of twice the right's exercise price. 
Thus at the recent governors' conference on education, Gov. <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> announced that "this country needs a comprehensive child-development policy for children under five." A comprehensive development policy for governors over 30 would seem to be a more pressing need.
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> is in the process of trying to disengage itself from a 20-year-old commitment to this system of school governance, even as <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> and other cities are moving to institute it. 
Anyone who wants to appreciate just how bizarre this situation is -- with students who can't add or subtract "learning" the conceptual basis of mathematical theory -- should read the article by <PERSON>Caleb Nelson</PERSON> (himself a recent math major at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION>) in the November American Spectator.

Moreover, the two main bridges still connecting <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> with the <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION> didn't charge tolls, allowing traffic to zip through without stopping.
Her commute from <LOCATION>Petaluma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, normally takes an hour and 15 minutes, via the <LOCATION>Golden Gate Bridge</LOCATION>, which connects <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> with the <LOCATION>North Bay</LOCATION> area.
But while traffic was heavy early in the commute over the Golden Gate, by 8 a.m. it already had thinned out. "It's one of the smoothest commutes I've ever had," said <PERSON>Charles Catania</PERSON>, an insurance broker on the bus from <LOCATION>Mill Valley</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Marin County</LOCATION>. "It looks like a holiday.
At the <LOCATION>San Mateo Bridge</LOCATION>, which connects the <LOCATION>San Francisco peninsula</LOCATION> with the <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION>, police were surprised at the speed with which traffic moved.

<ORGANIZATION>Pacific Gas & Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> is offering its 6,000 <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> employees a two-tier flextime schedule -- either 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. or 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
One senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Bechtel</ORGANIZATION> said he got up at 3 a.m. to drive into <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> from the <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION>. 
Americans are drinking less, but young professionals from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> are rushing to buy premium-brand American vodka, brandy and other spirits.
With <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> liquor consumption declining steadily, many <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> producers are stepping up their marketing efforts abroad.
"Spirits companies now view themselves as global marketers," says <PERSON>Michael Bellas</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Beverage Marketing Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a research and consulting firm. "If you want to be a player, you have to be in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>.
In recent years, for example, <ORGANIZATION>Grand Metropolitan PLC</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION>Heublein Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, while another <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> company, <ORGANIZATION>Guinness PLC</ORGANIZATION>, took over <ORGANIZATION>United Distillers Group and Schenley Industries Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
While premium-brand spirits like <PERSON>Smirnoff</PERSON> vodka and <PERSON>Jack Daniel</PERSON>'s whiskey are riding high in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, domestic spirits consumption fell 15% to 141.1 million cases in 1988 from 166 million cases in 1979. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> brandy exports more than doubled last year to 360,000 proof gallons, a standard industry measure, according to <ORGANIZATION>Jobson Beverage Alcohol Group</ORGANIZATION>, an industry association.
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> wineries, benefiting from lowered trade barriers and federal marketing subsidies, are expanding aggressively into <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, as well as <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>.
In <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Brown-Forman Corp.</ORGANIZATION> has increased its marketing of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Comfort Liqueur</ORGANIZATION>.
Using cinema, television and print ads, the company pitches <ORGANIZATION>Southern Comfort</ORGANIZATION> as a grand old drink of the antebellum <LOCATION>American South</LOCATION>. 
While <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> makers of vodka, rum and other spirits compete against powerhouses abroad, trade agreements prohibit any other country from making bourbon. (All bourbon comes from <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, though <PERSON>Jack Daniel</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> whiskey often is counted as bourbon because of similarity of taste.) Moreover, just as vodka has acquired an upscale image in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, bourbon has become fashionable in many foreign countries, a uniquely American product tied to frontier folklore.
"We imagine with bourbon the Wild West, Western motion pictures and gunmen appearing," says <PERSON>Kenji Kishimoto</PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Suntory International Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION>Suntory Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s largest liquor company.
Suntory distributes <PERSON>Brown-Forman</PERSON> bourbons in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
Bourbon makes up just 1% of world-wide spirits consumption, but it represented 57% of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> liquor exports last year, according to <PERSON>Jobson</PERSON>; no other category had more than 19%.
<ORGANIZATION>Jim Beam Brands Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION>American Brands Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, is the leading exporter of bourbon and produces 10 other types of liquor.
<ORGANIZATION>Guinness</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Schenley Industries</ORGANIZATION> unit has increased its TV advertising in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and has built partnerships with duty-free shops throughout <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, enabling it to install prominent counter displays.
The company's <ORGANIZATION>I.W. Harper</ORGANIZATION> brand is the leading bourbon in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, with 40% of the market. 
<ORGANIZATION>Jim Beam Brands</ORGANIZATION> has a distribution partnership with <ORGANIZATION>Nikka Whiskey Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a distiller.
<ORGANIZATION>Seagram Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which exports Four Roses bourbon, has such a link with <ORGANIZATION>Kirin Brewery Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
To promote <PERSON>Jack Daniel</PERSON>'s overseas, <PERSON>Brown-Forman</PERSON> uses the same photos of front porches from <LOCATION>Lynchburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, and avuncular old men in overalls and hightops. 
In <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, land of the outback, a snapshot of <PERSON>Jim Beam</PERSON> lies on a strip of hand-tooled leather.
Disappointing earnings news from some technology companies unnerved investors in the over-the-counter market, who sold shares of <ORGANIZATION>Apple Computer</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION> and many other computer-related concerns. 
But <PERSON>Charlie Howley</PERSON>, vice president in charge of <ORGANIZATION>OTC</ORGANIZATION> trading at <ORGANIZATION>SoundView Financial</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Stamford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, said the selling was orderly. 
Other technology stocks that were weaker included <ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION>, which fell 1 1/4 to 33 1/2 on 1.9 million shares, Mentor Graphics, down 3/4 to 16 1/4 on 1.6 million shares, <ORGANIZATION>Sun Microsystems</ORGANIZATION>, which slipped 3/8 to 18 1/4, and <ORGANIZATION>MCI Communications</ORGANIZATION>, down 1 to 42 3/4.
Among takeover stocks, <PERSON>Jefferson Smurfit</PERSON> jumped 1 1/4 to 42 1/2 after SIBV-MS Holdings said the price to be paid to <PERSON>Jefferson Smurfit</PERSON>'s minority holders has been raised to $43 a share.
SIBV-MS Holdings is a new company jointly owned by an affiliate of <PERSON>Jefferson Smurfit</PERSON> and a <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley</ORGANIZATION> limited partnership.
The <PERSON>Jefferson Smurfit</PERSON> affiliate, <ORGANIZATION>Smurfit International B.V.</ORGANIZATION>, holds about 78% of the shares outstanding.
<ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION>'s suitor, <ORGANIZATION>McCaw Cellular Communications</ORGANIZATION>, dropped 1 to 40 on almost 350,000 shares. 
<PERSON>Michael R. Weisberg</PERSON>, partner in charge of research at <ORGANIZATION>Robertson Stephens & Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, said some investors have already made the switch.
He puts the OTC market's <ORGANIZATION>Nellcor</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Office Club</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>BizMart</ORGANIZATION> on the list. 
<LOCATION>Payco American</LOCATION>, a credit collection concern, jumped 1 3/8 to 20 5/8 on volume of 93,000, and <ORGANIZATION>Mail Boxes Etc.</ORGANIZATION>, a private postal services company, advanced 1/2 to 23 1/2 on volume of 64,000.
<ORGANIZATION>Amgen</ORGANIZATION> rose 2 1/4 to 54 3/4 on almost 800,000 shares, and <ORGANIZATION>CVB Financial</ORGANIZATION> jumped 4 to 41 on only 1,000 shares. 
<ORGANIZATION>Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION>Lakeland First Financial Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Succasunna</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, bank holding company, for about $50.6 million in cash and stock. 
Citizens First, which controls <ORGANIZATION>Citizens First National Bank</ORGANIZATION> and is based in <LOCATION>Glen Rock</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, will pay a maximum of 40% in cash for the parent of <ORGANIZATION>Lakeland Savings Bank</ORGANIZATION> and the remainder in convertible preferred stock, with a liquidation value of $18 a share.
In an Oct. 10 editorial-page article, "It's the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s Turn to Adjust," <PERSON>Paul Craig Roberts</PERSON> lays most of the blame for what ails developing countries at the doorstep of the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION>.
One of <PERSON>Mr. Roberts</PERSON>'s observations is that the <ORGANIZATION>Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s own loan portfolio is in deep trouble because of its lending to developing countries.
Another of <PERSON>Mr. Roberts</PERSON>'s criticisms is that <ORGANIZATION>Bank</ORGANIZATION> lending has done more harm than good "by implanting the wrong incentives and deflecting energy away from economic development." Here, too, <PERSON>Mr. Roberts</PERSON> is way off the mark.
In my home region, <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>, much of the existing infrastructure base -- an important building block for development -- has been financed by the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Roberts</PERSON> also takes a swipe at the <ORGANIZATION>Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s adjustment lending.
Most recently, the <ORGANIZATION>Bank Group</ORGANIZATION> has been expanded to include the <ORGANIZATION>Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency</ORGANIZATION> to stimulate direct foreign investment in developing countries by offering guarantees against noncommercial risk and advice to member countries on how to improve their business climate. 
Sales of medium and heavy-duty trucks continue to lag previous-year rates, leading <ORGANIZATION>Eaton</ORGANIZATION> to expect fourth-quarter net income to fall below year-earlier levels, said <PERSON>Stephen R. Hardis</PERSON>, vice chairman and chief financial and administrative officer.
The quarter net was below analyst expectations mainly because truck-parts sales didn't rebound in September from the summer doldrums as they usually do, said <PERSON>Patrick E. Sheridan</PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION>McDonald & Co</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Sheridan</PERSON>, who had been expecting quarter profit of about $1.25 a share, says he is reducing his estimate for the year to the area of $5.70 a share, from his previous estimate of $6.10. 
<PERSON>Eli Lustgarten</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, who a couple of weeks ago reduced his 1989 estimate to $5.70 a share because of the weakening truck market, says he will make another cut to about $5.50 a share in light of the third-quarter report.
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>Eaton</ORGANIZATION> closed at $57.50 a share, down $2.50. 
Despite such famous tenants as oil magnate <PERSON>John D. Rockefeller</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Lake View Cemetery</LOCATION> has fallen on hard times.
The private, non-profit cemetery has had trouble competing against its for-profit counterparts, which use direct mail and other advertising to sell lots. "We don't want to be known as ambulance chasers," says <PERSON>William Garrison</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lake View</PERSON>'s president. "We want people to think of <LOCATION>Lake View</LOCATION> as an historical park and educational experience. . . . A pleasant place to come and spend a few hours." 
The oil magnate, who spent his later years passing out dimes to counter his penny-pinching image, "isn't terribly amusing," says <PERSON>Barry Olson</PERSON>, creative director at <ORGANIZATION>Innis-Maggiore-Olson</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Canton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, which is producing the ads.
But there are plenty of other promising prospects at <LOCATION>Lake View</LOCATION>, promoters believe: <PERSON>Ernest Ball</PERSON>, for instance, who wrote "When Irish Eyes are Smiling," and <PERSON>Garrett Morgan</PERSON>, the inventor of the gas mask and the tri-colored traffic light. 
Up to now, <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> has made a rapid-fire series of settlements with 25 states and the commonwealth of <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>.
Just yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION> announced it made a $75,000 settlement with <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION>, a record-tying fine for a securities-law matter in that state.
These states have been entering into settlements with <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> as part of the firm's efforts to operate freely anywhere in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> despite its record as an admitted felon. 
But individuals familiar with the generally successful <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> talks say the firm is meeting resistance from some big states, including <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> has to settle with state securities regulators in the wake of its criminal guilty plea and a related civil settlement with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> that includes payment of $650 million in penalties.
<LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>District of Columbia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> have been less resistant to <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> than the other six states, but nonetheless have refused to settle so far, say those familiar with the discussions. 
Securities regulators praise <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> for its energetic effort, led by government-approved general counsel <PERSON>Saul S. Cohen</PERSON>, to settle its legal problems with the states.
"There was a lot of internal debate about that specific issue," said <PERSON>Susan Bryant</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>'s chief securities regulator and president of the <ORGANIZATION>North American Securities Administrators Association</ORGANIZATION>, which drafted a voluntary settlement plan for the states with <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION>.
While <PERSON>Ms. Bryant</PERSON>'s state went ahead and accepted <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION>'s settlement offer of $25,000, she said: "I don't have any argument with those who came to different conclusions.
Similarly, <PERSON>Alfred Rubega</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION>'s director of securities regulation, said his state hadn't received any complaints about <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION>, so it really couldn't press the issue.
<PERSON>Mr. Cohen</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> general counsel, said, "I don't think, as we say in investment banking, that `by the end of the day' we'll be losing any licenses." Asked about states that are taking a hard line, he said, "There are states that have asked for additional information, which we are providing to them." 
<PERSON>Mr. Cohen</PERSON> said more than $2.8 million has been paid to 26 states and that <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> still expects to pay out a total of $11.5 million.
By the end of this week, <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> should have another three to four settlements, <PERSON>Mr. Cohen</PERSON> said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION>'s proposed state fines have been based on a state's population and on the size of <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION>'s business in the state. 
State officials won't describe their position in detail, but <PERSON>James McLelland Smith</PERSON>, state securities chief, said: "We really are still looking at it and have informed (<ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION>) that the proposal is really not sufficient for settlement." 
<LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> already has issued a "notice of intent" to revoke <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION>'s brokerage license.
It is one of the states that have met with <PERSON>Mr. Cohen</PERSON> and asked for additional information about investors' accounts and other matters. "This particular issue goes to the very integrity of the capital-formation market," state Banking Commissioner <PERSON>Howard Brown</PERSON> said.
Particularly touchy are the cases of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, which is <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION>'s base, and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, the base of <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION>'s highly profitable junk-bond operation that led to the firm's legal difficulties.
<PERSON>Ms. Bryant</PERSON>, the head of the state securities group, said <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> has done a better job of settling with the states than <PERSON>E.F. Hutton</PERSON> did after its guilty plea to a massive check-kiting scheme several years ago.
These are the 26 states, including the commonwealth of <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, that have settled with <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION>: <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>. 
Housing and <ORGANIZATION>Urban Development</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Jack Kemp</PERSON> called on the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve System</ORGANIZATION> to lower interest rates. 
In a speech to the <ORGANIZATION>Mortgage Bankers Association</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Kemp</PERSON> broke the administration's public silence on the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> and complained that "interest rates are too high." 
"I am convinced that a monetary policy for this country that would return interest rates to the historical level of 4% or 5% would have not only an immediate impact on housing starts, the housing stock, our industry in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, the refurbishing of our industrial system, it would help the Third World economies considerably and it would particularly have a favorable impact upon our budget deficit," <PERSON>Mr. Kemp</PERSON> said. 
The designer's attorney, <PERSON>Molly Bartholow</PERSON>, said that <PERSON>Ms. Garratt</PERSON> was forced to start bankruptcy-law proceedings because <PERSON>Jerell</PERSON> began withholding her royalty payments last month. 
<PERSON>Jerell</PERSON> paid <PERSON>Ms. Garratt</PERSON> royalties for the line known as Multiples by <PERSON>Sandra Garratt</PERSON>, which are sold primarily through department stores.
<PERSON>Ms. Garratt</PERSON> sued the <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> apparel maker earlier this year, charging that <PERSON>Jerell</PERSON> developed and marketed clothing lines fashioned after her designs, in violation of their contract.
Demand for ads also rose at the eight TV stations <ORGANIZATION>Capital Cities</ORGANIZATION> owns and at its 80%-owned <ORGANIZATION>ESPN</ORGANIZATION> sports cable channel. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Capital Cities</ORGANIZATION> closed at $558.50, down $5. 
Chairman <PERSON>Thomas S. Murphy</PERSON> cited <ORGANIZATION>Capital Cities</ORGANIZATION>' nine daily newspapers in explaining most of the gain.
Last week, <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> unseated <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>National Broadcasting Co.</ORGANIZATION> unit as the No. 1 network, as rated by <ORGANIZATION>A.C. Nielsen Co</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> has four shows in the top 10, including the top show, "<PERSON>Roseanne</PERSON>." 
<PERSON>Carlos A. Salvagni</PERSON>, vice president, pharmaceutical manufacturing, will assume responsibility for manufacturing in <LOCATION>Kalamazoo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, effective Nov. 1.
<PERSON>Mr. Salvagni</PERSON>, 53 years old, succeeds <PERSON>John C. Griffin</PERSON>, 57, who is retiring as corporate vice president of pharmaceutical manufacturing.
And in the second game, with <PERSON>Mr. Kasparov</PERSON> advancing ferociously as white, <LOCATION>D.T.</LOCATION> offered feeble resistance and lost even faster. 
His strategy against <ORGANIZATION>D.T.</ORGANIZATION> was based on a thorough study of dozens of its games, he said, including its notorious whippings of the grandmasters Bent <PERSON>Larsen</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Robert Byrne</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <PERSON>Mr. Kasparov</PERSON> was underwhelmed. "The computer's mind is too straight, too primitive," lacking the intuition and creativity needed to reach the top, he said. 
<ORGANIZATION>D.T.</ORGANIZATION> also has a prodigious and flawless memory, is utterly fearless, and couldn't be distracted by the sexy nude sculptures spread around the playing hall, in the <ORGANIZATION>New York Academy of Art</ORGANIZATION>.
In fact, <LOCATION>D.T.</LOCATION> never left home, <ORGANIZATION>Carnegie Mellon University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>, but communicated with its human handlers by telephone link.
They conceded that the odds favored <PERSON>Mr. Kasparov</PERSON>, but they put their hope in <LOCATION>D.T.</LOCATION>'s recently enhanced capacity for examining positions -- up to a million per second, from 720,000. 
Instead of castling, a standard measure to safeguard the king, <LOCATION>D.T.</LOCATION> made a second-rate rook maneuver at move 13; then it put a knight offside on move 16. "Only two classes of minds would think of this -- very weak human players, and computers," said <PERSON>Edmar Mednis</PERSON>, the expert commentator for the match, which was attended by hundreds of chess fans. 
It allowed <PERSON>Mr. Kasparov</PERSON> to exchange his dark-squared bishop for one of <ORGANIZATION>D.T.</ORGANIZATION>'s knights.
Bishops usually are worth slightly more than knights, but in this case <PERSON>Mr. Kasparov</PERSON> was left with a very dangerous knight and <ORGANIZATION>D.T.</ORGANIZATION>'s surviving bishop was reduced to passivity.
While <LOCATION>D.T.</LOCATION> shuffled its king back and forth in a defensive crouch, <PERSON>Mr. Kasparov</PERSON> maneuvered the knight to a dominant outpost.
<PERSON>Mr. Tannenbaum</PERSON> is a reporter in the Journal's <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> bureau. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> intensified its battle with <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> over <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar PLC</ORGANIZATION> by saying it is prepared to make a bid for all of the British auto maker when restrictions on its shareholding are lifted. 
The statement was part of a <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> filing with the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> didn't say how much it might offer for <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, or when.
But with its stake in <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, which it raised yesterday to 11.95%, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> could convene a special <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shareholders' meeting and urge holders to vote to drop the restriction sooner.
"We have not made that decision" to seek a <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> special shareholders' meeting, said <PERSON>Martyn Watkins</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
Last month, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> announced plans to acquire as much as 15% of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>.
Since then, <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> officials have confirmed that they are discussing an alliance with <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> and said last week that they hoped to reach an agreement within a month. 
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> seems to be losing interest in giving <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> a minority stake, said one individual close to the talks, adding, "It wouldn't surprise me if {<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> executives} want to wait and see what the color of that {<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> bid} is" first.
He predicted <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> officials will meet with <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> executives in the next week to outline their proposed offer.
Sir <PERSON>John Egan</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, so far has refused to meet with <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> officials, but he is believed to be willing to consider a specific bid proposal. 
As for <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>, its "fallback position has to be a full bid itself," said <PERSON>Stephen Reitman</PERSON>, European auto-industry analyst at <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> brokers <ORGANIZATION>UBS-Phillips & Drew</ORGANIZATION>.
A <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> takeover of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> would "have such implications for the balance of power in the 1990s that <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> can't afford to step aside.
A <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> spokesman yesterday reiterated the company's interest in acquiring a minority stake to help <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> remain independent. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> takeover-stock speculators now own an estimated 25% of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shares.
In a declining <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> stock market yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shares were down four pence from Monday in late trading, at 694 pence ($11.11) a share.
In the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s American depositary receipts rose 12.5 cents in over-the-counter trading, to $11.25. 
Both <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> badly need a luxury brand to combat new competition from the Japanese in the <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> markets.
The company has expressed a preference for <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> over <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> because <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> has promised it would keep <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> independent. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s need to acquire some or all of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> became more acute last week when it abandoned a four-year effort to market its German-built Merkur Scorpio sedan as a European luxury import in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Then, last Friday, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s talks about a possible alliance with <LOCATION>Saab-Scania</LOCATION> AB of <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> collapsed. 
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s interest in <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> reflects a desire to help diversify the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> company's products in the growing luxury-car segment of the market.
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> officials also see a lot of potential in marrying <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s cars to the technological know-how of <ORGANIZATION>Group Lotus PLC</ORGANIZATION>, a British engineering and specialty car maker <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> bought in 1986. 
<PERSON>William S. Leavitt</PERSON>, chairman, said <PERSON>Mr. Penn</PERSON>, 58 years old, would continue as a consultant and would work with the board in selecting a successor.
His father, <PERSON>David S. Leavitt</PERSON>, was chairman and chief executive until his death in an accident five years ago, at which time <PERSON>Mr. Penn</PERSON> was named president. 
<ORGANIZATION>Consumers Power</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Bechtel Power Corp.</ORGANIZATION> last year announced a joint venture to buy the plant, currently owned completely by the utility. 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s production of cars, trucks and buses in September fell 4.1% from a year ago to 1,120,317 units because of a slip in exports, the <ORGANIZATION>Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association</ORGANIZATION> said. 
<ORGANIZATION>National Environmental</ORGANIZATION> also said it will move its headquarters from <LOCATION>Hingham</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Folcroft</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, the site of its sludge dewatering facility.
<ORGANIZATION>National Environmental</ORGANIZATION>, formerly <ORGANIZATION>Yankee Cos.</ORGANIZATION>, is a sludge treatment company. 
New York-based <ORGANIZATION>Hearst Corp.</ORGANIZATION> this fall plans to publish its first issue of 9 Months, a magazine for expectant mothers, and has already launched <ORGANIZATION>American Home</ORGANIZATION>.
And <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner Inc.</ORGANIZATION> is developing a spinoff of <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION> magazine aimed at kids, on the heels of its successful Sports Illustrated for Kids. 
Over the past four years, the number of consumer magazines has increased by an average of 80 magazines annually, according to <PERSON>Donald Kummerfeld</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Magazine Publishers of America</ORGANIZATION>. "This is an impressive show of faith in the future of the magazine industry," said <PERSON>Mr. Kummerfeld</PERSON>. "Entrepreneurs don't rush to get into a stagnant or declining industry." 
Within the same nine months, <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> closed down In Fashion, a once-promising young woman's <ORGANIZATION>fashion magazine</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Drake Publications Inc.</ORGANIZATION> has folded the long-troubled <ORGANIZATION>Venture magazine</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Lang Communications</ORGANIZATION> has announced <PERSON>Ms. magazine</PERSON>, after 17 years, will no longer carry advertising as of January.
Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>American Health Partners</ORGANIZATION>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION>American Health magazine</ORGANIZATION>, is deep in debt, and <PERSON>Owen Lipstein</PERSON>, founder and managing partner, is being forced to sell the magazine to <ORGANIZATION>Reader's Digest Association Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Lipstein</PERSON>'s absence from the meeting here raised speculation that the sale is in trouble.
<PERSON>Mr. Lipstein</PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> that the sale was proceeding as planned. "The magazine is strong.
"Magazines can no longer be considered institutions," said <PERSON>James Autry</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Meredith Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's magazine group. "Publishers will find that some magazines have served their purpose and should die," he added. "Magazines could, like other brands, find that they have only a limited life." 
More than ever, independent magazines and small publishing groups are being gobbled up by larger publishing groups, such as <ORGANIZATION>American Express Publishing Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>American Express Co.</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Conde Nast Publications Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Advance Publications Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which are consolidating in order to gain leverage with advertisers. 
<PERSON>Gerry Ritterman</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>New York-based Network Publishing Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, earlier this year sold his <ORGANIZATION>Soap Opera Digest</ORGANIZATION> magazine to <PERSON>Rupert Murdoch</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>News Corp</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Ritterman</PERSON> said that in the next six months he will take $50 million from the <ORGANIZATION>Soap Opera Digest</ORGANIZATION> sale to acquire new magazines.
The estimates of real gross national product prepared by the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Economic Analysis</ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Commerce</ORGANIZATION> significantly understate the rate of economic growth.
I estimate that these mismeasurements as detailed by <PERSON>Martin N. Baily</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert J. Gordon</PERSON> add a further 0.12 percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate of real business product.

<PERSON>Mr. Fried</PERSON> also is the managing partner of <ORGANIZATION>Albert Fried & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
A #320 million ($508 million) <ORGANIZATION>British Airways PLC</ORGANIZATION> rights issue flopped badly -- the victim of recent market turbulence and the collapse of the buy-out bid for <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>' parent, <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> carrier had planned the issue to help finance its $750 million purchase of a 15% stake in <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>.
But <ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION> withdrew from the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> labor-management buy-out plan last Friday, after the group failed to get bank financing for its $6.79 billion buy-out. 
"It is close to being a record undersubscription," said <PERSON>Bob Bucknell</PERSON>, an analyst with <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> broker <ORGANIZATION>Smith New Court Securities</ORGANIZATION>. "Fund managers don't like to have rights issues that don't have an obvious reason.
The obvious reason was (for <ORGANIZATION>British Air</ORGANIZATION>) to buy a stake in <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>." 
In a statement, <ORGANIZATION>British Air</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Lord King</PERSON> said the company was "obviously disappointed that the issue was not taken up, but it would have been unreasonable to expect a better result given the volatility of the stock market since the launch of the issue." 
<PERSON>Lazard</PERSON> and other primary underwriters have reduced or eliminated their exposure by sub-underwriting the issue among <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> institutional investors. "The (paper) loss here is very small" for these sub-underwriters, observed <PERSON>John Nelson</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Lazard</ORGANIZATION> managing director.
And instead of buying the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stake, the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> carrier will be able to reduce its high debt level and build an acquisition war chest. "From a cash flow point of view, <ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION> is better off not being in <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION> in the short term," said <PERSON>Andy Chambers</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Nomura Research Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
For instance, <ORGANIZATION>British Air</ORGANIZATION> is continuing to negotiate with <ORGANIZATION>KLM Royal Dutch Airlines</ORGANIZATION> about each acquiring a 20% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Sabena World Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, the air transport subsidiary of the Belgian national airline.
In late trading on <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> yesterday, the shares were off three pence at 194 pence.
But <ORGANIZATION>British Air</ORGANIZATION>'s withdrawal from the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> buy-out could have further repercussions.
Some analysts speculated yesterday that the move has set off a board room split, which may lead to the resignation of Sir <PERSON>Colin Marshall</PERSON>, the carrier's chief executive officer. "The stories are rubbish," a <ORGANIZATION>British Air</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. "There is no difference of opinion between (Chairman) Lord King and <PERSON>Sir Colin</PERSON> on any aspect of company policy." 
<ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities</ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON>Leslie Steppel</PERSON> said reduced labor costs helped boost margins, although she doubted "that kind of performance is sustainable." Calling sales "still relatively soft," <PERSON>Ms. Steppel</PERSON> believes that in real terms, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales slipped 3 1/2% to 4% at company-operated stores in the quarter. 
Big gains for the ultra-right Republicans party in <LOCATION>Baden-Wuerttemburg</LOCATION> state municipal elections Sunday showed eroding support for Chancellor <PERSON>Helmut Kohl</PERSON> in a traditional bastion for his <ORGANIZATION>Christian Democratic Union</ORGANIZATION>. 
The left-of-center <ORGANIZATION>Social Democrats</ORGANIZATION> and the environmental <ORGANIZATION>Greens party</ORGANIZATION> posted mixed results. 
Headed by a former <ORGANIZATION>Waffen SS</ORGANIZATION> sergeant and working from a nationalistic platform of anti-foreigner rhetoric, the fledgling Republicans party has scored surprising gains in earlier elections in the states of <LOCATION>West Berlin</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hesse</PERSON> and <PERSON>North-Rhine Westphalia</PERSON>. 
Election analysts acknowledge that a "Red-Green" coalition of <ORGANIZATION>Social Democrats and Greens</ORGANIZATION> could edge out Chancellor <PERSON>Kohl</PERSON>'s coalition in the December 1990 national election if support for the Republicans continues to spread. 
"If we're not careful we could become known as a haven for war criminals," said <PERSON>Jeff Rooker</PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> and one of several British politicians attending a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> conference with government investigators from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. 
A parliamentary inquiry found in July that more than 70 people living in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> could have been part of death squads that roamed Nazi-occupied <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>.
British investigations were prompted by a list of 17 alleged war criminals living in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> sent to Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON> in October 1986 by the <ORGANIZATION>Simon Wiesenthal Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. 
In a sign of easing tension between <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> said it will again take back illegal immigrants caught crossing into the British colony.
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> had refused to repatriate citizens who sneaked into <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> illegally since early this month, when the colony allowed a dissident Chinese swimmer to flee to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
<LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> said it is investigating exports to the Soviet Union by an Ing.
Although <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s investigation of whether <PERSON>Olivetti</PERSON> had violated Western export-control rules had previously been made known, this marked the first time the unit and product were named.
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is worried about the convertibility of <PERSON>Olivetti</PERSON>'s machine tools to military use.
However, an <PERSON>Olivetti</PERSON> spokeswoman said OCN-PPL, of which <PERSON>Olivetti</PERSON> sold the majority interest last year, "doesn't make equipment that has the type of precision necessary for sophisticated productions." 
Earlier this year, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> said it would cut the number of its drift-net vessels in the <LOCATION>South Pacific</LOCATION> by two-thirds, or down to 20. 
Workers at <ORGANIZATION>Peugeot S.A.</ORGANIZATION>'s car plant at <LOCATION>Sochaux</LOCATION>, in eastern <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, voted to end a six-week-old strike that has cost the Peugeot group production of 60,000 automobiles, a company spokesman said.
The spokesman said the vote at <LOCATION>Sochaux</LOCATION> is expected to be followed by a similar move at the company's assembly plant at <LOCATION>Mulhouse</LOCATION>, where the number of strikers has been whittled down to 80. 
About 8,000 <ORGANIZATION>National Union of Mineworkers</ORGANIZATION> members resumed their strike against <ORGANIZATION>De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> after further negotiations to settle a wage dispute broke down.
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>People's Daily</ORGANIZATION> took note of the growing problem of computer fraud. 
Since the first fraud was discovered in July 1986 at an office of the <ORGANIZATION>People's Bank of China in Shenzhen</ORGANIZATION>, 15 major cases have been found, the paper said; the biggest was the theft of $235,000 from a bank in <LOCATION>Chengdu</LOCATION> in March 1988. 
Japanese tourists will be told to take care when photographing earthquake damage in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Japan Association of Travel Agents</ORGANIZATION> said.
The association issued an advisory to its 1,685 member agencies following a report from the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> that picture-taking by Japanese tourists in earthquake-stricken areas was causing ill feeling among local residents. . . . <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION>Lenin</LOCATION>'s tomb in Red Square will be closed from Nov. 10 to Jan. 15 for essential maintenance.
This <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, generic-drug maker announced a 5% stock dividend payable Dec. 15, to holders of record Nov. 15.
<PERSON>Jay Marcus</PERSON>, president, said the move "reflects the confidence of our board and management in <LOCATION>Halsey</LOCATION>'s long-term prospects and our desire to provide our shareholders with an attractive return on their investment." In <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>Halsey</ORGANIZATION> closed at $5.8125 a share, up 6.25 cents. 
Euro <ORGANIZATION>Disneyland</ORGANIZATION> shares made a debut like <PERSON>Snow White</PERSON> yesterday while most of the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> stock market looked like it had eaten the Evil Queen's poisoned apple. 
In its first day of when-issued trading here, <ORGANIZATION>Euro Disney</ORGANIZATION> soared like <PERSON>Dumbo</PERSON> to close at 814 pence ($13.05), up 15% from its 707-pence offering price.
Traders credited <ORGANIZATION>Euro Disney</ORGANIZATION>'s share performance to the tremendous hyping of the project that the shares are destined to help finance: <ORGANIZATION>Walt Disney Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's 4,800-acre theme park 20 miles east of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.
"The issue was very well-received -- Disney is such a well-known, you can say world-wide, name," said <PERSON>Vernon Dempsey</PERSON>, head trader of European equities at <ORGANIZATION>Kleinwort Benson Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, which is making a market in the issue. 
<PERSON>Mr. Dempsey</PERSON> estimated that the issue's <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> debut was accompanied by "very, very heavy turnover -- between five million and six million shares." Most of the buying was institutional, he added. 
Official trading in the shares will start in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> on Nov. 6, when the French-franc denominated offering, valued at the equivalent of nearly $1 billion, comes to market in the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>.
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> investors will be permitted to buy the shares from <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> investors 90 days later. 
In contrast to the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> performance, <ORGANIZATION>Euro Disney</ORGANIZATION> there closed down three francs yesterday, at 79 1/2 francs ($12.66) bid, but still about 10% over the 72-franc offering price. 
"A lot of people are getting hurt on this wicked whipsawing," cautioned <PERSON>Alistair Cuddeford</PERSON>, a London-based <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers International Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> trader who makes a market in franc-denominated Euro Disney shares. "There should be no great rush for investors to buy this.
Figures for the period ended Sept. 30 for the four largest brokerage firms -- <ORGANIZATION>Nomura Securities Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Daiwa Securities Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Yamaichi Securities Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Nikko Securities</ORGANIZATION> -- also reflected a changeover to a fiscal year ending March 31, replacing the 12-month term formerly finishing Sept. 30. 
<PERSON>Samuel Hall</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Howard University</ORGANIZATION>'s placement director, also doesn't see it.
And he questions the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> dedication. "I don't think the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration has done anything," he says.
Managers have "some very broad discretion," says an official at <ORGANIZATION>Walt Disney Co</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Unocal Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's top management sets guidelines, but line supervisors slice up the merit pie. 
<ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION> researchers find the companies earn more and win a bigger market share when their American employees get a voice in planning, product development and design, including decision-making back in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. "You can't hire competent Americans and say, `Let them run only their own show, '" says <PERSON>Vladimir Pucik</PERSON>, who headed the study run with <ORGANIZATION>Egon Zehnder International</ORGANIZATION>, a search firm. 
The researchers say many Japanese companies err in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> by adopting the American practice of hiring managers on the "open market." In <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, by contrast, companies tend to develop their own talent and promote from within.
<PERSON>Wafaa El-Sadr</PERSON>, who heads the AIDS program at <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Harlem Hospital Center</LOCATION>, can't find help. "I've been recruiting every single day since it's been identified that many AIDS patients come from the inner city," she says.
<ORGANIZATION>Parkland Memorial Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> says it hasn't had any problem recruiting, even after a nurse contracted the virus while injecting an AIDS patient. "I can tell you that nobody quit over it.
<ORGANIZATION>St. Paul Medical Center</ORGANIZATION>, also in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, sees only a "minimal erosion" of support staff due to AIDS. <LOCATION>Yale-New Haven Hospital</LOCATION> sees no problem, says <PERSON>John Fenn</PERSON>, the chief of staff. 
<PERSON>Shin Yonehara</PERSON>, a research scientist at the <ORGANIZATION>Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science</ORGANIZATION>, said the antibody he discovered works by recognizing an antigen called a Fas-antigen, which is characteristic of an infected cell.
<PERSON>Dr. Yonehara</PERSON> and his partner, <PERSON>Nobuyuki Kobayashi</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Yamaguchi University</ORGANIZATION>, said their experiments showed that the antibody wiped out an average of 60% of AIDS-infected cells within three days.
But <PERSON>Takashi Kitamura</PERSON>, director of the biology department at <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Institute of Health</ORGANIZATION> and secretary of the government's AIDS-research center, said, "I'm not so optimistic of its future use in therapeutic methods." He said some infected cells may not have the relevant antigen and so wouldn't be killed even after exposure to the antibody. 
But he and <PERSON>Dr. Yonehara</PERSON> said there were still several uncertainties, particularly regarding possible side effects. "Our antibody specifically killed infected cells at a very low dose, but it can also kill other cells," said <PERSON>Dr. Yonehara</PERSON>. "We don't know the effect of our antibody on the human body." 
<PERSON>Dr. Kitamura</PERSON> said about 35 projects are currently under way in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, and that Japanese researchers in the past year have made available three possible cures to <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> researchers for clinical tests.
<ORGANIZATION>Wellcome PLC</ORGANIZATION>, a major British pharmaceutical maker, sells the drug under the name <PERSON>Retrovir</PERSON>. 
A <ORGANIZATION>Wellcome</ORGANIZATION> spokesman declined to comment on the discovery of the antibody in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
But <PERSON>Andrew Porter</PERSON>, a drug-industry analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Nikko Securities Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, said if the product were to be successfully developed it would represent "a potential threat to the long-term viability of Retrovir." 
Stronger results from the company's broadcast and cable television units and professional and textbook publishing divisions, plus increased advertising at the company's largest newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Times</ORGANIZATION>, offset advertising declines in the company's newspapers in the <LOCATION>Eastern U.S.</LOCATION>, the company said. 
"Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the outlook for the newspaper group remains guarded, with no improvement yet seen in operating trends in our Eastern markets," said <PERSON>Robert F. Erburu</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Times Mirror</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive. 
The Des Moines-based publisher said it created a new <ORGANIZATION>Custom Marketing Group</ORGANIZATION> that will offer advertisers special rates for combination packages in its magazines, such as <ORGANIZATION>Ladies Home Journal</ORGANIZATION> and Better Homes and Gardens.
Earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION>Meredith</ORGANIZATION> sold its first such package for $3 million to <ORGANIZATION>Kraft Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, now a unit of New York-based <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris Cos</ORGANIZATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Kraft</ORGANIZATION> package included a specially published cookbook, a national free-standing insert in Sunday newspapers, and a <ORGANIZATION>Kraft</ORGANIZATION> "advertorial" section that ran in five Meredith magazines.
<PERSON>Bill Murphy</PERSON>, director of the new marketing unit, said <ORGANIZATION>Meredith</ORGANIZATION> is negotiating other large-scale packages with leading companies in several product categories, but he wouldn't disclose their names.
Sources close to the company and ad agencies that work with <PERSON>Meredith</PERSON> said leading advertisers in consumer electronics, packaged goods and automotive products were among those negotiating ad packages with the <ORGANIZATION>Meredith</ORGANIZATION> group. 
The <ORGANIZATION>New York Times Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Magazine Group</ORGANIZATION> earlier this year began offering advertisers extensive merchandising services built around buying ad pages in its <ORGANIZATION>Golf Digest magazine</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Time Warner Inc.</ORGANIZATION> recently formed a "synergy department" to seek out ways to offer advertisers packages that could combine Time's magazines with <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> products such as videocassettes. 
<PERSON>Paul DuCharme</PERSON>, director of media services at <ORGANIZATION>Grey Advertising</ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>Meredith</ORGANIZATION> is the leader in providing multimedia packages. "They may get passed up later when other publishers get their acts together, but for now they are the quickest offering the most extensive plan," he said. 
<PERSON>Mr. Murphy</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Meredith</ORGANIZATION> said one advertiser, which he wouldn't identify, wants Meredith to provide ad pages in seven <PERSON>Meredith</PERSON> magazines, publish an interior-decorating book that will be distributed at point of purchase, give away a videotape on installation pointers, and possibly use <ORGANIZATION>Meredith</ORGANIZATION>'s Better Homes and Gardens' residential real-estate agents to distribute discount-coupon books to new homeowners. 
While results were mixed in many states, "small business got by fairly well," concludes <PERSON>Don L. Robinson</PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Federation of Independent Business</ORGANIZATION>, the largest small-business organization. 
Five states -- <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> -- passed bills to boost the minimum wage, but measures in 19 other states were defeated.
The <ORGANIZATION>Illinois Legislature</ORGANIZATION> narrowly passed a parental-leave bill, which Gov. <PERSON>James Thompson</PERSON> vetoed, and <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> amended laws to require that employers pay for breast-cancer exams. 
"Those kinds of issues always keep coming back," says <PERSON>Robert Beckwith</PERSON>, who manages the <ORGANIZATION>Illinois Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>'s small-business office. 
Only two states -- <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> -- this year joined five others requiring private employers to grant leaves of absence to employees with newborn or adopted infants.
In 1990, the issue is expected to be especially close in <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>. 
"We'll be playing a lot of defense, especially in the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION>," says <PERSON>Jim Buente</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>NFIB</ORGANIZATION>. 
Council member <PERSON>Joy Picus</PERSON>, the measure's chief advocate, considers it part of a "pro-family policy" that makes <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> a leader in "humanizing the workplace." 
<ORGANIZATION>Wessels & Pautsch</ORGANIZATION>, a small St. Charles law firm, plans to mail 500 customers a list of its lawyers' new phone and fax numbers as well as updated <ORGANIZATION>Rolodex</ORGANIZATION> cards.
Even print-shop operator <PERSON>Clay Smith</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Naperville</LOCATION> won't discard his old supply. (He reports his business is up slightly from customers replacing old stock.) 
<PERSON>Lewis G. Rudnick</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> lawyer who represents franchisers, contends <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> is narrowly limiting -- rather than expanding -- opportunities for negotiating sales.
<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON>Timothy H. Fine</PERSON>, who represents franchisees, insists <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s cautiousness helps protect franchisees from crafty sales negotiators who push unlawful clauses. 
SMALL TALK: A new <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> law frees store owners of liability if a customer trips or otherwise gets hurt on the way to the restroom. . . . Only 4% of <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> small businesses surveyed say they've tested an employee or applicant for drug or alcohol use. . . . By 52%-36%, <ORGANIZATION>Tennessee NFIB</ORGANIZATION> members favor laws to limit foreign ownership of land and facilities in the state. 
<PERSON>Mr. McNair</PERSON>, 62 years old, will be succeeded by <LOCATION>L.M.</LOCATION> "Bud" <PERSON>Baker Jr.</PERSON>, 47, the parent's chief credit officer and head of its administration division.
In addition, on Jan. 1, <PERSON>Thomas A. Bennett</PERSON>, 52, will become vice chairman and chief operating officer of <LOCATION>Wachovia</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Wachovia Bank & Trust</ORGANIZATION>, filling a vacancy left by the retired <ORGANIZATION>Hans W. Wanders</ORGANIZATION> in April.
<PERSON>Mr. Bennett</PERSON> will continue as executive in charge of the <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> banking operation. 
<PERSON>Baker</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bennett</PERSON> have been elected directors of <LOCATION>Wachovia</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Wachovia Bank & Trust</ORGANIZATION> filling vacant seats on both boards. 
In the director post, <PERSON>Mr. Brown</PERSON>, 38 years old, succeeds <PERSON>Joseph W. Hibben</PERSON>, who retired from the board in August.
"It certainly wasn't a disaster, but it does show weakness" in some of the company's chief markets, said <PERSON>George Krug</PERSON>, a chemicals-industry analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Oppenheimer & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>Carbide</ORGANIZATION> closed at $24.50 a share, down 50 cents. 
The maker of animal health and nutrition products said the business, <PERSON>Creations Aromatiques</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Port Valais</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Woodside</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, is a division of its <ORGANIZATION>Mallinckrodt Inc.</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary and had sales of about $30 million for its most recent year. 
<ORGANIZATION>International Minerals</ORGANIZATION> said the sale will allow <LOCATION>Mallinckrodt</LOCATION> to focus its resources on its core businesses of medical products, specialty chemicals and flavors. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>Fireman</ORGANIZATION>'s closed at $35.50 a share, down 50 cents. 
Your Sept. 26 "Politics & Policy" article about <PERSON>William Bennett</PERSON>'s Emergency Drug Plan for <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> gives the impression that the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> has not been nor is actively involved.
The <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> is very supportive of and an active participant in <PERSON>Mr. Bennett</PERSON>'s initiative.
It was agreed at the outset of the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Drug Initiative that the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION>'s role would be to continue targeting the major drug traffickers through our <ORGANIZATION>National Drug Strategy</ORGANIZATION>.
The trial of <ORGANIZATION>Raful Edmond III</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> serves to highlight our efforts in this area and the results achieved through our excellent working relationship with the <ORGANIZATION>Drug Enforcement Administration</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Metropolitan Police Department</ORGANIZATION> (MPD). 
The <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION>'s role is to complement the <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> initiative through not only these major trafficking investigations, but also by providing a full range of services through various task forces and our contacts with local police squads handling drug-related crimes.
The <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> said it filed a lawsuit seeking more than $7.7 million from a <ORGANIZATION>Meredith Corp.</ORGANIZATION> unit on charges that the company defrauded the government on a contract to provide relocation services for federal employees. 
The suit, filed in federal trial court in <LOCATION>Des Moines</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION>Meredith</ORGANIZATION> is based, alleges that the diversified media company's relocation unit cheated the government by misrepresenting the value of government employees' homes.
<ORGANIZATION>Color Systems Technology Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, said its major creditor, <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Pension Trust</ORGANIZATION>, agreed to convert $11.8 million of debt owed into 25% of Color System's fully diluted common stock. 
The agreement also calls for <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Pension</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION>, to receive as much as 10% of <ORGANIZATION>Color Systems</ORGANIZATION>' fully diluted common stock, depending on the proceeds from the sale of the <ORGANIZATION>AEI Film Library</ORGANIZATION> and its receivables.
<ORGANIZATION>General Electric Pension</ORGANIZATION> took control of the 85-title library last month after <ORGANIZATION>Color Systems</ORGANIZATION> defaulted on the loan. 
<PERSON>Mr. Lodge</PERSON>, 48 years old, a former finance executive at <ORGANIZATION>Singer Sewing Machine Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Celanese Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, succeeds <PERSON>Francis L. Brophy</PERSON>, 64, who plans to retire from the company next year. 
Early yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Carnival</ORGANIZATION> said in a company statement that it had been "notified unofficially" that <ORGANIZATION>Waertsilae Marine Industries</ORGANIZATION>, the Finnish shipyard that is building its three new cruise ships, planned to file for bankruptcy.
"There is just a tremendous amount of uncertainty about what the effect, if any, of all this is," said <PERSON>John P. Uphoff</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Raymond James Associates Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "I didn't even know that a company in a socialistic country could file for bankruptcy." 
<ORGANIZATION>Carnival</ORGANIZATION> said the "Fantasy," the first of the three $200 million ships that <ORGANIZATION>Carnival</ORGANIZATION> has on order, is scheduled to be delivered next month, just in time for the winter tourist season in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>.
"There's a 99% chance that the Fantasy will be delivered close to schedule," said <PERSON>Caroline Levy</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "The others will probably be delivered as well, but <ORGANIZATION>Carnival</ORGANIZATION> will likely have to pay a higher price for them." She said the company could pay as much as 25% more for the ships. 
According to reports from <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Waertsilae Marine</ORGANIZATION>, 19%-owned by conglomerate <ORGANIZATION>Oy Waertsilae</ORGANIZATION>, filed for bankruptcy yesterday after the shipyard's contractors had started to demand bank guarantees.
Ramada Inc.</ORGANIZATION> revised the terms of its restructuring and extended to Feb. 28, 1990, the deadline to complete the sale of its hotel business to <ORGANIZATION>New World Development Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Prime Motor Inns Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Fairfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J. 
Under the new terms, <LOCATION>New World</LOCATION> will still pay $540 million for <ORGANIZATION>Ramada</ORGANIZATION>'s hotel business, subject to adjustment at closing, but <ORGANIZATION>Ramada</ORGANIZATION> will now reimburse <ORGANIZATION>New World</ORGANIZATION> for $10 million in expenses.
Revised terms call for each <LOCATION>Ramada</LOCATION> common share to be exchanged for $1 in cash, subject to possible reduction, and one share of <LOCATION>Aztar</LOCATION> common stock.
<ORGANIZATION>Ramada</ORGANIZATION>'s stock rose 87.5 cents on the news to close at $11.25 in composite <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> trading.
One major advantage of the revised plan is that <ORGANIZATION>Aztar</ORGANIZATION> will have far less debt than under the old terms. "They'll go from being one of the most leveraged to one of the least leveraged casino companies," said <PERSON>Daniel Lee</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Lee</PERSON> values the package at between $15 and $20 a share, based on current trading prices of other casino-company stocks. 
The much-revised restructuring, which was first announced in October 1988, must again be approved by shareholders and state casino regulators in <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>.
In May, <ORGANIZATION>Ramada</ORGANIZATION> sold its <ORGANIZATION>Marie Callender Pie Shops Inc.</ORGANIZATION> unit to a group of private investors as part of its plan to focus on its casinos in <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION> and in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Laughlin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev</LOCATION>. 
"Some retail accounts, such as commercial banks and pension funds, wanted to get on the bandwagon before it was too late," said <PERSON>Sung Won Sohn</PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION>Norwest Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>. 
At one point, the <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones Industrial</ORGANIZATION> average fell about 80 points on news that <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION> decided to remain independent.
According to a trader at <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the hardest hit junk bonds were those issued by <ORGANIZATION>RJR Holdings Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which are the easiest to sell.
Trading activity in the junk market was extremely light as dealers couldn't find enough buyers to match sellers. "While the stock market was falling, most {junk bond holders} were just watching it not knowing what to do," said <PERSON>Paul Suckow</PERSON>, director of fixed-income securities at <ORGANIZATION>Oppenheimer Management Corp.</ORGANIZATION> "It was like driving down the highway watching a wreck.
Adding to the junk market's jitters were reports that <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.</ORGANIZATION> is having trouble structuring a $1.6 billion offering for <ORGANIZATION>TW Food Services Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and will postpone or even cancel the issue.
"It's not too surprising that the auction was sloppy, given the volatility in the bond market because of stocks," said <PERSON>Robert T. McGee</PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Tokai Bank Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> "People are looking past supply to lower interest rates, but they're also worried about being whipsawed by the volatility in the stock market." 
"Interest by Japanese investors was limited," said <PERSON>Michael Moran</PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION>Daiwa Securities America Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "They are typically not active in two-year note auctions, but today's participation could be viewed as lighter-than-normal." 
However, <PERSON>Mr. Moran</PERSON> added that the Japanese generally have a positive view of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> bond market because of expectations that the dollar will remain strong and interest rates will decline.
The discount rate on three-month <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bills was quoted at 7.52% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.75%, while the rate on six-month <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bills was quoted at 7.47% for a yield of 7.85%. 
Three of the largest offerings, by <ORGANIZATION>Exxon Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Xerox Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>, were underwritten by groups led by <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Exxon Capital</ORGANIZATION>, long-rumored to be a potential debt issuer, offered $200 million of 10-year notes priced to yield 8.31%.
<ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> issued $200 million of seven-year notes priced to yield 8.82%, and <ORGANIZATION>Xerox</ORGANIZATION> priced $150 million of six-year notes to yield 8.85%. 
Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION> paved the way for a visit to the credit markets by filing a shelf registration with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> for $800 million in new debt.
The <ORGANIZATION>Ginnie Mae</ORGANIZATION> 9% issue was yielding 9.34% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> 10-year note held at 1.46 percentage points. 
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s 11 3/4% <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bond due 2003/2007 rose 17/32 to 112 6/32 to yield 10.05%, while the 12% notes due 1995 rose 11/32 to 104 2/32 to yield 10.93%. 
He heads <ORGANIZATION>Litigation Sciences Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest legal consulting firm, which is helping corporate <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> prepare for high-stakes litigation by predicting and shaping jurors' reactions.
Little known outside the legal world but a powerhouse within, <ORGANIZATION>Litigation Sciences</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi & Saatchi PLC</ORGANIZATION>, employs more than 100 psychologists, sociologists, marketers, graphic artists and technicians.
Recently, <ORGANIZATION>Litigation Sciences</ORGANIZATION> helped <ORGANIZATION>Pennzoil Co.</ORGANIZATION> win a $10.5 billion jury verdict against <ORGANIZATION>Texaco Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
It advised the <ORGANIZATION>National Football League</ORGANIZATION> in its largely successful defense of antitrust charges by the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> Football League.
And it helped win defense verdicts in product-liability suits involving scores of products, ranging from <LOCATION>Firestone</LOCATION> 500 tires to the anti-nausea drug <PERSON>Bendectin</PERSON>.
Litigation consulting is, as <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> trial attorney <PERSON>Donald Zoeller</PERSON> puts it, "highly manipulative." He adds, "The notion they try to sell is that juries don't make decisions rationally.
Others complain that the consultants' growing influence exacerbates the advantage of litigants wealthy enough to afford such pricey services. "The affluent people and the corporations can buy it, the poor radicals {in political cases} get it free, and everybody in between is at a disadvantage, and that's not the kind of system we want," says <PERSON>Amitai Etzioni</PERSON>, a prominent sociologist who teaches at <ORGANIZATION>George Washington University</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Harrisburg</ORGANIZATION> 7 trial in 1972, in which <PERSON>Daniel Berrigan</PERSON> and others were charged with plotting anti-war-related violence, was a landmark. 
The researchers discovered that <PERSON>Episcopalians</PERSON>, Presbyterians, <ORGANIZATION>Methodists</ORGANIZATION> and fundamantalist Protestants were nearly always against the defendants; the lawyers resolved to try to keep them off the jury. 
The problem for <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> trial lawyers <PERSON>Thomas Barr</PERSON> and <PERSON>David Boies</PERSON> was how to make such a highly technical case understandable.
<PERSON>Boies</PERSON> and <PERSON>Barr</PERSON>, who had the chance to tilt their next day's presentation accordingly.
<PERSON>Mr. Vinson</PERSON>, the professor, got the law bug and formed <ORGANIZATION>Litigation Sciences</ORGANIZATION>. (<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> won the case.) 
"The hardest thing in any complex case is to retain objectivity and, in some sense, your ignorance," says <PERSON>Mr. Boies</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Cravath</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Swaine & Moore</ORGANIZATION>. "What you look for in a shadow jury is very much what you do when you give an opening argument to your wife or a friend and get some response to it.
The approach worked well in the recent antitrust case in which <ORGANIZATION>Energy Transportation Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION> sued <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> over the transport of semi-liquefied coal -- the kind of case likely to make almost anyone's eyes glaze over. 
<ORGANIZATION>Energy Transportation</ORGANIZATION> retained <ORGANIZATION>Litigation Sciences</ORGANIZATION>, at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars, to poll, pre-try, profile and shadow.
"It's just like weather forecasting," says <ORGANIZATION>Energy Transportation</ORGANIZATION> trial attorney <PERSON>Harry Reasoner</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Vinson & Elkins</ORGANIZATION>. "It's often wrong, but it's better than consulting an <LOCATION>Indian</LOCATION> rain dancer." 
They are very visually sophisticated," explains <ORGANIZATION>LSI</ORGANIZATION> graphics specialist <PERSON>Robert Seltzer</PERSON>. 
Supporters acknowledge that the process aims to manipulate, but they insist that the best trial lawyers have always employed similar tactics. "They may not have been able to articulate it all, but they did it," says <PERSON>Stephen Gillers</PERSON>, a legal ethics expert at <ORGANIZATION>New York University</ORGANIZATION> law school. "What you have here is intuition made manifest." 
Some litigators scoff at the notion that a sociologist knows more than they do about what makes a jury tick. "The essence of being a trial lawyer is understanding how people of diverse backgrounds react to you and your presentation," says <PERSON>Barry Ostrager</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Simpson Thacher & Bartlett</ORGANIZATION>, who recently won a huge case on behalf of insurers against <ORGANIZATION>Shell Oil Co</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Boies</PERSON>, the first lawyer to use <PERSON>Mr. Vinson</PERSON>'s services, cautions against courts' allowing extensive jury questioning (known as voir dire) or giving out personal information about the jurors. "The more extensive the voir dire, the easier you make it for that kind of research to be effective, and I don't think courts should lend themselves to that," <PERSON>Mr. Boies</PERSON> says.

Next to <PERSON>Kohlberg Kravis Roberts</PERSON>'s megabillion <ORGANIZATION>RJR Nabisco</ORGANIZATION> deal, <ORGANIZATION>SCI Television</ORGANIZATION> is small fry. 
The cable and TV station company was an <ORGANIZATION>LBO</ORGANIZATION> of an <ORGANIZATION>LBO</ORGANIZATION>, a set of assets that were leveraged twice, enabling the blue-chip buy-out king <PERSON>Henry Kravis</PERSON> in 1987 to take more than $1 billion of cash out of the com- pany. 
<ORGANIZATION>SCI TV</ORGANIZATION>'s buy-out was an ace in the hole for <PERSON>Mr. Kravis</PERSON> and for investors in <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> partnerships.
But it has left holders of <ORGANIZATION>SCI TV</ORGANIZATION>'s junk bonds holding the bag, including some heavyweights that <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> might need to finance future deals, such as <ORGANIZATION>Kemper Financial Services</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Savings & Loan</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Prudential Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. 
Some junk-holders are said to be considering legal action against <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> or moves to force <ORGANIZATION>SCI</ORGANIZATION> TV into bankruptcy court.
And <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION>'s majority partner in <ORGANIZATION>SCI TV</ORGANIZATION>'s buy-out, <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, entrepreneur <PERSON>George Gillett</PERSON>, also is said to be very unhappy. 
<ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> loaded up the cable and television company with debt in an 1985 buy-out, then later sold <PERSON>Storer</PERSON>'s cable operations at a fat profit. 
In 1987, <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> for the second time piled debt onto <PERSON>Storer</PERSON>'s TV stations, selling them for $1.3 billion to a new entity that was 45%-owned by <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> and 55%-owned by <ORGANIZATION>Gillett Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which now operates the <ORGANIZATION>SCI</ORGANIZATION> TV stations.
In this second <ORGANIZATION>LBO</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> with one hand took more than $1 billion of cash out of the TV company's assets and moved it into the Storer cable operations, making them more valuable in a 1988 sale. (<ORGANIZATION>Storer</ORGANIZATION> also took $125 million of junior <ORGANIZATION>SCI</ORGANIZATION> TV bonds as partial payment for the TV assets.) 
With the other hand, <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> put back into SCI TV less than 10% of the cash it had taken out, buying <ORGANIZATION>SCI TV</ORGANIZATION> common and preferred shares. 
So, while <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> today has an estimated $250 million sunk in now-shaky SCI TV, including equity and debt, the <ORGANIZATION>LBO</ORGANIZATION> firm still is $1 billion ahead on the <ORGANIZATION>SCI</ORGANIZATION> TV buy-out after taking cash up front.
On <PERSON>Storer</PERSON> as a whole, <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> racked up compound annual returns of 60% in the three years it owned Storer. 
Meanwhile, <PERSON>Mr. Gillett</PERSON> risks losing his entire equity investment of about $100 million in <ORGANIZATION>SCI</ORGANIZATION> TV if the company can't be restructured.
Overall, <PERSON>Mr. Gillett</PERSON>'s holding company, <ORGANIZATION>Gillett Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, is heavily indebted and, except for its <ORGANIZATION>Vail Mountain</ORGANIZATION> resorts, isn't doing very well. 
Negotiations "have started con- structively, but that's not to say we like this particular offer," says <ORGANIZATION>Wilbur Ross of Rothschild Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, adviser to <ORGANIZATION>SCI</ORGANIZATION> TV junk-holders. 
But it's understood that <PERSON>Mr. Kravis</PERSON> is disappointed that <PERSON>Mr. Gillett</PERSON> didn't manage to boost SCI TV's operating profit after the buy-out.
<PERSON>Mr. Kravis</PERSON> apparently thinks SCI TV can survive if lenders extend its debt payments until TV stations rise in value again, allowing <ORGANIZATION>SCI TV</ORGANIZATION> to sell assets to pay debt.
<PERSON>Mr. Gillett</PERSON> is said to be proud of his operating record; he has lifted some stations' ratings and turned around a <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> station. 
The bonds of <ORGANIZATION>SCI</ORGANIZATION> TV now are being quoted at prices ranging from only five cents to about 60 cents on the dollar, according to <ORGANIZATION>R.D. Smith & Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, which trades distressed securities. 
People who have seen <ORGANIZATION>SCI TV</ORGANIZATION>'s restructuring plan say it offers concessions by <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Gillett Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
They would both give part of their combined $50 million in common equity in <ORGANIZATION>SCI</ORGANIZATION> TV to holders of <ORGANIZATION>SCI TV</ORGANIZATION>'s $488 million of junk bonds, as a carrot to persuade them to accept new bonds that might reduce the value of their claims on the company. 
They add that it isn't costing <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> anything to give up equity because of its big up-front cash profit on the buy-out, which they think contributed to <ORGANIZATION>SCI</ORGANIZATION> TV's current problems.
<PERSON>Kemper</PERSON>, the biggest holder of senior <ORGANIZATION>SCI</ORGANIZATION> TV bonds, has refused to join the bond-holders committee and is said to be reviewing its legal options. 
To protect their claims, some junk-holders want <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> and perhaps <PERSON>Mr. Gillett</PERSON> to invest new money in <ORGANIZATION>SCI</ORGANIZATION> TV, perhaps $50 million or more.
Junk-holders say they have a stick to beat <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> with: "The threat of bankruptcy is a legitimate tool" to extract money from <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION>, says one big SCI TV holder.
A big bankruptcy-court case might tarnish <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION>'s name, and provide new fuel for critics of LBOs in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and elsewhere.
While <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> doesn't control SCI TVwhich is unusual for a <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> investment -- it clearly has much deeper pockets than <PERSON>Mr. Gillett</PERSON>.
Bankruptcy specialists say <PERSON>Mr. Kravis</PERSON> set a precedent for putting new money in sour LBOs recently when <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> restructured foundering Seaman Furniture, doubling <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION>'s equity stake. 
But with <PERSON>Seaman</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> was only trying to salvage its original investment, says bankruptcy investor <PERSON>James Rubin</PERSON> of <PERSON>Sass Lamle Rubin</PERSON> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
By contrast, <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> probably has already made all the money it can on <ORGANIZATION>SCI</ORGANIZATION> TV.
The <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION> computer systems and services concern said the offer is required under the senior note indenture as a result of <ORGANIZATION>Control Data</ORGANIZATION>'s recent sale of its disk drive subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION>Imprimis</ORGANIZATION>, to <ORGANIZATION>Seagate Technology Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
One award is part of a <ORGANIZATION>Department of Defense</ORGANIZATION> contract to <ORGANIZATION>Loral Rolm Mil-Spec Computers</ORGANIZATION> and could be valued at more than $100 million over five years.
"The company's on a roll," said <PERSON>Robert Herwick</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Hambrecht & Quist</ORGANIZATION>. "No other {computer} vendor offers graphics performance that good for their price." 
In the battle to supply desktop computers for researchers and design engineers, most of the attention is given to the biggest competitors: <ORGANIZATION>Sun Microsystems Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which make computers mainly aimed at a wide range of engineering and scientific needs. 
Though Silicon Graphics is much smaller than <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Hewlett</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Sun</ORGANIZATION>, it has emerged in recent years as a feared adversary in this graphics portion of the workstation market. 
<ORGANIZATION>Silicon Graphics</ORGANIZATION> also plans to unveil even less expensive machines in the near future. "It's pretty safe to assume we can bring the cost down of these systems by 30% to 40% a year," said <PERSON>Edward McCracken</PERSON>, the company's chief executive officer. 
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>'s announcement, which was expected and will formally be made to customers today, also marks an attempt to gain credibility on the plant floor, where <ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment Corp.</ORGANIZATION> has long dominated and where <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard Co.</ORGANIZATION> has recently gained market share. 
Consultants have said that it will take a while for all the pieces of the <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> strategy to fall into place, even though the specific products <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> unveiled will generally be available by the end of the first quarter. 
<PERSON>Sam Albert</PERSON>, a consultant in <LOCATION>Scarsdale</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, said that in the past <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> has developed broad software strategies only for problems that crossed industry lines.
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>'s manufacturing staff also will be able to provide software that <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> has developed internally and will be able to form teams with a customer to jointly solve manufacturing problems. 
"We may not have every manufacturing problem, but we have most," said <PERSON>George Conrades</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>'s top marketing official. 
The management turnover at <ORGANIZATION>Reebok International Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> continued with the resignation of company president <PERSON>C. Joseph LaBonte</PERSON>, who joined <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION> just two years ago. 
<PERSON>Mr. LaBonte</PERSON>'s departure follows by two months the resignation of <PERSON>Mark Goldston</PERSON> as senior vice president and chief marketing officer after only 11 months at <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION>. 
The resignations by the two executives, considered hard-charging and abrasive by <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION> insiders, reflect a difference in style with <PERSON>Paul Fireman</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive, according to several former executives.
The changes come as <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION>, which grew rapidly in the mid-1980s but has seen its sales flatten of late, is seeking to regain momentum in the athletic-shoe business against rivals <ORGANIZATION>Nike Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>L.A. Gear Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
The departures, said <PERSON>Alice Ruth</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Montgomery Securities</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, should enable the company to focus on business issues instead of management differences. "I think it's more an issue of style.
<ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Mr. LaBonte</PERSON> will resume the presidency of <ORGANIZATION>Vantage Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a California-based venture capital firm that he founded in 1983.
Before that he was president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION>Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION> added that <PERSON>Mr. Fireman</PERSON> will assume the title of president. 
A spokesman said that neither <PERSON>Mr. Fireman</PERSON> nor <PERSON>Mr. LaBonte</PERSON> would be available for comment. "We will not be commenting beyond the news release," the spokesman said. 
<PERSON>Mr. Goldston</PERSON>, who had been president of <ORGANIZATION>Faberge Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Faberge U.S.A.</ORGANIZATION> division before joining <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION> in September 1988, left in August to pursue other interests. 
<ORGANIZATION>Computer Associates</ORGANIZATION> closed at $13.625, down 25 cents, in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 
The board's decision, announced after the market closed Monday, initially prompted a severe sell-off in <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> shares, which at midday traded as low as $145 a share, down $33 a share, in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 
But then steady, concentrated buying by <ORGANIZATION>Bear, Stearns & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which frequently buys stock for corporate raiders, took hold and steadied the fall in <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>, which eventually buoyed the entire market.
Late in the afternoon, several big purchases by Bear, <PERSON>Stearns</PERSON>, particularly a block of 200,000 shares at 2:43 p.m. at $150 a share, triggered a buying spree that took <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> up more than 18 points in the final hour of trading. 
The two most frequently rumored buyers, neither of whom would comment, were <ORGANIZATION>Coniston Partners</ORGANIZATION>, which battled the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> board in 1987, and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> real estate developer <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>, who recently made and withdrew an offer for <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION>AMR Corp</ORGANIZATION>. However, one person familiar with <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> said the signs pointed to <ORGANIZATION>Coniston</ORGANIZATION> because <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> hasn't asked for permission to buy more than $15 million of stock under federal antitrust rules. 
<PERSON>Baker</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Nye Investments</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> takeover-stock trader that owns <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stock, wouldn't comment on reports the firm is considering seeking such a shareholder vote.
In 1986, <PERSON>Baker</PERSON>, <PERSON>Nye</PERSON> waged a proxy fight for control of <ORGANIZATION>Leaseway Transportation Inc.</ORGANIZATION> that ultimately led to <ORGANIZATION>Leaseway</ORGANIZATION>'s being sold. 
Some traders pointed hopefully to earlier estimates by <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>'s investment adviser, <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, that recapitalizations could yield $245 to $280 a share.
Any investor who acquires <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stock in an attempt to force a buy-out or recapitalization must deal with <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION>'s contentious unions.
But the board's decision prompted many to bail out of the stock yesterday. "We had a lot of people who threw in the towel today," said <PERSON>Earl Ellis</PERSON>, a partner in <ORGANIZATION>Benjamin Jacobson & Sons</ORGANIZATION>, a specialist in trading <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stock on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>. 
Another trader noted that many arbitrage firms are afraid to sell their <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stock at the bottom, but already own so much they can't buy any more. "This deal is like a <PERSON>Roach Motel</PERSON>," he said. "They check in, but they can't check out." 
Some investors whose names were bandied about by traders as potential <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stock buyers said they weren't buying. "I'm not interested," said <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Harold Simmons</PERSON>.
A source close to <PERSON>Carl Icahn</PERSON>, a corporate raider who owns <ORGANIZATION>Trans World Airlines Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said he hasn't owned any <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stock and isn't buying. 
One person familiar with <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON>Robert Bass</PERSON> said he isn't likely to make any hostile moves.
And a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Reliance Group Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which had held 7% of <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> before the first buy-out bid but later reduced its holdings below 5%, wouldn't comment. 
<PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON>, whose $5.4 billion takeover bid originally put the nation's second-largest airline in play, is limited by a standstill agreement with <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> he signed in September.
The <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> investor can't buy <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stock, solicit shareholder consents or make a new offer unless he makes a formal offer of $300 a share or <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> accepts an offer below $300. 
<ORGANIZATION>MCI Communications Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it received a $12 million contract to provide virtual network services to <ORGANIZATION>Woolworth Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's 5,600 corporate and retail sites in the 
<PERSON>Woolworth</PERSON> said it expects to expand usage of the <ORGANIZATION>MCI</ORGANIZATION> services as it adds about 6,000 business locations over the next few years. 
The conference, held in <LOCATION>Lower Silesia</LOCATION>, was co-sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>Environment Ministry</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Rockefeller Brothers Fund</ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION>Polish Ecological Club</ORGANIZATION>, and was attended by 50 Poles from government and industry, as well as Hungarians, Czechs, Russians, Japanese and Americans. 
The conference was entitled "Economic Mechanisms for <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection</ORGANIZATION>," a significant departure from <ORGANIZATION>East Bloc</ORGANIZATION> usage, which recognizes only one economic mechanism -- central planning -- to direct industrial behavior.
According to a detailed report by <PERSON>Zbigniew Bochniarz</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Minnesota</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Hubert Humphrey Institute</ORGANIZATION>, 27 areas containing a third of <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>'s population are regarded as "ecological hazards" due to multiple violations of standards.
<LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> produces about 20 times more soot and five times more sulfur dioxide and solid waste per unit of gross national product than does <LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION>.
One participant prematurely declared that <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> has had a free market in goods but a planned economy for environmental protection, while <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> represents the opposite.
His point: It will be increasingly difficult for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> to cling to command-and-control measures if even the <LOCATION>East Bloc</LOCATION> steps to a different drummer. 
At the moment, <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> resembles 19th-century <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> more than a modern industrial society -- with antiquated production, inadequate environmental management, and little ecological awareness.
<PERSON>Mr. Levin</PERSON>, former head of <ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION>'s regulatory reform staff, adapted this from his November column for the <ORGANIZATION>Journal of the Air</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Waste Management Association</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Weyerhaeuser Co.</ORGANIZATION> said it sold its wall-paneling business to an affiliate of one of <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>'s largest wood-products firms. 
<PERSON>Weyerhaeuser</PERSON> said its paneling business employs about 300 workers at two facilities in <LOCATION>Chesapeake</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Hancock</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Vt</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Manville Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it will build a $24 million power plant to provide electricity to its <LOCATION>Igaras</LOCATION> pulp and paper mill in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Asarco</ORGANIZATION> said the gain reflected continued strength in prices for refined copper, lead and zinc, and higher equity earnings in <LOCATION>Mexico Desarrollo Industrial Minero S.A.</LOCATION>, a Mexican mining company in which <ORGANIZATION>Asarco</ORGANIZATION> has a 34% stake.
In August, <ORGANIZATION>Asarco</ORGANIZATION>, through its Lac d'Amiante du Quebec subsidiary, sold its remaining one-third interest in an asbestos mining limited partnership in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> for $11.7 million.
<ORGANIZATION>Asarco</ORGANIZATION> said it plans to shut down or sell its <ORGANIZATION>Rapatee</ORGANIZATION> coal mine and will end its involvement in southern <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> strip mining.
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>Asarco</ORGANIZATION> fell $1.375 to close at $31.75. 
You quote <PERSON>Robert Crandall</PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION>American</LOCATION>'s parent, <ORGANIZATION>AMR Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, as having said that discount deals for big customers would be "dumb" because "you will go to <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> because you have to go to <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> whether the fare is $175, $275 or $375." 
In 1986, he settled an antitrust suit based on a taped telephone conversation of him proposing to <PERSON>Braniff</PERSON>'s president that they both raise fares 20%. (<PERSON>Braniff</PERSON> declined).
When I asked <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION> for its side of the story for use in my <ORGANIZATION>MBA</ORGANIZATION> class, where I teach business ethics, it did not respond.
The open-year accounting practice "is widely recognized within <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> as of serious concern" to the 31,329 member investors, who underwrite insurance at <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> in return for premium and investment income, <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> said.
<PERSON>William Kaiser</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Kaiser Financial Group</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, said the decline was almost certainly influenced by the early sell-off in the stock market, which partly reflected a weakening economy.
<PERSON>Betty Raptopoulos</PERSON>, senior metals analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, agreed that most of the selling was of a technical nature.
<PERSON>Ms. Raptopoulos</PERSON> said the settling of strikes in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> will have little effect on supplies of copper until early next year.
However, <PERSON>David Threlkeld</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Threlkeld & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, an international metals company, noted that so far this year copper consumption is way ahead of the same period of 1988, and that projected production is below last year. 
Prices for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> benchmark <LOCATION>West Texas</LOCATION> Intermediate crude remained locked in a fairly narrow range before ending the session four cents lower at $19.72 a barrel for December delivery.
The sale to the <LOCATION>Chinese</LOCATION> government of 330,000 metric tons of wheat under the government's export enhancement program was announced after the close of trading Monday, but the sale was expected and failed to buoy prices yesterday, said <PERSON>Dale Gustafson</PERSON>, a futures analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>.
As for other export customers, the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> isn't expected to be back buying <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> corn in significant amounts until early next year, he said.
<PERSON>Robert Hafer</PERSON>, senior commodities analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Kaiser Financial Group</ORGANIZATION>, said Monday's rally continued yesterday for only about 20 minutes after the opening.
<ORGANIZATION>Arthur Burns</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Board</ORGANIZATION> chairman, said the government's "luck" in keeping the bank open -- despite being the then-biggest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> bank failure -- prevented "shock waves around the country and around the world." Federal officials who had been probing the bank for months arranged a merger with <ORGANIZATION>European-American Bank & Trust</ORGANIZATION>, owned by six foreign banks, to avert the closedown.
In June 1980, <PERSON>Michele Sindona</PERSON> -- an Italian financier who in July 1972 had bought a 22% block of <LOCATION>Franklin</LOCATION>'s stock from <ORGANIZATION>Loews Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, headed by <PERSON>Laurence A. Tisch</PERSON> -- was sentenced to 25 years in prison after being convicted of fraud and perjury.
Included was the charge that <LOCATION>Sindona</LOCATION> siphoned $45 million of <LOCATION>Franklin</LOCATION> funds for his other ventures. (<LOCATION>Sindona</LOCATION> in 1979 faked his "kidnapping" for 2 1/2 months to delay his trial.) 
<LOCATION>Sindona</LOCATION>, the onetime <LOCATION>Vatican</LOCATION> financial adviser with reported links to the Mafia, died on March 22, 1986, at age 65, reportedly after drinking cyanide-laced coffee in an Italian prison.
<PERSON>Ronald B. Koenig</PERSON>, 55 years old, was named a senior managing director of the <ORGANIZATION>Gruntal & Co.</ORGANIZATION> brokerage subsidiary of this insurance and financial-services firm.
<PERSON>Mr. Koenig</PERSON> will build the corporate-finance and investment-banking business of <ORGANIZATION>Gruntal</ORGANIZATION>, which has primarily been a retail-based firm.
He was chairman and co-chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co.</ORGANIZATION> until July, when he was named co-chairman of the investment-banking firm along with <PERSON>Howard L. Blum Jr.</PERSON>, who then became the sole chief executive.
Yesterday, <PERSON>Mr. Blum</PERSON>, 41, said he wasn't aware of plans at <LOCATION>Ladenburg</LOCATION> to name a co-chairman to succeed <PERSON>Mr. Koenig</PERSON> and said the board would need to approve any appointments or title changes.
<PERSON>Mr. Blum</PERSON> added he wasn't surprised <PERSON>Mr. Koenig</PERSON> resigned, but his departure was "nothing that we desired or worked for." <PERSON>Mr. Koenig</PERSON> said: "I just got a tremendous offer from Gruntal." 
"The downsizing of the thrift industry is well under way," said <PERSON>Bert Ely</PERSON>, an industry consultant in <LOCATION>Alexandria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION> "This suggests the bailout law is having a more dramatic effect than anyone would have imagined so soon." 
<PERSON>James Barth</PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Thrift Supervision</ORGANIZATION>, also attributed some of the outflow to seasonal factors. "August is a month when people are paying school tuition," he said. "That and adjustment to the new law were the biggest factors in the industry." 
"The loss is in line with our expectations," said <PERSON>John C. Maxwell III</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Dillon, Read & Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
"It now looks like database IV Version 1.1 isn't going to be {widely} available until the first quarter of 1990," said <PERSON>David Bayer</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Montgomery Securities</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. "This is the second delay now in getting the product out the door.
<PERSON>Steven C. Walker</PERSON>, senior vice president of this bank holding company, was named president, chief executive officer and a director of both <ORGANIZATION>Commercial National and Commercial National Bank</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, with a measure of <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> complicity, has been manipulating the spending accounts for years under the cover of omnibus appropriations bills. (Indeed without earlier manipulations, the current sequester of $16 billion would have been even larger.) We suspect voters are fed up with the finagling.
However, the <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>'s account of the Monday sequester order signed by President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> neatly captured the contempt <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> shows toward the notion of a legally binding commitment: "Lawmakers have been saying for weeks that they plan to roll back the cuts as soon as they agree to a compromise on a deficit-cutting bill." 
<PERSON>Mr. Darman</PERSON>'s inclination to save the sequester was backed up yesterday by White House Press Secretary <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON>: "There is some feeling here that the cuts are the way to go.
<PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> would be acting in the public interest if he let the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> elites who manipulate these budgets -- the bureaucrats, the lobbyists, the congressional staffers -- live for just one year on a restricted diet.
<PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>'s continued support of the tax dam sustains this strategy of pressuring <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to make choices among competing priorities, rather than just saying yes to all the grateful special-interest constituencies that fill the <ORGANIZATION>PAC</ORGANIZATION> trough.

"We're trading with a very wary eye on Wall Street," said <PERSON>Trevor Woodland</PERSON>, chief corporate trader at <ORGANIZATION>Harris Trust & Savings Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. "No one is willing to place a firm bet that the stock market won't take another tumultuous ride." 
<ORGANIZATION>Harris Trust</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Woodland</PERSON> noted that the unit continues to show resilience in the face of a barrage of "headline negatives" in recent weeks, including rate increases in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, aggressive central bank intervention, a 190-point plunge in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> stock prices, an unexpectedly poor <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade report and action by the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> to nudge <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> rates lower. 
While <PERSON>Mr. Woodland</PERSON> doesn't predict a significant climb for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unit in light of recent moves in interest rates around the world, he noted that "its downside potential is surprisingly and -- for dollar bulls -- "impressively" limited. 
In <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Thursday, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> currency opened for trading at 140.97 yen, down from Wednesday's <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> close of 142.10 yen. 
Some dealers noted that nervousness over the recent sharp dive in stock prices could intensify following suggestions by <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Japan</ORGANIZATION> Governor <PERSON>Satoshi Sumita</PERSON> that appeared to advise Japanese investors to be very careful in investing in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> leveraged buy-outs. 
On the <ORGANIZATION>Commodity Exchange</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, gold for current delivery rose $1.30 to $368.70 an ounce in moderate trading.
<ORGANIZATION>GTE Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>MCI Communications Corp.</ORGANIZATION> reported strong earnings gains to record levels for the third quarter.
<ORGANIZATION>Southwestern Bell Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Cincinnati Bell</ORGANIZATION> posted slight declines. 
Earlier rate reductions in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> reduced the quarter's revenue and operating profit $55 million; a year earlier, operating profit in telephone operations was reduced by a similar amount as a result of a provision for a reorganization. 
Electrical products' sales fell to $496.7 million from $504.5 million with higher world-wide lighting volume offset by lower domestic prices and the impact of weaker currencies in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>.
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>GTE</ORGANIZATION> rose $1.25 to $64.125.
<PERSON>Daniel Akerson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>MCI</ORGANIZATION> chief financial officer, said the company sees further improvements in operating margins. "We think we can take it to the 18% range over next 18 to 24 months," he said. 
<PERSON>Charles Schellke</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, said some investors apparently expected slightly better revenue growth. 
The company said that residential traffic grew faster than business traffic and attributed that to its new PrimeTime calling plan that competes with <ORGANIZATION>American Telephone & Telegraph</ORGANIZATION>'s Reach Out <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> plan.
<PERSON>Mr. Akerson</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>MCI</ORGANIZATION> recorded "another solid cash positive quarter," its fourth in a row, but declined to comment on whether the company is considering a dividend or is planning any acquisition.
<ORGANIZATION>Southwestern Bell Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said net dropped 8.7%, mainly the result of four extraordinary items: a franchise tax refund that its <ORGANIZATION>Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.</ORGANIZATION> unit received last year; a production shift of several Yellow Pages directories to the fourth quarter from the third; a rate refund in <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> and a one-time adjustment to phone company revenues. 
Chairman <PERSON>Zane E. Barnes</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Southwestern Bell</ORGANIZATION>'s "businesses are healthy and are continuing to grow." 
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Cincinnati Bell</ORGANIZATION> fell 25 cents to $29. 
<ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION> said it will test market a caffeine-free version of its flagship brand, Coca-Cola Classic, beginning next week in <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION> Other, as yet unnamed, cities will follow.
After the confusion surrounding the change of the <ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION> formula in 1985, <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola</ORGANIZATION> was reluctant to clutter the Classic name with a brand extension.
"The name <ORGANIZATION>Classic Coke</ORGANIZATION> has tremendous value, and they haven't merchandised that name before," says <PERSON>Jesse Meyers</PERSON>, publisher of the trade journal <ORGANIZATION>Beverage Digest</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION> now leads <PERSON>Pepsi</PERSON> in market share in caffeine-free diet colas but trails <PERSON>Pepsi</PERSON> in sales of caffeine-free sugared colas, according to <ORGANIZATION>Beverage Digest</ORGANIZATION>. 
Hopes for quick enactment of pending deficit-reduction legislation faded as efforts to streamline the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> version in advance of a <ORGANIZATION>House-Senate</ORGANIZATION> conference broke down. 
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> leaders had hoped to follow the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>'s lead by getting an agreement from <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> committee chairmen under which they would drop items that wouldn't reduce the fiscal 1990 budget deficit from the House-passed bill before the negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> began. 
But the effort became snagged on the question of what would become of other issues, ranging from cutting the capital-gains tax to child care to repeal of catastrophic-illness insurance. "Many members feel there are important features of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> bill that should be enacted," Speaker <PERSON>Thomas Foley</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>) said. "If there is any support for reducing the bill, it is conditioned on their desire to see them passed in another form." 
Now those items will be discussed in a <ORGANIZATION>House-Senate</ORGANIZATION> conference, which could begin as soon as today, with the expectation that they could either be resolved there or placed into other legislation. "You've got to give these chairmen the opportunity to see if they can work things out," said <ORGANIZATION>House Budget Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Leon Panetta</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>). "This is a democratic process -- you can't slam-dunk anything around here." 
White House Budget Director <PERSON>Richard Darman</PERSON> has said he would continue to press to keep the capital-gains provision in the final version of the bill unless the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> drops many of its costly provisions. 
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> leaders had hoped to be able to send a compromise version of the measure to President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> by the end of the week, but <PERSON>Speaker Foley</PERSON> said that wasn't likely. 
Economist <PERSON>David N. Laband</PERSON>'s Sept. 27 editorial-page article, "In <LOCATION>Hugo</LOCATION>'s Path, a Man-Made Disaster," decries the control of price gouging, swiftly ordered by <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>'s governor after Hurricane Hugo.
<PERSON>Mr. Laband</PERSON> described one of the more insidious threats we face when dealing with disasters such as Hugo -- anti-profiteering ordinances such as that by the <ORGANIZATION>Charleston City Council</ORGANIZATION> as it thrashed about trying to Do Something. 
Would <PERSON>Mr. Laband</PERSON> also suggest that the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Salvation Army</ORGANIZATION>, military units, police, fire departments, rescue units and individual citizens cease their efforts to assist Hugo's victims because they interfere with his concept of the "free market"? 
<PERSON>Mr. Laband</PERSON> should beware, since he lives in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>.
In <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> after Hurricane <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON>, major grocery chains used their truck fleets to ship essential goods to <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, no gouging, just good will. 
<ORGANIZATION>Apogee Robotics Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said its board extended until Feb. 1 the exercise period of <ORGANIZATION>Apogee</ORGANIZATION>'s existing stock purchase warrants outstanding.
At <ORGANIZATION>Bear Stearns Cos.</ORGANIZATION>, for example, the 15 executive officers led by Chairman <PERSON>Alan</PERSON> "Ace" <PERSON>Greenberg</PERSON> got a pay increase to $35.9 million for the 14-month period ended June 30 from $22.9 million for the 12 months ended April 30, 1988.
<PERSON>William J. Montgoris</PERSON>, chief financial officer, defended the lofty salaries at <ORGANIZATION>Bear Stearns</ORGANIZATION>. "All of us are on a base salary of $200,000 if the firm makes nothing -- and that's pretty low as far as Wall Street goes," <PERSON>Mr. Montgoris</PERSON> said.
Four <ORGANIZATION>Bear Stearns</ORGANIZATION> executives besides the 62-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Greenberg</PERSON> were paid $3 million or more before dividends for the 14 months ended in June. 
According to the proxy statement, <PERSON>James E. Cayne</PERSON>, 55, <ORGANIZATION>Bear Stearns</ORGANIZATION>'s president, made $3.9 million; an executive vice president, <PERSON>Michael L. Tarnopol</PERSON>, 53, made nearly $3.4 million; and two executive vice presidents, <PERSON>Vincent J. Mattone</PERSON>, 44, and <PERSON>William J. Michaelcheck</PERSON>, 42, made about $3.3 million each. 
The refinancing is part of the <ORGANIZATION>TVA</ORGANIZATION>'s strategy of dealing with what has been an intractable problem: its staggering $18.5 billion debt, most of which is owed to the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury Department</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Federal Financing Bank</ORGANIZATION>.
The $4 billion bond issue also will help the <ORGANIZATION>TVA</ORGANIZATION> meet its goal of not raising rates for another year, said <PERSON>William F. Malec</PERSON>, the agency's chief financial officer. 
The bond issue is <ORGANIZATION>TVA</ORGANIZATION>'s first public offering since the <ORGANIZATION>Financing Bank</ORGANIZATION> was created in 1974, primarily to finance the <ORGANIZATION>TVA</ORGANIZATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>TVA</ORGANIZATION>, in fact, decided to proceed with the bond offering following an agreement last week with the <ORGANIZATION>Financing Bank</ORGANIZATION>, which allows <ORGANIZATION>TVA</ORGANIZATION> to keep borrowing short term from the bank for two years after it goes to the public market.
The <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> contended that <ORGANIZATION>TVA</ORGANIZATION> couldn't borrow from both it and the public debt market. 
Managing the bond issue is a group of investment banks headed by <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and co-managed by <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
Par also said it was advised by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney for <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> that it is one of a number of companies being investigated by a federal grand jury for alleged violations of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
A Par spokesman said he understood the criminal investigation in <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> relates to matters Par disclosed in July, when <ORGANIZATION>Par</ORGANIZATION> said it filed false drug information with the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION>.
Also yesterday, <PERSON>Ashok Patel</PERSON>, a former Par official who pleaded guilty to providing an <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> employee an illegal gratuity of $3,000, was sentenced by a federal judge in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> to one year of community service and a $150,000 fine.
<PERSON>Mr. Patel</PERSON> resigned as senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Par</ORGANIZATION> in April.
<PERSON>Perry Levine</PERSON>, chairman, said <PERSON>Mr. Sawyer</PERSON> had "taken significant steps" to restore the company's credibility and sense of professionalism and integrity. 
<ORGANIZATION>Hawker Siddeley Group PLC</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> engineering company, reported a 16% jump in pretax profit for the six-month period ending June 30. 
<LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Harold C. Simmons</PERSON> said he raised his stake in <ORGANIZATION>Lockheed Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to 10.62% from 10.43% of the aerospace and electronics concern's common shares. 
In a <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> filing, <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON> said he and companies he controls, <ORGANIZATION>NL Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NL Chemicals Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, hold 6,744,600 shares of <LOCATION>Lockheed</LOCATION>, of <LOCATION>Calabasas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Lockheed</ORGANIZATION> closed at $46.125 a share, down 12.5 cents. 
Earlier this week, <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON> objected to published reports quoting him as saying he planned to sell his <ORGANIZATION>Lockheed</ORGANIZATION> stake because "the defense industry seems to be getting more uncertain." 
<ORGANIZATION>Valhi Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, another of <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON>' companies, responded to an article Monday in The Wall Street Journal, which credited a story in the Sunday <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Daily News</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Valhi</ORGANIZATION> said the articles didn't accurately reflect <ORGANIZATION>Valhi</ORGANIZATION> and its affiliates' intentions toward <LOCATION>Lockheed</LOCATION>.
The decline primarily reflected the dilution from acquiring McCall's, Golf World (<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>) and Sailing World magazines; lower equity earnings from the forest-products group because of price discounting and an unfavorable exchange rate, and an 8.7% decline in advertising linage at the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION>, the company's flagship newspaper.
<PERSON>Ethan Bronner</PERSON>'s "Battle for Justice: How the <LOCATION>Bork</LOCATION> Nomination Shook America" (<ORGANIZATION>Norton</ORGANIZATION>, 399 pages, $22.50) is a spirited narrative of the nastiest of these hearings, done with journalistic verve, but with a flawed legal philosophy.
<ORGANIZATION>Given Democratic</ORGANIZATION> frustration with the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> victories and <ORGANIZATION>Court</ORGANIZATION> appointments, the contingency plans in place, and <PERSON>Mr. Bork</PERSON>'s paper trail of vulnerable writings, it was pretty clear that <PERSON>Judge Bork</PERSON> never stood much chance of being confirmed.
<ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Laurence Tribe</PERSON> was the constitutional heavy, laying out legal strategies for the senators and witnesses to follow.
But it was <PERSON>Ted Kennedy</PERSON> who scored most effectively with his searing portrayal of "<PERSON>Robert Bork</PERSON>'s America" -- the parade of imaginary horribles that would follow logically, he claimed, from the positions <PERSON>Mr. Bork</PERSON> had taken over the space of two decades.
Republican <PERSON>Sen. Arlen Specter</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> engaged the nominee in a verbal contest aimed at showing that <PERSON>Mr. Bork</PERSON> was willing to stretch the Constitution in one area (free speech) while remaining rigid in all the others.
It achieved a good media play, and enabled <PERSON>Sen. Specter</PERSON> and others to vote against <PERSON>Mr. Bork</PERSON> out of "conscience." Further ammunition came from left legal theorist <PERSON>Ronald Dworkin</PERSON>, who in the <LOCATION>New York Review</LOCATION> of Books painted a picture of a constitutional zombie willfully reading his personal prejudices into the Constitution, particularly in the area of "original intent." The charge of being "outside the mainstream" of legal thought gravely undercut <PERSON>Mr. Bork</PERSON>'s scholarly standing, leaving him bleeding on the platform. 
The nomination still might have been salvaged if a number of <ORGANIZATION>Democratic</ORGANIZATION> moderates in the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION> had broken party lines.
But Democratic <PERSON>Sen. Bennett Johnson</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> reminded the little band that anti-Bork blacks and women could furnish the margin to punish them in their next <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> elections.
Yet with the smooth confirmation of <PERSON>Anthony Kennedy</PERSON>, an "80 percenter" only slightly less supportive of judicial restraint than <PERSON>Mr. Bork</PERSON>, the Democrats may have won the battle but lost the war. 
Another upshot, however, was the chilling message the <LOCATION>Bork</LOCATION> hearings sent into the judicial culture from which the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> draws its talent.
He would discover it also in <PERSON>Alexander Bickel</PERSON>, a subtle constitutional scholar, <PERSON>Mr. Bork</PERSON>'s closest friend at <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>, whose influence on the judge goes well beyond <PERSON>Mr. Bronner</PERSON>'s reporting. 
One can understand <PERSON>Mr. Bork</PERSON>'s fear that the new right to privacy will become intolerably stretched, though a <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> composed of men and women with realism, guts and a sense of limits should be able to manage it.

In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, stocks closed lower in volatile trading as an opening rally was obliterated by worse-than-expected <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade figures.
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> shares had a similar reaction, but most other European bourses posted gains, as did all major <LOCATION>Asian</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> stock markets. 
In early trading Wednesday in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Nikkei</ORGANIZATION> index rose 19.30 points to 35015.38. 
"We're back to square one," said <PERSON>Simon Smithson</PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION>Kleinwort Benson International Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> rally seemed to confirm the view, frequently expressed in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> in the past few days, that the drop in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> was a local problem related to merger and acquisition activity in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
"This time we don't really have to worry about <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>," said an official at <ORGANIZATION>Daiwa Securities Co.</ORGANIZATION> "Nothing has changed fundamentally in the <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> market." 
There's no huge buying," said <PERSON>Stephen Hill</PERSON>, head of equity sales at <ORGANIZATION>Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>. "Really brave views right now would be foolhardy." 
Among steel shares, <ORGANIZATION>NKK</ORGANIZATION> rose 19 to 705 yen ($4.97) a share, and <ORGANIZATION>Nippon Steel</ORGANIZATION> gained 17 to 735.

<PERSON>Michael Hicks</PERSON>, who manages sales and trading for brokerage concern <PERSON>Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull</PERSON>, said: "It's a nervous market.
If you bought, you wish you hadn't, and if you sold, you wish you hadn't." He said the current market "is all about sentiment, and the sentiment in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> is 90% anxiety and worry." <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s economic fundamentals, he said, "don't look very bright."

He also said tragic results could follow any "hint of weakening" of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> defense commitment to <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> reported that 13.1% of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> population, or 31.9 million people, were living in poverty in 1988.
The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration accused <LOCATION>Israeli</LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON>Shamir</PERSON> of hindering peace efforts in the <LOCATION>Mideast</LOCATION> with "unhelpful" and disappointing statements.
<PERSON>Shamir</PERSON> said Tuesday that he was prepared to risk a policy conflict with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> over an <LOCATION>Egyptian</LOCATION> plan to hold direct Israeli-Palestinian talks, which the premier's <ORGANIZATION>Likud</ORGANIZATION> bloc opposes.

The <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> patients are the first humans to be given the drug, which is made by <ORGANIZATION>Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
"We're shocked by it, because it's worked so fast," said <PERSON>Dr. Thomas E. Starzl</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pittsburgh Transplantation Program</ORGANIZATION>, at a news conference here yesterday. "We consider it a life-saving drug, like one for AIDS," said <PERSON>Dr. John Fung</PERSON>, an immunologist at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pittsburgh</ORGANIZATION>. 
Researchers say they believe FK-506 is 100 times more effective than the traditional anti-rejection drug, cyclosporine, made by <LOCATION>Swiss</LOCATION> pharmaceutical giant <ORGANIZATION>Sandoz Ltd</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Dr. Fung</PERSON> said that FK-506 would not be available in the market for at least a year, and that the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> approval process usually takes three years to five years.
<PERSON>Dr. Starzl</PERSON> said the research has been largely financed by the <ORGANIZATION>National Institute of Health</ORGANIZATION> and by university funds, and that <PERSON>Fujisawa</PERSON> didn't give the hospital any grants.
<PERSON>Steve Jobs</PERSON> took a step back from the frontier of personal-computer technology in an effort to spur sales of <ORGANIZATION>Next Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's new machine. 
<PERSON>Mr. Jobs</PERSON>, co-founder of <ORGANIZATION>Apple Computer Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, founded Next four years ago in the hopes of fomenting a revolution in the way desktop computers are designed and used.
Commercial customers can purchase the same system through <ORGANIZATION>Businessland Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a computer retailer based in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, for roughly $3,000 more. 
"From the standpoint of being on the forefront of technology, this is a step backward," said <PERSON>Jerry W. Sprecher</PERSON>, a senior computing manager for the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> state university system. "But it will definitely boost Next's sales." 
Universities, however, say Next's prices must go even lower before large numbers of students purchase the machine. "We'd still like to see a student model," priced at about $3,500, said <PERSON>Ronald Johnson</PERSON>, director of academic computing at <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Gustavus Adolphus College</ORGANIZATION>, which has bought eight Next machines. 
<ORGANIZATION>Mesa Airlines</ORGANIZATION> said the takeover offer it received earlier this week from <ORGANIZATION>StatesWest Airlines</ORGANIZATION> is for a combination of cash and securities valued by <ORGANIZATION>StatesWest</ORGANIZATION> at $10 a <ORGANIZATION>Mesa</ORGANIZATION> share.
When it made the offer, <ORGANIZATION>StatesWest</ORGANIZATION> declined to disclose details and asked <PERSON>Mesa</PERSON> to do the same.
But <PERSON>Farmington</PERSON>, N.M.-based <PERSON>Mesa</PERSON> said the offer was for $7 in cash and unspecified StatesWest securities valued at $3 a share.
Based on the number of <ORGANIZATION>Mesa</ORGANIZATION> shares outstanding not already owned by <ORGANIZATION>StatesWest</ORGANIZATION>, the proposed takeover would have a value of about $15.3 million.
<ORGANIZATION>StatesWest</ORGANIZATION> owns 7.25% of <ORGANIZATION>Mesa</ORGANIZATION>. 
Last week, <ORGANIZATION>Mesa</ORGANIZATION> rejected a general proposal from <ORGANIZATION>StatesWest</ORGANIZATION> that the two carriers combine.
In response to the specific offer, <PERSON>Gary Risley</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Mesa</ORGANIZATION> vice president, said management will ask directors to employ a financial consultant to advise them. 
<ORGANIZATION>AVX Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Unitrode Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said they completed the previously reported sale of <ORGANIZATION>Unitrode</ORGANIZATION>'s San Diego-based Passive Components division to <ORGANIZATION>AVX</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>AVX</ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based maker of passive electronic products, paid $11 million in cash to <ORGANIZATION>Unitrode</ORGANIZATION>, a Lexington-based maker of semiconductor products.
The announcement coincides with the start of the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Ministers Conference</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Kuala Lumpur</LOCATION>, where proposals for renewed sanctions against <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, including moves to block settling of a new debt agreement, were scheduled to be discussed. 
<ORGANIZATION>Arkla</ORGANIZATION> said its initial offering of 18% of <ORGANIZATION>Arkla Exploration Co.</ORGANIZATION> is expected to result in a net gain of about $90 million, which will be used to pay down <ORGANIZATION>Arkla</ORGANIZATION> debt.
<ORGANIZATION>Arkla Exploration</ORGANIZATION> owns sizable gas and crude-oil reserves in the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION>. 
Dow blamed the third-quarter earnings drop on several factors, including softer prices for polyethylene and other basic chemicals, a slower <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economy and a stronger dollar, which made Dow's exports from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> more expensive to overseas customers.
I approached "Mastergate," <PERSON>Larry Gelbart</PERSON>'s new comedy at the <ORGANIZATION>Criterion Center</ORGANIZATION>, with considerable trepidation.
I had underestimated, however, both <PERSON>Mr. Gelbart</PERSON>'s wit and the persistence of scandal in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
In fact, at one point Merry Chase (<ORGANIZATION>Melinda Mullins</ORGANIZATION>), a cool, carefully coiffed television announcer, recites a list of a dozen or more scandals of recent years, concluding with those affecting the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Housing and Urban Development</ORGANIZATION> and the savings and loan industry. 
The witness table is center stage and below it, the paraphernalia for the ever-present media, in this case <ORGANIZATION>TNN</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Total News Network</ORGANIZATION>.
The man, it seems, has a <LOCATION>Lichtenstein</LOCATION> corporation, licensed in <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> and sheltered in the <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION>.
He himself lives in a "consecutive series of unnumbered houses in a town in <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>." The property seized by the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> is a <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> film studio, Master Pictures Incorporated (MPI).
Supposedly the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> will sell off the assets of <ORGANIZATION>MPI</ORGANIZATION>, but before it can, a lowly <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> agent is called into the hospital room of <PERSON>Wylie Slaughter</PERSON>, the dying head of the <ORGANIZATION>Central Intelligence Agency</ORGANIZATION>. 
Soon the studio is producing a $40 million picture called "Tet, the <ORGANIZATION>Motion Picture</ORGANIZATION>," to distinguish it from "Tet, the Offensive," as well as "Tet, the Book" and "Tet, the Album." The picture, to be made in the Central American country of <LOCATION>San Elvador</LOCATION>, is a cover for sending $800 million of arms to <LOCATION>Los Otros</LOCATION>, the rebel group attempting to regain neighboring <LOCATION>Ambigua</LOCATION>, which has been taken over by the leftist dictator <PERSON>Dr. Overtega</PERSON>, a former podiatrist, who leads a revolutionary band of foot soldiers.
The man handling all this for the now-deceased Slaughter is <ORGANIZATION>Major Manley Battle</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Gelbart</PERSON>'s stand in for Col. <PERSON>Oliver North</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Daniel von Bargen</PERSON> is ramrod-stiff but totally assured as <ORGANIZATION>Major Battle</ORGANIZATION>, mixing just the right brand of self-righteousness and patriotism; <PERSON>Jeff Weiss</PERSON> is fire, brimstone and teary-eyed emotionalism as the far-right senator who serves as a friendly interrogator of <ORGANIZATION>Major Battle</ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON>Zach Grenier</PERSON> is maddeningly officious playing a succession of lawyers; <PERSON>Joseph Daly</PERSON> has the perfect "aw, shucks" demeanor of <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> in his portrayal of the vice president; and <PERSON>Ann McDonough</PERSON> is first-rate as a succession of witnesses' wives.
<PERSON>Mr. Gelbart</PERSON> also has fun with language. "Mastergate" is subtitled "a play on words," and <PERSON>Mr. Gelbart</PERSON> plays that game as well as anyone.
As the hearings begin, the self-important <PERSON>Sen. Bowman</PERSON> (<PERSON>Jerome Kilty</PERSON>) announces: "Let me emphaticize one thing at the outset: We are not looking for hides to skin nor goats to scape." <ORGANIZATION>Major Battle</ORGANIZATION> himself speaks in pure Pentagonese: "Without further monetary-stroke-military aid, scores of <LOCATION>Ambiguan</LOCATION> freedom lovers, who had gone way out on their life and limbs for us, were literally cut off at the knees without a paddle." At another point he intones: "Publicity is a small price to pay for secrecy." 
<ORGANIZATION>Lionel Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's board unanimously rejected a tender offer of $8 a share, or $95.4 million, for as much as 90% of <ORGANIZATION>Lionel</ORGANIZATION> by a group with a 9.9% stake in the toy retailer. 
<ORGANIZATION>Lionel</ORGANIZATION> also said the offer by <ORGANIZATION>Robert I. Toussie Limited Partnership</ORGANIZATION> is inadequate, and full of conditions that leave it "subject to substantial uncertainty." 
In addition, <ORGANIZATION>Lionel</ORGANIZATION> began a lawsuit in federal <ORGANIZATION>District Court</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> seeking to enjoin the offer, alleging, among other things, violations of federal securities law and fraudulent manipulation of the market for <ORGANIZATION>Lionel</ORGANIZATION>'s securities. 
<PERSON>Robert I. Toussie</PERSON>, general partner of the investment group, said the <ORGANIZATION>Lionel</ORGANIZATION> response reflected management's entrenched position, saying officials had failed to come up with a better alternative to his group's offer.
<PERSON>Mr. Toussie</PERSON> said he would respond to <PERSON>Lionel</PERSON>'s suit after his lawyers review it. 
Though the Cubs' championship season ended with the <ORGANIZATION>National League</ORGANIZATION> playoffs, a revival of the Organic Theater's production of "<PERSON>Bleacher Bums</PERSON>," a play in nine innings set in the <LOCATION>Wrigley Field</LOCATION> bleachers, continues within spitting distance of the ballpark. 
He is the jealous friend of <LOCATION>Philinte</LOCATION>, and the jealous lover of <PERSON>Celimene</PERSON>.
Assuming modern audiences readily understand that <LOCATION>Moliere</LOCATION>'s social indictment covers their world as well as 17th-century <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Wilbur</PERSON> concentrated his formidable artistry on rendering the <LOCATION>Alexandrine French</LOCATION> verse into sprightly and theatrical English iambic pentameter.
If <PERSON>Mr. Wilbur</PERSON>'s translation is a finely ground lens through which we see the pettiness and corruption of 17th-century <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Falls</PERSON>'s production is a mirror in which we see ourselves. 
<PERSON>Mr. Falls</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Goodman</ORGANIZATION>'s artistic director, took a recent adaptation by <PERSON>Neil Bartlett</PERSON> and significantly adapted it.
<PERSON>Mr. Bartlett</PERSON> had slimmed <ORGANIZATION>Moliere</ORGANIZATION>'s cast of characters to six and set them in the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> media world of <LOCATION>Thatcherite Britain</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Falls</PERSON> transfers the setting to <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>, and transforms the characters into what passes for aristocracy there -- agents, producers, actors, writers and sycophants. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bartlett</PERSON> managed to more or less maintain <ORGANIZATION>Moliere</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Alexandrine</PERSON> verse form, 12 syllable lines in rhyming couplets.
<PERSON>Mr. Falls</PERSON> kept the form, but Americanized it with <PERSON>Mr. Bartlett</PERSON>'s further help.
With a splendid cast led by <PERSON>David Darlow</PERSON> as <PERSON>Alceste</PERSON>, <PERSON>Christina Haag</PERSON> as <PERSON>Celimene</PERSON> and, especially, <PERSON>William Brown</PERSON> as a <PERSON>Philinte</PERSON> who plays the <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION> game but harbors authentic values and feelings, the Goodman production barrels through an all-night <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> party with exuberance and wit.
If this version, with its references to <PERSON>Steven Spielberg</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Spago</LOCATION> and "thirtysomething" attracts younger audiences who might stay away from the classical version, then Messrs.
<PERSON>Bartlett</PERSON> and Falls are justified in abandoning <PERSON>Mr. Wilbur</PERSON>. 
The Steppenwolf Theatre Company, back from a critical and box office success in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> with its adaptation of <PERSON>Steinbeck</PERSON>'s "The Grapes of Wrath," opened the new season with <PERSON>Harold Pinter</PERSON>'s "The Homecoming," first produced by the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Shakespeare Company</ORGANIZATION> in 1965. 
But under <PERSON>Jerry Perry</PERSON>'s direction the current <PERSON>Steppenwolf</PERSON> production, scheduled to play through Nov. 19, breaks through the flat and boring ritual that "The Homecoming" had become.
Led by a near-perfect performance by <PERSON>Alan Wilder</PERSON> as <PERSON>Max</PERSON>, the father, the play is at once an appalling and hilarious dissection of a family's rage, bitterness, fear and isolation.
Three of the family members, <PERSON>Max</PERSON> and his two sons, <PERSON>Lenny</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joey</PERSON>, live off the flesh: <PERSON>Max</PERSON> is a retired butcher, <PERSON>Lenny</PERSON> a pimp and <PERSON>Joey</PERSON> an aspiring boxer.
<PERSON>Sam</PERSON>, <PERSON>Max</PERSON>'s brother, has escaped the flesh by working as a liveried chauffeur and never seeking a wife.
Teddy, the eldest of <PERSON>Max</PERSON>'s sons, has made the most dramatic escape by becoming a professor of philosophy at an <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> university. 
The play concerns <PERSON>Teddy</PERSON>'s homecoming with his wife of six years, <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>.
Curiously, <PERSON>Randall Arney</PERSON> as Teddy seems the only cast member unable to get beyond the zombie approach to a <LOCATION>Pinter</LOCATION> character.
As <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>, <PERSON>Moira Harris</PERSON>, a large and beautiful woman who may be our next <PERSON>Colleen Dewhurst</PERSON>, begins almost immediately to overpower each of the men.
In the end, Teddy returns alone to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, leaving <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Max</LOCATION>'s chair.
While <PERSON>Steppenwolf</PERSON> was in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> with "The Grapes of Wrath," <PERSON>Bruce Sagan</PERSON>, the president of its board of directors, quietly returned to <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> to buy a piece of real estate in the city's rapidly reviving <LOCATION>North Halsted Street</LOCATION> restaurant and theater district.
The troupe currently performs in a converted dairy that seats 211 and provides little capacity for staging anything beyond a simple one-set production. "If we wanted to stage `Death of a Salesman, ' " <PERSON>Mr. Sagan</PERSON> says, "<PERSON>Willie Loman</PERSON> would have to live in a ranch house because of the low ceiling." 
<PERSON>Mr. Sagan</PERSON>, a former publisher and real estate developer, has put together an $8 million financial package that includes approximately $4 million of tax exempt bonds issued by the State of <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> (the first time that a state has used its educational facilities authority to support construction of a theater), and approximately $1 million in grants from the <ORGANIZATION>National Endowment for the Arts</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>MacArthur Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, and a few other deep pockets.
<PERSON>Mr. Sagan</PERSON> compares the importance of <LOCATION>Steppenwolf</LOCATION> with <PERSON>Orson Welles</PERSON>'s Mercury Theater in the '30s.
What will <PERSON>Mr. Sagan</PERSON> do with his new theater building if the allure of <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Broadway</LOCATION> proves too much for such <PERSON>Steppenwolf</PERSON> stalwarts as <PERSON>John Malkovich</PERSON> ("Dangerous Liaisons"), <PERSON>Joan Allen</PERSON> ("The Heidi Chronicles"), and <PERSON>Glenne Headly</PERSON> ("Lonesome Dove"), and the company crumbles? "That's OK," <PERSON>Mr. Sagan</PERSON> replies. "Let this building be <PERSON>Steppenwolf</PERSON>'s legacy to <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> theater." 
<PERSON>Dale Lang</PERSON>, who this week completed the acquisition of the publisher of <PERSON>Ms.</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sassy</PERSON>, is candid about the challenge he is taking on. 
<PERSON>Mr. Lang</PERSON> admits that <PERSON>Ms.</PERSON> is "in dire straits" and that Sassy needs big promotional dollars to keep it alive.
I want to publish one that succeeds," said <PERSON>Mr. Lang</PERSON>. "For <PERSON>Ms.</PERSON>, it's time to publish for the reader, not the advertiser." 
As for Sassy, which competes directly with <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's Seventeen magazine, <PERSON>Mr. Lang</PERSON> says that in the next two years he will spend $6 million promoting and improving the magazine. 
<PERSON>Mr. Lang</PERSON> said the former Australian owners of Sassy were "blind-sided by the Moral Majority. . . . Their reaction was to do nothing and ride it out." He said <ORGANIZATION>Sassy</ORGANIZATION> will keep its irreverent tone, but added, "We will keep a close watch on the editorial content of the magazine." 
What's more, <PERSON>Mr. Lang</PERSON> says he has what all publishers wish for: a bona fide niche. "Seventeen is written more for mothers, not their daughters," said <PERSON>Mr. Lang</PERSON>. "But Sassy has a different spirit.
I feel about Sassy like I did about Working Woman 10 years ago." <PERSON>Mr. Lang</PERSON> took on <ORGANIZATION>Ms.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sassy</ORGANIZATION> with the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Matilda Publications Inc.</ORGANIZATION> by his newly formed <ORGANIZATION>Lang Communications</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Lang</PERSON> owns 70% of <LOCATION>Matilda</LOCATION>, while <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> owns the rest through its <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp Venture Capital Partners</ORGANIZATION>.
Two weeks ago, <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Mr. Lang</PERSON> pumped $800,000 into <LOCATION>Matilda</LOCATION> just to keep the doors open. 
Industry observers have congratulated <PERSON>Mr. Lang</PERSON> on what some call his "courageous" handling of <PERSON>Ms.</PERSON>, but his track record in magazine publishing in general has gotten mixed reviews. 
Besides Ms. and <ORGANIZATION>Sassy</ORGANIZATION>, closely held <ORGANIZATION>Lang Communications</ORGANIZATION> includes Success, a magazine for entrepreneurs and small businesses, and Working Woman and Working Mother, two monthly magazines.
Working Woman and <ORGANIZATION>Working Mother</ORGANIZATION> have operated as part of Working Woman/McCall's Group, a less-than-successful joint venture between <PERSON>Mr. Lang</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
The joint venture is being undone, with <PERSON>McCall</PERSON>'s magazine being sold last summer to the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Magazine Group</ORGANIZATION> for about $80 million, and <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner</ORGANIZATION> agreeing to sell back its 50% interest in Working Woman and Working Mother to <PERSON>Mr. Lang</PERSON>. 
Executives at <ORGANIZATION>Time Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Magazine Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner</ORGANIZATION>, have said the joint venture with <PERSON>Mr. Lang</PERSON> wasn't a good one.
Time executives complained about the shoddy editorial quality, and in the end, one <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION> executive who asked not to be identified said, "Frankly, <PERSON>McCall</PERSON>'s and the joint venture were an embarrassment." 
<PERSON>Mr. Lang</PERSON> feels that <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION>'s priorities changed. "Their management changed right after {the venture was formed}, and I don't think they were comfortable getting into the competitive wars of women's service magazines." 
Today, <PERSON>Mr. Lang</PERSON> believes his magazines will offer what many women's magazines don't. "We write straight for women on their level," he said. "We don't have passive readers." <PERSON>Mr. Lang</PERSON> points out that even Success, in part, fits the company's image, since about 30% of its readership is female. 
<PERSON>Mr. Lang</PERSON> has named <PERSON>Carol Taber</PERSON>, 43, as group publisher of <ORGANIZATION>New York-based Lang Communications</ORGANIZATION>.
The sale price of <ORGANIZATION>McCall</ORGANIZATION>'s -- twice what <PERSON>Mr. Lang</PERSON> originally paid for it -- will finance <ORGANIZATION>Lang Communications</ORGANIZATION>' buy-back of <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner</ORGANIZATION>'s 50% interest in Working Woman and Working Mother.
Mutual-fund czar <PERSON>John M. Templeton</PERSON> has put his money where his moniker is, pouring $1.4 million into one of his own funds, the <ORGANIZATION>Templeton Value Fund</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Templeton</PERSON> owns shares in several of the 33 funds that his firm manages, but only in three of the 10 available to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> investors, according to filings with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>.
Those are <ORGANIZATION>Templeton Global Income</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Templeton Emerging Markets</ORGANIZATION> and now the Value Fund. 
Because he's very bullish on the emerging growth stocks that make up the fund's portfolio, <PERSON>Mr. Templeton</PERSON> said from his <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION> hideaway. 
<PERSON>Mr. Templeton</PERSON>'s 147,300-share purchase in the closed-end fund came before the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stock market's plunge last Friday, but still proved slightly profitable. 
<PERSON>Mr. Templeton</PERSON> bought his shares in several separate purchases between Aug. 30 and Sept. 28, according to reports with the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>.
RIVER RUN: A senior vice president and a vice president at <ORGANIZATION>James River Corp.</ORGANIZATION> sold the majority of their shares in the <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, paper-products concern in late August and early September, reports filed with the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> show. 
In <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>James River</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at $28.375, down 12.5 cents. 
On Sept. 6, <PERSON>Robert Joseph Sherry</PERSON>, the firm's senior vice president of employee and public relations, sold 4,000 shares, leaving himself with 1,062 shares of <PERSON>James River</PERSON>.
Including a sale of stock last February, <PERSON>Mr. Sherry</PERSON> has sold 88% of his stake in the company this year, according to <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> filings.
<PERSON>Mr. Taft</PERSON>, who is also president of <ORGANIZATION>Taft Broadcasting Co.</ORGANIZATION>, said he bought the shares because he keeps a utility account at the brokerage firm of <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which had recommended the stock as a good buy.
"<ORGANIZATION>Cincinnati Gas & Electric</ORGANIZATION> is in good shape," <PERSON>Mr. Taft</PERSON> said, and utilities are "a good investment because interest rates are going down." 
<PERSON>Peter Pae</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> contributed to this article. 
It's like "fire insurance," says <PERSON>Harrison Roth</PERSON>, the senior options strategist at <ORGANIZATION>Cowen & Co</ORGANIZATION>.
For instance, the most popular index option is the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 100 option, commonly called the <ORGANIZATION>OEX</ORGANIZATION>.
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <PERSON>Olin</PERSON> closed at $58.50 a share, down 25 cents. 
The proposed holding company would also consolidate <ORGANIZATION>Great American Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> and its <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, savings bank into a single, federally chartered institution in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>.
The former president of <ORGANIZATION>FirstSouth F.A.</ORGANIZATION>, a defunct <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> thrift, pleaded guilty to conspiring to inflate the institution's earnings by concealing worthless loan guarantees. 
<PERSON>Roderick D. Reed III</PERSON>, who was also chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION>FirstSouth</ORGANIZATION>, could receive a maximum sentence of five years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine.
<PERSON>Mr. Reed</PERSON> admitted he conspired to conceal an agreement not to enforce loan guarantees executed by <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> real-estate developers <PERSON>A. Starke Taylor III</PERSON> and <PERSON>George S. Watson</PERSON>, both of whom were <ORGANIZATION>FirstSouth</ORGANIZATION> stockholders.
Neither <PERSON>Mr. Taylor</PERSON> nor <PERSON>Mr. Watson</PERSON> have been charged with criminal wrongdoing. 
<PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> and <PERSON>Watson</PERSON> were entered on FirstSouth's books as loans, allowing the thrift to report fees and interest as current income, according to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION>Little Rock</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ark</LOCATION>. 
The conspiracy was part of an effort by <PERSON>Mr. Reed</PERSON> to hide <ORGANIZATION>FirstSouth</ORGANIZATION>'s shaky financial condition from federal regulators, according to federal prosecutors and regulators.
<PERSON>Watson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr. Weichern</PERSON> is scheduled for trial Jan. 3 before federal <PERSON>Judge Stephen Reasoner</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Little Rock</LOCATION>. 
The lethal shudders that wracked the <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay Area</LOCATION> -- rated a 6.9 on the <PERSON>Richter</PERSON> scale -- didn't match the great earthquake of 1906, rated at 8.25. 
The difference of just 1.35 points on the scale, designed by <PERSON>Charles Richter</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>CalTech</ORGANIZATION> in the 1930s, means the older quake was "10 to 20 times stronger," says <PERSON>Lane Johnson</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>University of California Berkeley Seismographic Station</ORGANIZATION>. 
The ground ruptured along a 20-to-30-mile stretch of the <ORGANIZATION>San Andreas Fault</ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, <PERSON>Mr. Johnson</PERSON> added.
Though the epicenter of Tuesday's temblor was located 10 miles north of the town of <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>, and 50 miles south of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, its havoc hopscotched up the coast in seemingly random fashion.
But the greatest damage was visited on buildings and roadways perched upon landfill, as were the <LOCATION>Marina District of San Francisco</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Bay Bridge</LOCATION> -- two areas of maximum devastation. 
"Landfill -- loose and unconsolidated earth -- may feel like rock but it behaves like liquid when you shake it," said <PERSON>Douglas Segar</PERSON>, professor of geosciences at <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco State University</ORGANIZATION> in a televised interview. "It liquefies in a patchwork quilt pattern.
<PERSON>Mr. Johnson</PERSON>, of the <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> seismographic station, said: "Landfill can be done if it's properly compacted.
"The big one is still due," <PERSON>Mr. Johnson</PERSON> predicted in an interview. "The <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> has three very dangerous faults, the <LOCATION>San Andreas</LOCATION>, the <PERSON>Hayward</PERSON> fault and the <LOCATION>Calaveras</LOCATION> fault.
His comments, made in response to reporters' questions at the <ORGANIZATION>National Press Club</ORGANIZATION> here, signaled that <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> is resisting <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> pressure for a further rise in the currency's value.
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> wants a higher won to make <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>'s exports more expensive and help trim <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>'s trade surplus.
<PERSON>Mr. Roh</PERSON> also said <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> is taking steps that would free the won to respond to market forces.
<PERSON>Mr. Roh</PERSON> said a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> demand for the removal of South Korean import quotas on beef will be resolved "satisfactorily" but gave no hint when that will happen.
Speaking to a joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> earlier, he said <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> can't move quickly on such agricultural trade issues "without causing political and social trauma." 
Some $170 million of the $233 million increase in nonperforming loans was related to real estate, and roughly three-quarters of that was in the troubled <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> market, according to <PERSON>Richard Driscoll</PERSON>, vice chairman. 
<PERSON>Mr. Driscoll</PERSON> said that, despite continued weakness in the region's real estate market, <ORGANIZATION>Bank of New England</ORGANIZATION> expects the rate of increase in nonperforming assets to slow in coming quarters.
Among other restructuring measures, the bank said it will close its loan production offices in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>.
The <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> office figured prominently in the bank's problems earlier this year, when $65 million in loans to <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> businessman <PERSON>William Stoecker</PERSON> went sour.

The issue is rated triple-A by <ORGANIZATION>Moody's</ORGANIZATION> and triple-A by <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION>. 
The provisions, in deficit-reduction bills recently passed by the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, could raise the price tags of such deals by up to 10% and cool the takeover boom. 
A bill giving the <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION> the power to block airline leveraged buy-outs cleared a <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> panel.
But Secretary <PERSON>Skinner</PERSON> said he would urge <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to veto the bill. 
<ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION> said it is seeking improved terms and a sharply lower price in any revised bid for <ORGANIZATION>United Air</ORGANIZATION>'s parent.

Efforts by a federal mediator to reignite talks between <ORGANIZATION>Boeing Co.</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Machinists</ORGANIZATION> union apparently failed, and no further meetings are scheduled. 
"The New Crowd" by <PERSON>Judith Ramsey Ehrlich</PERSON> and <PERSON>Barry J. Rehfeld</PERSON> (Little, <PERSON>Brown</PERSON>, 444 pages, $19.95), describes the displacing of the old "our crowd" Jewish Wall Street banking grandees by such new business barons as <PERSON>Saul Steinberg</PERSON>, <PERSON>Carl Icahn</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sanford Weill</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bruce Wasserstein</PERSON>.
These two New Crowd families lived in the same apartment building, with the <ORGANIZATION>Postel</ORGANIZATION> penthouse perched on top of the <LOCATION>Gutfreund</LOCATION> duplex.
But the <ORGANIZATION>Gutfreund</ORGANIZATION> workers went ahead anyway, only to be captured "in flagrante" by <PERSON>Joan Postel</PERSON>, who called the police. 
Before the Gutfreunds finally left this unfriendly environment for a prodigious duplex on Fifth Avenue and an 18th-century mansion with a specially excavated $1 million garage in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, the <PERSON>Postels</PERSON> had obtained an injunction to prevent any future hoisting of trees, and in a neighborly spirit hit both the <LOCATION>Gutfreunds</LOCATION> and the building with a $35 million lawsuit.
The young <PERSON>John Gutfreund</PERSON> had been discovered by <PERSON>Billy Salomon</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Bros.</ORGANIZATION> when he was still a bearded liberal, and put to work as a trader, and then as a rough-and-tumble syndicator. " `Get off your . . .,' he would bellow," say the authors.
After he had been head of the company for 3 1/2 years, he and his partners sold it to <LOCATION>Phibro</LOCATION>, a powerful commodity trading outfit, for $550 million in <LOCATION>Phibro</LOCATION> stock.
<PERSON>Mr. Gutfreund</PERSON> collected $32 million, while <PERSON>Billy Salomon</PERSON> got $10 million, much less than if he had conducted the sale. "I felt betrayed," he later said.
Its profits, unlike <PERSON>Phibro</PERSON>'s, soared over the next two years, and had it held out, <ORGANIZATION>Salomon</ORGANIZATION> could have gotten an even bigger bundle. 
Often the genteel, conservative, long-term-oriented investment bankers were displaced by crude traders: "When angered, he cursed so forcefully that his face reddened and his pale-blue eyes narrowed into tiny slits," the authors say of <ORGANIZATION>Lehman</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Lewis Glucksman</PERSON>. 
The earlier generation of "our crowd" bankers -- Belmonts, <ORGANIZATION>Warburgs</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Lehmans</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Baches</PERSON> and Schiffs -- had stressed above all probity, tradition, continuity and reputation.
As described in "The New Crowd," they take on ambitious new wives, move to <LOCATION>Greenwich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, or <LOCATION>Bedford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, buy OK pictures, and let their wives share the wealth with decorators.
A handful of the New Crowd operators have crossed the line from the immoral to the illegal, and have ended up in the slammer or paying huge fines: <PERSON>Ivan Boesky</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dennis Levine</PERSON>, <PERSON>Martin Siegel</PERSON>, <PERSON>Victor</PERSON> and <PERSON>Steven Posner</PERSON>, and now <PERSON>Michael Milken</PERSON> and perhaps <PERSON>Leona Helmsley</PERSON>.
The glitzy office that <PERSON>Ivan Boesky</PERSON> vacated for a prison cell had previously contained commodity operators <PERSON>Marc Rich</PERSON> and "Pinky" Green, today fugitives from a potential century apiece of jail sentences. 
<PERSON>Mr. Boesky</PERSON> was a piker compared to Jay Gould and <PERSON>Jim Fiske</PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION>Commodore Vanderbilt</ORGANIZATION> thought nothing of bribing judges and legislators.
<PERSON>Mr. Train</PERSON> is president of Train, <ORGANIZATION>Smith Investment Counsel</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Enserch Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said about 12 million, or 93%, of the publicly traded units of its limited partnership, <ORGANIZATION>Enserch Exploration Partners Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, were tendered in response to an offer that expired Monday. 
About 900,000 units will continue to be publicly traded on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Enserch</ORGANIZATION> said.
THE <ORGANIZATION>YOM KIPPUR WAR</ORGANIZATION>, WHEN EGYPT CRASHED into <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> on Oct. 6, 1973, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, lasted barely a month.
The <LOCATION>Arab states</LOCATION>, always bitterly resentful of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> support toward <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>, realized they held an irresistable weapon -- oil.
On Oct. 22, led by <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>, the world's largest exporter, they embargoed oil shipments to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and to the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>'s staunchest <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> ally. 
In 1956, when <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> to seize the Suez Canal, <PERSON>Arab</PERSON> producers cut off supplies to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
Imports, then six million barrels a day, came primarily from <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, far more dependent on <LOCATION>Mideast</LOCATION> oil than the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, wouldn't offend the Arabs or trade off their precious supplies.
Democrat <PERSON>Gene Taylor</PERSON> won a special election to fill the congressional seat vacated by the death of Republican <PERSON>Larkin Smith</PERSON>, taking back the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION>'s lone redoubt in <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> delegation. 
<PERSON>Mr. Taylor</PERSON>'s overwhelming victory against <ORGANIZATION>Republican</ORGANIZATION> <PERSON>Tom Anderson</PERSON> reclaims a seat the Republicans had held for 17 years and gives the Democrats their fifth victory in the seven special <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> elections held this year.
<PERSON>Mr. Taylor</PERSON>, a 36-year-old state senator from <LOCATION>Bay St. Louis</LOCATION>, won 65% of the vote in a district that has voted <ORGANIZATION>Republican</ORGANIZATION> in the past five presidential elections and that was once represented by Republican <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <PERSON>Sen. Trent Lott</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Anderson</PERSON>, a former <PERSON>Lott</PERSON> aide, received campaign assistance from the senator and from President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, who visited the district last week. 
The rally spread into <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> markets, where traders were still betting that the earthquake disrupted the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> area's large oil refining plants. 
At the opening of the <ORGANIZATION>New York Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>West Texas</LOCATION> Intermediate for November delivery shot up 10 cents a barrel, to $20.85, still on the belief that the refineries were damaged. 
In the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> area, roughly 800,000 barrels a day of crude, about a third of all the refining capacity in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, is processed daily, according to industry data.
But yesterday, as the morning wore on, some major <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> refinery operators -- including <ORGANIZATION>Chevron Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Exxon Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Shell Oil Co.</ORGANIZATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION>Royal Dutch/Shell Group</ORGANIZATION> -- said their refineries weren't damaged and were continuing to operate normally.
"The market was basically acting on two contradictory forces," said <PERSON>Nauman Barakat</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "One is the panic, the earthquake in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, which is positive." 
According to one analyst, workers at the <LOCATION>Cananea</LOCATION> copper mine in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, which hasn't been operating since it was declared bankrupt by the Mexican government in late August, are set to return to work.
He added that, while there hasn't been any official announcement as yet, the <LOCATION>Highland Valley</LOCATION> mine strike in <LOCATION>British Columbia</LOCATION>, which has lasted more than three months, is regarded as settled.
The first analyst said that the Japanese, as well as the Chinese, bought copper earlier in the week in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, but that this purchasing has since slackened as the supply situation, at least over the long term, appears to have improved. "The focus for some time has been on the copper supply, and good demand has been taken for granted," he said. "Now that the supply situation seems to be improving, it would be best for traders to switch their concentration to the demand side." He noted the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> report yesterday that housing starts in September dropped 5.2% from August to 1.26 million units on an annualized basis, the lowest level in seven years. "Along with these factors, other economic reports suggest a slowing of the economy, which could mean reduced copper usage," he said. 
According to one dealer, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> said it has only 40,000 tons of sugar remaining to be shipped to it this year by <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> under current commitments.
The announcement was made because of reports Tuesday that <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> would delay shipments to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> scheduled for later this year, into early next year.
LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: The <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> is expected to announce tomorrow that the number of cattle in the 13 major ranch states slipped 4% to 8.21 million on Oct. 1 compared with the level a year earlier, said <PERSON>Tom Morgan</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Sterling Research Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Arlington Heights</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill</LOCATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Federal National Mortgage Association</ORGANIZATION> set up a three-member office of the chairman and elected <PERSON>James A. Johnson</PERSON> as vice chairman, effective Jan. 1. 
<PERSON>Mr. Johnson</PERSON> has been a managing director at <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton</ORGANIZATION> since 1985, and before that was president of <ORGANIZATION>Public Strategies</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> consulting firm.
He is well-known in Democratic circles, having been executive assistant to Vice President <PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON> and chairman of <PERSON>Mr. Mondale</PERSON>'s 1984 presidential campaign. 
At <ORGANIZATION>Fannie Mae</ORGANIZATION>, he will take responsibility for the corporation's financial and legal areas and will work with <PERSON>David Maxwell</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, and <PERSON>Roger Birk</PERSON>, president and chief operating officer, on strategic planning. 
<PERSON>Mr. Johnson</PERSON>, 45 years old, has been a consultant on strategy to <ORGANIZATION>Fannie Mae</ORGANIZATION> for the past 3 1/2 years.
<ORGANIZATION>Fannie Mae</ORGANIZATION> also said <PERSON>James A. Aliber</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>First Federal of Michigan</ORGANIZATION> and a director since 1985, moved up the date of his retirement from the board to accommodate <PERSON>Mr. Johnson</PERSON>'s election as a director.
Under the proposed agreement, Gold <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> holders will receive 1.43 Crown shares for each of the 1.1 million <ORGANIZATION>Gold Texas</ORGANIZATION> shares not owned by Crown, which already owns 65%. 
The arrangement is subject to approval by the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court of British Columbia</ORGANIZATION> province, <PERSON>Crown</PERSON> said.
<LOCATION>Gold Texas</LOCATION> is based in <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>British Columbia</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Crown Resources</ORGANIZATION> is based in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>.
The 200,000 shares are about 23% of <ORGANIZATION>Interferon</ORGANIZATION>'s common shares outstanding, excluding <ORGANIZATION>National Patent</ORGANIZATION>'s stake. 
Noting the recent <ORGANIZATION>Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION> approval of <ORGANIZATION>Interferon</ORGANIZATION>'s genital warts treatment, <ORGANIZATION>National Patent</ORGANIZATION> said it believes <ORGANIZATION>Interferon</ORGANIZATION>'s stock is undervalued. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> exports to <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> jumped 11.2% in August from July while <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> imports from <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> rose only 2.7%.
As a result, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s trade surplus with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> narrowed to C$656.5 million (US$558 million) in August from C$1.23 billion (US$1.04 billion) in July. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> exports benefited in August from heavy Canadian spending on new plant and equipment and a pickup in Canadian auto demand, <LOCATION>Canadian</LOCATION> officials said. 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, which do more trade than any other pair of nations, are to meet next month to arrange an acceleration of planned tariff cuts under the <LOCATION>U.S.-Canada</LOCATION> free trade agreement. 
For such businessmen, the Canadian government is organizing 55 missions this year to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> states bordering on <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> is planning to try out similar trips on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> businessmen in coming months under its <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> First! Outreach Program.
Participants in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> missions to <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> are to be assisted by members of the <ORGANIZATION>Service Corps of Retired Executives</ORGANIZATION>, a volunteer group, in dealing with their export challenges. 
The Canadian government also has recently opened new trade offices in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Princeton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, bringing the total number of such Canadian offices in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> to 27.
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> has six trade promotion offices in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. 
"This is one of the worst trade releases we've had since the dollar troughed out in 1987," said <PERSON>Geoffrey Dennis</PERSON>, chief international economist at <ORGANIZATION>James Capel Inc</ORGANIZATION>. Like most analysts, <PERSON>Mr. Dennis</PERSON> was hesitant to read too much into one month's numbers; but he said, "It indicates perhaps that the balance in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economy is not as good as we've been led to believe." 
"This bad trade number raises some deeper issues about the market decline," said <PERSON>Norman Robertson</PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION>Mellon Bank</ORGANIZATION>. "It raises questions about more deep-seated problems, the budget deficit and the trade deficit and the seeming lack of ability to come to grips with them." 
<ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Robert Mosbacher</PERSON> called the worsening trade figures "disappointing after two very good months." And <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON> said the deficit was "an unwelcome increase," adding that "we're hopeful that it simply is a one-month situation and will turn around." 
"The figures today add further evidence to support the view that the improvement in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade deficit has essentially stalled out at a level of about a $110 billion annual rate," said <PERSON>Jeffrey Scott</PERSON>, a research fellow at the <ORGANIZATION>Institute for International Economics</ORGANIZATION> here. "That's still an improvement over last year, but it leads one to conclude that basically we've gotten all the mileage we can out of past dollar depreciation and past marginal cuts in the federal budget deficit." 
At the same time, <PERSON>William T. Archey</PERSON>, international vice president at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>, notes: "Clearly the stronger dollar has made imports more attractive" by causing their prices to decline. 
"The best result we could get from these numbers would be to see the administration and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> get serious about putting the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> on an internationally competitive economic footing," said <PERSON>Howard Lewis</PERSON>, vice president of international economic affairs at the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Manufacturers</ORGANIZATION>. "That must start with cutting the federal budget deficit." 
*Newly industrialized countries: <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> 
<PERSON>Richard Bruno</PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION>OTC</ORGANIZATION> trading at <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION>, said the OTC market has a habit of lagging big moves on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>.
Much of the jockeying by <ORGANIZATION>OTC</ORGANIZATION> traders and investors centered on shares of companies that might be financially affected by damage from the devastating earthquake in northern <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
Traders said property-casualty companies with the heaviest exposure in the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> area include the <ORGANIZATION>OTC</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Safeco</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Ohio Casualty</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Frank Gilmartin</PERSON>, a trader who follows insurance stocks for <PERSON>Fox-Pitt Kelton</PERSON>, said his strategy was to sell early. 
Shares of <ORGANIZATION>Kasler</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> road and bridge builder, were heavily traded, jumping 2 1/8 to 9 7/8 on 1.3 million shares. 
<ORGANIZATION>Chiron</ORGANIZATION> was up 1/2 to 27 and <ORGANIZATION>Cetus</ORGANIZATION> gained 1/2 to 16 3/8. 
<ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> advanced 1 7/8 to 80 1/2 and <ORGANIZATION>Lotus Development</ORGANIZATION> added 1 1/4 to 32 1/2. 
In other earthquake-related news, <ORGANIZATION>Hambrecht & Quist</ORGANIZATION>'s OTC market makers were excused from trading yesterday and its positions were frozen for the day by the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Securities Dealers</ORGANIZATION>.
In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Roger Killion</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Hambrecht</ORGANIZATION> executive vice president, said he expects <ORGANIZATION>OTC</ORGANIZATION> trading at the company to resume this morning, either in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> or in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. 
Analysts in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> believe investors, despite their stampede to dump takeover stocks, should hold on tight to their <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shares, this newspaper's Heard on the Street column said yesterday. 
Analysts figure <ORGANIZATION>Amgen</ORGANIZATION> could benefit as a result of troubles facing its competitor, <ORGANIZATION>Genetics Institute</ORGANIZATION>, over the anti-anemia drug <ORGANIZATION>EPO</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Genetics Institute</ORGANIZATION> disclosed recently that it is embroiled in a dispute with <PERSON>Boehringer Mannheim</PERSON>, which distributes the drug, regarding the usability of some batches.

<ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the world's biggest auction house, is taking a huge Wall Street-style risk on the outcome of the sale of art from the estate of <PERSON>John T. Dorrance Jr.</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Soup Co.</ORGANIZATION> heir. 
<ORGANIZATION>The Financial Services</ORGANIZATION> division has guaranteed the <PERSON>Dorrance</PERSON> family that it will receive a minimum of $100 million for the collection, regardless of what the bids for the art works total, people close to the transaction say.
The collection, which includes two early <PERSON>Picassos</PERSON>, a van <PERSON>Gogh</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Monet</ORGANIZATION>, other paintings, furniture and porcelains, went on sale last night in the first of six auctions. 
<PERSON>Diana D. Brooks</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's North America</ORGANIZATION> division, vehemently denies it offered the Dorrance heirs a money-back guarantee, calling such reports "inaccurate." Buried in the glossy hardbound catalog for the sale, however, appears the statement, "Sotheby's has an interest in the property in this catalog." 
<PERSON>Frank Mirabello</PERSON>, a lawyer for the <LOCATION>Dorrance</LOCATION> estate with the <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION>Morgan, Lewis & Bockius</ORGANIZATION>, declines to comment on the financial arrangements. 
Sotheby's made the $100 million guarantee to keep the <ORGANIZATION>Dorrance</ORGANIZATION> collection away from its archrival, auction house <PERSON>Christie</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>International PLC</ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON>Christie</PERSON>'s has handled smaller sales for the <PERSON>Dorrance</PERSON> family over the years. 
When <PERSON>Christie</PERSON>'s officials asked why the firm wasn't picked to sell the <ORGANIZATION>Dorrance</ORGANIZATION> collection, representatives of the <PERSON>Dorrance</PERSON> family "told us it was a question of financial considerations," said <PERSON>Michael Findlay</PERSON>, <PERSON>Christie</PERSON>'s head of impressionist and modern paintings. 
In November 1987, <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s essentially offered a Wall Street-style "bridge loan" of about $27 million to <LOCATION>Australian</LOCATION> businessman <PERSON>Alan Bond</PERSON> to enable him to purchase <PERSON>Vincent van Gogh</PERSON>'s "Irises" for $53.9 million.
<ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s has been aggressively promoting the <LOCATION>Dorrance</LOCATION> sale.
The decision to put the entire collection on the block stunned many, since <PERSON>Mr. Dorrance</PERSON> had served as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Philadelphia Museum of Art</ORGANIZATION>, and it had been assumed many of the works would be donated to the institution. 
At last night's sale, 13 of 44 works that sold were purchased by <ORGANIZATION>Aska International Gallery</ORGANIZATION>, the art-acquisition unit of <ORGANIZATION>Aichi Financial</ORGANIZATION>, a Japanese conglomerate that owns 7.5% of <ORGANIZATION>Christie's</ORGANIZATION>. 
Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s guarantee is raising eyebrows in the art world. "The consumer has to throw out the idea that the auction house is a disinterested middleman," says <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> art dealer <PERSON>David Tunick</PERSON>.
"There's more and more of this cash-up-front going on at every level," says <PERSON>Bruce Miller</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Art Funding Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, an art lender.
In January, two small <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> galleries, the Coe <PERSON>Kerr Gallery</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Beadleston Fine Arts</ORGANIZATION>, snatched a major art collection owned by the <PERSON>Askin</PERSON> family away from rival auction-house bidders with an up-front payment of about $25 million. 
A <PERSON>Christie</PERSON>'s spokeswoman said that while the auction house sometimes waives its seller's commission to attract art works -- it still gets a commission from the buyer -- <PERSON>Christie</PERSON>'s won't offer financial guarantees because "<PERSON>Christie</PERSON>'s believes its primary role is as an auction house, and therefore as an agent {for buyer and seller}, not as a bank." 
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Morrison</ORGANIZATION> gained $2.25 to $44.125. 
Within minutes after the stock market closed Friday, I called <PERSON>Sen. Bill Bradley</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, advised him that the Dow Jones Industrial Average had declined by 190 points late that afternoon, and cheerfully informed him that he and his fellow Democrats were to blame. 
They had dealt a major setback that afternoon to President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s capital-gains tax cut proposal, which had seemed in the bag after it passed the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> overwhelmingly earlier in the month.
Denied a vote on substance, the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> leadership in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> on Friday morning was confronted with a hard choice.
The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION> has been in the forefront in supporting the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> proposal.
At noon Friday, a senior <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> official advised <PERSON>Richard Rahn</PERSON>, the Chamber's chief economist, that the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> would not agree to a budget reconciliation bill unless it had firm assurances that a vote on substance would be permitted in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Rahn</PERSON> was shocked, telephoning the office of <PERSON>Richard Darman</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Management and Budget</ORGANIZATION>, and the administration's chief strategist on this issue.
The stock market reacted as <PERSON>Mr. Rahn</PERSON> did, crumbling as it absorbed the news that <PERSON>Mr. Darman</PERSON>'s strategy had been abandoned.
<PERSON>Mr. Rahn</PERSON> was pointing out an elephant rumbling through Wall Street while conventional wisdom had fastened on the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> flea. 
If <PERSON>Sen. Bradley</PERSON> would permit a vote on capital gains, though, it would pass, Christmas retail sales would be strong instead of burdened by a falling stock market, the 1990 economy would be robust, and the revenue gains at every level of government, including <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>'s, would be surprisingly high.
<PERSON>Mr. Wanniski</PERSON> is president of <ORGANIZATION>Polyconomics Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>Morristown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION> 
<ORGANIZATION>The House Ethics Committee</ORGANIZATION> officially cited Rep. <PERSON>Jim Bates</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>) for sexually harassing two female employees, but didn't recommend formal disciplinary action. 
Rep. <PERSON>Bates</PERSON> said he accepted the finding, but one of the victims, <PERSON>Dorena Bertussi</PERSON>, denounced the ethics panel's action as "absurd." 
Acting more than a year after <PERSON>Ms. Bertussi</PERSON> filed a complaint, the panel issued a "letter of reproval" saying Rep. <PERSON>Bates</PERSON> had admitted conduct that violated a <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> rule forbidding discrimination against employees on account of their sex.
It ordered Rep. <PERSON>Bates</PERSON> to write letters of apology to <PERSON>Ms. Bertussi</PERSON> and to a second complainant, <PERSON>Karen Dryden</PERSON>. 
Rep. <PERSON>Bates</PERSON> said he would write the letters as ordered. "I accept the resolution of the matter by the <ORGANIZATION>Ethics Committee</ORGANIZATION>," he said. 
The panel also warned Rep. <PERSON>Bates</PERSON> that any further violations "may result in a recommendation that disciplinary action be considered." But <PERSON>Ms. Bertussi</PERSON> asked, "Who in their right mind is going to file another complaint with the <ORGANIZATION>Ethics Committee</ORGANIZATION>?" 
In the aftermath of the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> earthquake, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and his aides flew into a whirlwind of earthquake-related activity yesterday morning.
<PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> and his aides were accused of responding too slowly after the <PERSON>Exxon Valdez</PERSON> oil tanker split open in <LOCATION>Alaskan</LOCATION> waters and Hurricane Hugo struck the <LOCATION>Carolina</LOCATION> coast, and they clearly don't want a repeat of those charges now.
So the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> announced that <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> got his first earthquake briefing of the day at 6:30 a.m. from chief of staff <PERSON>John Sununu</PERSON>. 
By noon, <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> had taken two phone calls from Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>; made a televised statement of concern; signed a disaster proclamation; received a written report from the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Emergency Management Agency</ORGANIZATION>; and visited <ORGANIZATION>FEMA</ORGANIZATION> headquarters. 
On his <ORGANIZATION>FEMA</ORGANIZATION> visit, <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> said that he hoped there would be "less carping" about the emergency office's performance this time, adding that the agency "took a hit" for its reaction to Hurricane Hugo. 
The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> already is talking of <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> visiting the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> earthquake site this weekend.
<ORGANIZATION>Grumman Corp.</ORGANIZATION> was awarded a $53.1 million <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> contract for advanced acquisition of six E-2C tactical control aircraft. 
<ORGANIZATION>LTV Corp.</ORGANIZATION> won a $25 million <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> contract for missile test equipment. 
<ORGANIZATION>Unisys Corp.</ORGANIZATION> received a $24.4 million <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> contract for computer programming. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford Aerospace & Communications Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>, was awarded a $15.9 million <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> contract for computer improvements. 
<ORGANIZATION>Rockwell International Corp.</ORGANIZATION> was issued a $12.5 million <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> contract for changes in the <ORGANIZATION>National Aerospace Plane</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's Chevrolet division, reacting to slow sales, said it will offer $800 rebates on its 1990 <LOCATION>Beretta</LOCATION>, the two-door version of its core compact-car line. 
Sluggish sales of the <LOCATION>Beretta</LOCATION>, and its four-door sister car, the <LOCATION>Corsica</LOCATION>, prompted <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> to idle the two plants that build the automobiles for a total of three weeks this month.
The <LOCATION>Corsica</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Beretta</LOCATION> make up the highest-volume car line at Chevrolet, but sales of the vehicles are off 9.6% for the year, and fell a steep 34% during early October. 
The <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, thrift, which has $5.2 billion of assets, had net income in last year's third quarter of $1.8 million, or 23 cents a share.
The projects include construction of a 29,400 kilowatt waste-to-energy plant for <ORGANIZATION>Ada Cogeneration L.P.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Ada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>; a steam generating plant at <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, that <ORGANIZATION>Zurn</ORGANIZATION> will own and operate, and two waste-water control projects in <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.

In a management restructuring, <PERSON>Thomas L. Ringer</PERSON> resigned as chairman, chief executive and a director, while <ORGANIZATION>Israel Sheinberg</ORGANIZATION> resigned as a director.
<PERSON>Thomas M. Hurley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert A. Vanourek</PERSON>, who had been designated to take over <ORGANIZATION>Recognition</ORGANIZATION>'s top spots had Prospect's tender offer succeeded, were named co-chief executives and directors.
<PERSON>Mr. Hurley</PERSON> was formerly a vice president and general manager of an <ORGANIZATION>Avery International</ORGANIZATION> division; <PERSON>Mr. Vanourek</PERSON> was a former group vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Pitney Bowes Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
In addition, the agreement calls for <PERSON>Gilbert H. Lamphere</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Prospect Group</ORGANIZATION>'s executive committee, to be named chairman of a restructured board that will include four new independent directors.
Also named to the revised board was <PERSON>Thomas A. Loose</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Recognition</ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president and general counsel. 
Recognition also said it obtained a commitment from <ORGANIZATION>Chemical Bank</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Boston</ORGANIZATION> to convert an estimated $18 million in bank debt to a new, 24-month secured term loan to be repaid through the sale of certain assets. 
The company attributed the loss to declining revenue and litigation costs relating to criminal charges against the company and two former executives, <PERSON>William G. Moore Jr.</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert W. Reedy</PERSON>.
In August, soon after <ORGANIZATION>Wang Laboratories Inc.</ORGANIZATION> reported a staggering $424.3 million loss and replaced its president, two <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> sales representatives sent customers a letter saying: "We fully expect that you will soon be reading stories in the press reporting the `Amazing Comeback at <PERSON>Wang</PERSON>. '" 
"If your prospect is feeling risk the whole time and you're not feeling as if you're backed up by a stable company, you've lost it before you've begun," says <PERSON>Mary Ann Cluggish</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Wellesley</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, sales trainer and consultant who works with high technology companies. 
Consider the difficulties faced by <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> salespeople when the car was tainted by false charges of sudden acceleration, or Exxon dealers' problems in the wake of the <LOCATION>Valdez</LOCATION> oil spill. 
Like thousands of salespeople before them, <PERSON>Wang</PERSON>'s are finding ways to combat the bad news. "It's very important that we exude confidence, even though within the family we know there's a lot of hard work ahead," said <PERSON>Richard Miller</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Lowell</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, computer concern's new president, in a video message to salespeople a month after he took over. 
After the company reported red ink for the fiscal third quarter, <PERSON>Wang</PERSON>'s marketing department provided the sales force answers to questions such as "How could you not have known you were going to lose $55 million?" and "Is <PERSON>Wang</PERSON> still a viable company?" 
Responding to such questions is "defensive," says <PERSON>Kenneth Olissa</PERSON>, <PERSON>Wang</PERSON>'s vice president, marketing. "That's antithetical to the art of selling." Moreover, he notes that analyzing financial results "poses a problem for a salesman who isn't particularly familiar with a balance sheet." 
<PERSON>Mike Metschan</PERSON>, a salesman in <LOCATION>Wang</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, office, has a breezier method: "We tell them $3 billion companies don't go out of business.
Although <PERSON>Wang</PERSON> will report a loss for the first quarter ended Sept. 30 and the full fiscal year, <PERSON>Mr. Miller</PERSON> says he expects the company will return to profitability by the fourth quarter. 
Experts on sales technique say anyone representing a troubled company must walk a fine line. "If a salesman jeopardizes his credibility in this time of trouble, it will be a problem for the long run," says <PERSON>George Palmatier</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Minden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>, sales consultant and author of "The Marketing Edge." 
Still, says <PERSON>John Sullivan</PERSON>, a management recruiter with <ORGANIZATION>Daniel Roberts Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, who has held senior sales positions at <LOCATION>Polaroid</LOCATION> and Atari: "The customer will react to strength.
For buyers, "these are career-risking decisions," says <PERSON>Jean Conlin</PERSON>, who supervises a network of <PERSON>Wang</PERSON> computers in the admissions department at <ORGANIZATION>Boston University</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Wang</PERSON>'s overall product line is "still not as good as other vendors, but they've come a long way," says <PERSON>Steven Wendler</PERSON>, a consultant with market researcher <ORGANIZATION>Gartner Group</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Stamford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION> "They were on the road to recovery in terms of customer attitudes until this bad quarter happened." 
But even before <PERSON>Wang</PERSON>'s latest financial troubles surfaced, some customers "were trying to wall off their <PERSON>Wang</PERSON> installations" so other departments wouldn't add <PERSON>Wang</PERSON>, says <PERSON>Chris Christiansen</PERSON>, a former <PERSON>Wang</PERSON> marketer who is now a market analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Meta Group</ORGANIZATION>, a market research firm in <LOCATION>Stamford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn</LOCATION>. 
One <PERSON>Wang</PERSON> salesman who left the company in July recalls that when he tried to sell products to <PERSON>Eastman Kodak</PERSON>, he worked "to muster support from internal allies," but "those allies became skeptical as they saw the downtrend.
<PERSON>Rick Lynch</PERSON>, a former top salesman in <PERSON>Wang</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> office, referring to <PERSON>Wang</PERSON>'s mainstay computer line, says: "You can't sell a VS to a new customer." <PERSON>Mr. Lynch</PERSON> left <PERSON>Wang</PERSON> this summer for <ORGANIZATION>Oracle Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a software vendor. 
<PERSON>William Tait</PERSON>, a former sales manager in <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION>, says that his office had all but sold a $1.5 million image system to pharmaceutical maker <ORGANIZATION>Eli Lilly & Co.</ORGANIZATION> "When they were making the decision, all hell broke loose with the finances." He says the <ORGANIZATION>Lilly</ORGANIZATION> executives told him they couldn't take the risk with <PERSON>Wang</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Tait</PERSON> say he doesn't blame <ORGANIZATION>Lilly</ORGANIZATION>.
Buyers have to rely on a supplier "continually upgrading and replacing the product," he says. "When a company realizes that, it's hard to go with <PERSON>Wang</PERSON>." For <PERSON>Mr. Tait</PERSON>, who says he used to earn as much as $150,000 a year at <PERSON>Wang</PERSON>, it was one more reason to quit.
He is now president of <ORGANIZATION>Eastate Homes Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION> contractor. 
<PERSON>Brian Petre</PERSON>, a former <PERSON>Wang</PERSON> salesman in upstate <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, says: "You have pride in your job.
Discouragement feeds on itself. "The problem is, if people get down in the dumps, they stop selling," says <PERSON>Mike Durcan</PERSON>, a laid-off sales manager in <LOCATION>Wang</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION> office. 
<PERSON>Paul Hellman</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Framingham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, sales and management consultant and author of "Ready, Aim, You're Hired," says: "The bad news is, you'll be rejected more.
But <PERSON>Mr. Miller</PERSON>, <PERSON>Wang</PERSON>'s new president, recently warned his salespeople about negativism. "Our customers watch us for the hidden message," he said. "Look a customer right in the eye and say, `I'm glad to be at <PERSON>Wang</PERSON>. '" 
<PERSON>Egon Krenz</PERSON>, the man tapped yesterday to become <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>'s new leader, faces the same task that has fallen to neighboring socialist colleagues: reforming a country in crisis.
But unlike the other new leaders in the <LOCATION>East Bloc</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON> will face an immediate threat to his nation's very existence: German reunification. 
<PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON>, age 52, is known as an old-guard ironfist, one likely to continue the method of running a country that the <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> Wall made famous.
<PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON> almost certainly will be a younger version of <PERSON>Erich Honecker</PERSON>, his rigid predecessor as dictator.
<PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON> has followed much the same career path as <PERSON>Mr. Honecker</PERSON>: Both spent years overseeing the <PERSON>Freie Deutsche Jugend</PERSON>, the youth group that is the communist regime's principal tool for stamping young Germans into socialist citizens.
More recently, <PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON> has been in charge of East German security, and is the youngest member of the ruling <ORGANIZATION>Politburo</ORGANIZATION>. 
Faced with another <PERSON>Mr. Honecker</PERSON>, so many despairing East Germans are likely to flee that the two German peoples will get their reunification, de facto, on <LOCATION>West German</LOCATION> ground.
But if <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>'s arthritic <LOCATION>Politburo</LOCATION> does loosen up enough to permit <PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON> to make serious efforts at reform, he will face a challenge just as fundamental.
In this scenario it's hard to imagine that a pale imitation of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Republic</ORGANIZATION> could avoid being pulled into some kind of tie -- economic, federal or stronger -- with <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>. 
Cartoonists in <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> have already mocked the exodus by imagining an advertisement placed by <PERSON>Mr. Honecker</PERSON>: "Wanted: one people." The West German embassies in <LOCATION>Prague</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Budapest</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION> are continuing to find refugees at their gates. 
But with world-wide opinion -- even, apparently in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> -- against <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>, the country would have to turn itself into an <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION> to clamp down further on refugees. 
There have been some reports that <PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON> is moving to "soften" his reputation, notably rumors that it was he who kept <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>'s state police off protesters' backs at the country's dismal 40th anniversary celebrations earlier this month.
But even if he effects a <ORGANIZATION>Hyde-to-Jekyll</ORGANIZATION> transformation, he will face a serious ideological crisis and <ORGANIZATION>Reunification Scenario Two</ORGANIZATION>. 
The problem is one that <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> shares with other half-states, such as <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION>, but one it must shoulder alone in the <LOCATION>East Bloc</LOCATION>.
When <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> moves to reform, it can at least lean on its past: However flawed and short-lived <PERSON>Joseph Pilsudski</PERSON>'s interwar republic, it was a nonsocialist democracy.
Even the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> has Peter the <LOCATION>Great</LOCATION> to rediscover, should it choose to.
But <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> is merely "the land of truly existing socialism." Beyond that, it has to compete with <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> for a claim to the <LOCATION>German</LOCATION> identity.
With talk today of a second economic miracle in <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> no longer can content itself with being the economic star in a loser league.
Without <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>'s military and party behind it, <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> runs the risk of disintegrating.
The protesters who greeted <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON> at <LOCATION>East Berlin</LOCATION>'s airport earlier this month weren't shouting "Go <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>A" -- they were chanting "Gorby, Help Us." 
But it would be ironic if <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s reunification, just like its division, eventually were the result of actions in centers of power other than <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>. 
In a statement that was as close as <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> gets to practicing "glasnost", <PERSON>Otto Reinhold</PERSON>, an East German party theorist, actually acknowledged the reunification dilemma. "The main problem," <PERSON>Mr. Reinhold</PERSON> said in an East German radio interview monitored by <ORGANIZATION>Radio Free Europe</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Munich</LOCATION>, stems from the fact that "the <ORGANIZATION>GDR</ORGANIZATION> is different" from other East European states. "What kind of right to exist," he asked, "would a capitalist German Democratic Republic have alongside a capitalist <ORGANIZATION>Federal Republic</ORGANIZATION>?" That's a question <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> can't answer easily, no matter what its new leader does. 
The commission, which was asked to study the deal by the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Trade and Industry</ORGANIZATION> after its announcement in February, said the diversity of global supply of chemicals used in making analgesic drugs was great enough to offset the dominant <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> market share <ORGANIZATION>Rhone-Poulenc</ORGANIZATION> would gain through the acquisition. 
The commission found that if the British government attempted to block the merger, <ORGANIZATION>Rhone-Poulenc</ORGANIZATION> would likely respond by closing the salicylates plant <ORGANIZATION>Monsanto</ORGANIZATION> operates in <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION>, removing the matter from <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> jurisdiction. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> steel imports in August fell 14% from a year earlier to 1,531,000 tons, according to the <ORGANIZATION>American Iron and Steel Institute</ORGANIZATION>. 
The latest month's figures show that imports of steel from <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> nations fell to 466,000 tons from 481,000 a month earlier, while imports from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> rose to 323,000 tons from 288,000 in July.
<ORGANIZATION>Morgan Grenfell Group PLC</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>John Craven</PERSON>, group chief executive officer, is taking over the chairmanship of the merchant banking group from Sir <PERSON>Peter Carey</PERSON>, who is retiring. 
<PERSON>Mr. Craven</PERSON> is widely credited with refocusing <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Grenfell</ORGANIZATION>'s energies on its core corporate finance, fund management and banking activities over the past year.
Last year, <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Grenfell</ORGANIZATION> shut down its ailing <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> securities operations. 
<PERSON>Mr. Craven</PERSON> joined <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Grenfell</ORGANIZATION> as group chief executive in May 1987, a few months after the resignations of former Chief Executive <PERSON>Christopher Reeves</PERSON> and other top officials because of the merchant bank's role in <ORGANIZATION>Guinness PLC</ORGANIZATION>'s controversial takeover of <ORGANIZATION>Distiller's Co.</ORGANIZATION> in 1986. 
<ORGANIZATION>Morgan Grenfell</ORGANIZATION> had advised <ORGANIZATION>Guinness</ORGANIZATION> on the bid, which was surrounded by allegations that <ORGANIZATION>Guinness</ORGANIZATION> used artificial means to support the bid's value. 
<ORGANIZATION>Morgan Grenfell</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Michael Dobson</PERSON>, currently group deputy chief executive, will assume the chief executive position. 
News of <PERSON>Mr. Eward</PERSON>'s retirement comes one day after <ORGANIZATION>Morgan</ORGANIZATION> said that <PERSON>Christopher Whittington</PERSON> resigned as chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Morgan</ORGANIZATION>'s banking subsidiary to join a financial services firm. 
<PERSON>Eward</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Whittington</LOCATION> had planned to leave the bank earlier, but <PERSON>Mr. Craven</PERSON> had persuaded them to remain until the bank was in a healthy position. "If there's any coincidence about the departures it's that they are leaving at a time when the business is in reasonably good shape and going forward very well." Last month, <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Grenfell</ORGANIZATION> announced its pretax profit rose 49.6% to #32.8 million in the first half, boosted by a healthy growth in its domestic and international corporate finance business. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>Ethyl</ORGANIZATION> closed at $25.875 a share, up 12.5 cents. 
<ORGANIZATION>Loral Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it received a $325 million order from <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Defense</ORGANIZATION>, the largest contract the company ever has received. 
<ORGANIZATION>Loral</ORGANIZATION> will provide to <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> an electronic countermeasures system for its fleet of F-16 aircraft.
<ORGANIZATION>Loral</ORGANIZATION> said the contract with <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> will provide opportunities for <LOCATION>Loral</LOCATION> to supply that country with other defense systems. 
<ORGANIZATION>Beazer PLC</ORGANIZATION>, a major British building materials and construction concern, reported a 24% jump in pretax profit for its latest financial year, helped largely by contributions from its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unit, <ORGANIZATION>Koppers Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Arizona Corporations Commission</ORGANIZATION> authorized an 11.5% rate increase at <ORGANIZATION>Tucson Electric Power Co.</ORGANIZATION>, substantially lower than recommended last month by a commission hearing officer and barely half the rise sought by the utility. 
The ruling follows a host of problems at <ORGANIZATION>Tucson Electric</ORGANIZATION>, including major write-downs, a 60% slash in the common stock dividend and the departure of former Chairman <PERSON>Einar Greve</PERSON> during a company investigation of his stock sales. 
<ORGANIZATION>Tucson Electric</ORGANIZATION> closed at $20.875 a share, down 25 cents, in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading. 
That was the question structural engineers and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> transportation officials were asking themselves yesterday as rescue workers began the gruesome task of trying to extract as many as 250 victims from beneath the concrete slabs of the double-deck <ORGANIZATION>Nimitz Freeway</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> that caved in during Tuesday's temblor. 
After touring the area, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>George Deukmejian</PERSON> late yesterday called for an inquiry into the freeway's collapse, blaming the disaster on substandard construction, the <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> reported. 
It could easily be two years before the well-traveled artery that helps connect <ORGANIZATION>Oakland</ORGANIZATION> with <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> is reopened, and the cost to build a new stretch of highway could soar to more than $250 million, said <PERSON>Charles J. O'Connell</PERSON>, deputy district director in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> of the <ORGANIZATION>California Department of Transportation</ORGANIZATION>, nicknamed Caltrans.
The aftershocks of the highway tragedy are reverberating in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> as well, as local politicians spoke yesterday against plans to bring double-decking to <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> freeways by 1994.
<LOCATION>Los Angeles County</LOCATION> Supervisor <PERSON>Kenneth Hahn</PERSON> yesterday vowed to fight the introduction of double-decking in the area. 
Caltrans abandoned double-decking in the early 1970s, following the 1971 Sylmar earthquake that destroyed freeway sections just north of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. O'Connell</PERSON> explained.
So why even consider stacking freeways now? "We've run out of places to build freeways in <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION>, and the only place to go is up," <PERSON>Mr. O'Connell</PERSON> said, although he acknowledges there are many obstacles, including cost.
While the pillars did have long metal bars running vertically through them for reinforcement, they apparently lacked an adequate number of metal "ties" that run horizontally through the column, said <PERSON>Leo Parker</PERSON>, a structural engineer in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
Caltrans spokesman <PERSON>Jim Drago</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> declined to identify the engineering firm that did the reinforcement work. 
Liability in the bridge and road collapses will revolve around whether government took "reasonable care" to build and maintain the structures, says <PERSON>John Messina</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Tacoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, personal-injury attorney who specializes in highway design and maintenance cases.
<ORGANIZATION>Caltrans</ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON>Mr. Drago</PERSON> defended the agency's work on the <ORGANIZATION>Nimitz Freeway</ORGANIZATION>. "The work was done properly," he said. "Basically, we had a severe earthquake of significant duration and it was just something the structure couldn't withstand."

The verdict, reached late last week in <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION>, may end an eight-year legal battle for the <LOCATION>Greensboro</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, carpet maker. 
<PERSON>Glenn</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sharon Beebe</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> had sued the com- pany in 1981 after installing <LOCATION>Burlington</LOCATION> carpets in their office.
<PERSON>Anthony J. Iaciofano</PERSON>, a lawyer for <LOCATION>Burlington</LOCATION>, said the company believes the <ORGANIZATION>Beebes</ORGANIZATION>' symptoms were not related to the carpeting.
<PERSON>Catherine Adams</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Beebes</ORGANIZATION>' lawyer, said the verdict would not discourage other plaintiffs from filing such suits.
But the <ORGANIZATION>Beebes</ORGANIZATION> didn't come to that conclusion until time limits had elapsed for adding the adhesives maker as a defendant in the case, <PERSON>Ms. Adams</PERSON> said. 
The Appellate Division of <ORGANIZATION>New York State Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> dismissed six lawsuits attempting to block a $2.5 billion project planned for 42nd Street in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>. 
State officials said the court's ruling clears the way for proceedings to condemn buildings in the area. "This project is ready to move," said <ORGANIZATION>State Urban Development Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON>Vincent Tese</PERSON>. 
As part of the agreement with the state, the developers -- a partnership of Park Tower Realty and <ORGANIZATION>Prudential Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> -- said they would not proceed with condemnation proceedings while there was "significant litigation" pending. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Jack B. Weinstein</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, ruled that a man implicated in an attack on an Israeli passenger bus in 1986 can be extradited to <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> for trial. 
To do so, the judge said, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> courts must review the judicial process in the foreign country independently of the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION>'s assessment.
He said that in this case he concurred with the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION>'s decision that <PERSON>Mr. Ahmad</PERSON> should be extradited.
"Up until now the courts have said it is not their role to supervise the foreign country's courts," said <PERSON>Jacques Semmelman</PERSON>, the assistant <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney on the case.

QUOTABLE: In a speech prepared for delivery in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> yesterday, retired Justice <PERSON>Lewis Powell</PERSON> contested the notion that the last <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> term marked a turn toward conservatism: "Commentators who agreed on little else unanimously proclaimed a `shift in direction' on the court. . . . I take these pronouncements, like many that have preceded them in past years, with a grain of salt.
<ORGANIZATION>StatesWest Airlines</ORGANIZATION> said it submitted an offer to the directors of <ORGANIZATION>Mesa Airlines</ORGANIZATION> to acquire the <LOCATION>Farmington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.M.</LOCATION>, carrier. 
Except to characterize its offer as "fair and generous and in the best interests of <ORGANIZATION>Mesa</ORGANIZATION> shareholders," <ORGANIZATION>StatesWest</ORGANIZATION> declined to discuss details of its proposal.
Last week, <ORGANIZATION>Mesa</ORGANIZATION> rejected a proposal by <ORGANIZATION>StatesWest</ORGANIZATION> to acquire it or merge. 
<ORGANIZATION>StatesWest</ORGANIZATION> has a 7.25% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Mesa</ORGANIZATION>, which operates 20 twin-engine and two single-engine turboprops among 42 cities in <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.

The public sector borrowing requirement, the most widely used measure of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s government deficit or surplus, showed a deficit of #200 million in September, compared with a deficit of #765 million in August and a deficit of #1.08 billion in September 1988, the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> said. 
In a <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> filing, <PERSON>Mr. Ruskin</PERSON> had said that holders of the other 45% of <ORGANIZATION>United Merchants</ORGANIZATION> would receive one-half share of a new preferred stock for each of their shares. 
In a separate <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> filing, <PERSON>Albert Safer</PERSON>, who holds 6.46% of <ORGANIZATION>United Merchants</ORGANIZATION>, said he retained investment bank <ORGANIZATION>Lazard Freres & Co.</ORGANIZATION> for advice as he evaluates the possibility of making a bid for the textile maker.
On Friday, <PERSON>Mr. Safer</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, textile businessman, signed a confidentiality agreement under which <ORGANIZATION>United Merchants</ORGANIZATION> would provide him with nonpublic information. 
<ORGANIZATION>Blinder International Enterprises Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the parent of beleaguered penny-stockbroker <PERSON>Blinder</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Robinson & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, said its shareholders approved a previously announced name change to <ORGANIZATION>Intercontinental Enterprises Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
"The parent company is diversifying into other industries around the world," said president <PERSON>Meyer Blinder</PERSON> in explaining the name change. "Everytime we talked about Blinder International, {people} thought it was the brokerage house." <PERSON>Mr. Blinder</PERSON> said the change wasn't related to the brokerage's recent troubles, which have included sharp declines in earnings, run-ins with the securities regulators and lawsuits by former customers. 
<PERSON>Charles S. Mitchell</PERSON>, a vice president with <ORGANIZATION>Homart Development Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the real estate development subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Sears, Roebuck & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, was named president of <ORGANIZATION>Figgie Properties</ORGANIZATION>, a real estate development unit.

The slaughter in <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> was very much on the minds of 450 editors and publishers from <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> attending the 45th general assembly of the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-American Press Association</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Monterrey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, this week.
On Tuesday the conference got word of another atrocity, the assassination in <LOCATION>Medellin</LOCATION> of two employees of <LOCATION>El Espectador</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>'s second-largest newspaper.
The drug lords who claimed responsibility said they would blow up the <LOCATION>Bogota</LOCATION> newspaper's offices if it continued to distribute in <LOCATION>Medellin</LOCATION>.
At <LOCATION>Monterrey</LOCATION>, publisher <PERSON>Luis Gabriel Cano</PERSON>, although shaken by the murders, issued a statement saying: "We will not cease our fight against drug trafficking.
They want to terrify the press and in particular <ORGANIZATION>El Espectador</ORGANIZATION> because it has always been a torchbearer in this war." This comes from a man whose brother, <LOCATION>Guillermo</LOCATION>, was murdered in 1986. 
The report charged that <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Manuel Noriega</PERSON> is not only in league with the drug traffickers but also is bullying the press as never before. "<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> has closed every independent newspaper, radio and television station and arrested, tortured or forced into exile a long list of reporters," the statement declared. 
It added: "In <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>, public enemy No. 1 of press freedoms in the hemisphere, repression of journalists both <LOCATION>Cuban</LOCATION> and foreign is worse than ever." And in <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>, promises of press freedom by the Sandinistas "have not materialized." 
As it happens, the four countries cited, <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>, are not only where the press is under greatest attack but also are linked by the drug trade and left-wing politics.
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> is close to <PERSON>Castro</PERSON> and may once have been his agent.
<PERSON>Sandinistas Thomas Borge</PERSON> and the <LOCATION>Ortega</LOCATION> brothers are <PERSON>Castro</PERSON> proteges; he backed their takeover of <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>.
In <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>, the drug-financed guerrillas trying to seize the country and destroy democracy include M-19, which <PERSON>Castro</PERSON> has clearly backed. 
<PERSON>Robert Merkel</PERSON>, a former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney handling drug indictments in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, doesn't think for a minute that <PERSON>Castro</PERSON>'s much publicized trials of high officials engaged in the drug trade mean he has broken off with the <LOCATION>Medellin</LOCATION> drug cartel. "If the cartel succeeds in blackmailing the <LOCATION>Colombian</LOCATION> authorities into negotiations, the cartel will be in control and <ORGANIZATION>Fidel</ORGANIZATION> can exploit his past relationships with them," he told the <ORGANIZATION>Journal</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>David Asman</PERSON> recently. 
He will probably be extradited to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> for trial under an extradition treaty President <PERSON>Virgilia Barco</PERSON> has revived.
<PERSON>Mr. Barco</PERSON> has refused <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops or advisers but has accepted <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military aid. 
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has agreed to meet within 90 days with <PERSON>Mr. Barco</PERSON>, President <PERSON>Alan Garcia</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> and President <PERSON>Jaime Paz Zamora</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Bolivia</LOCATION> to discuss the drug problem.
And several regional banks, including <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Boston Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>First Bank System Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, are expected to report losses stemming from major additions to reserves for foundering domestic loans. 
The nation's biggest banking company, <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>, isn't expected to follow the lead of Manufacturers, <PERSON>Chase</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Morgan</ORGANIZATION> with a massive boost in reserves.
<ORGANIZATION>Hooker International</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Seaman Furniture Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Lomas Financial Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Integrated Resources Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Resorts International Inc.</ORGANIZATION> are some of the more prominent troubled concerns. 
<ORGANIZATION>American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ORGANIZATION> is expected to post a profit increase of about 18% and <ORGANIZATION>MCI Communications Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's earnings are expected to surge 58%. 
<PERSON>Paul Aran</PERSON>, a telecommunications analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Bear, Stearns & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, said the long-distance companies have been buoyed by strong growth in the facsimile and data-service business.
Growth is predicted to be in the 1% to 2% range for most companies, with <ORGANIZATION>Southern New England Telephone</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>GTE Corp.</ORGANIZATION> posting profit increases in the neighborhood of 10%. 
"The long-distance companies have kept their momentum," says <PERSON>Robert Morris III</PERSON>, a telecommunications analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, "while the pace of growth for the local telephone companies is slowing." That's especially true for the regional <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> companies. 
<ORGANIZATION>Pacific Telesis Group</ORGANIZATION>, which is expected to post earnings of about 75 cents a share, obtained regulatory relief from <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> regulators last week.
However, <ORGANIZATION>GTE</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Telesis</ORGANIZATION>, which operate in territories with hearty economies, are expected to report new-telephone-line growth in the range of 4% to 5%.
<ORGANIZATION>Nynex Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's profits could begin to show signs of weakening from the effects of a nearly three-month strike, while other <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> companies, such as <ORGANIZATION>Ameritech</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southwestern Bell Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, could be hurt in the quarter by one-time charges associated with the settlement of new union contracts. 
<PERSON>Mr. Aran</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Bear Stearns</ORGANIZATION> analyst, said that generally, after eight weeks, "A strike starts hurting earnings.
<ORGANIZATION>PepsiCo Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Anheuser-Busch Cos.</ORGANIZATION> will report third-quarter earnings gains of at least 9% and 14%, respectively, while results for <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Adolph Coors Co.</ORGANIZATION> will decline, analysts estimate. 
Because raw material costs have been escalating and because <ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Pepsi</PERSON> have become bigger owners of bottling businesses, the companies have been raising soda pop prices in recent months. 
In August, <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola Enterprises</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION>'s largest bottling operation, said its 1989 earnings would fall as much as 37%, partly because it misjudged consumer resistance to the new prices, which were 2% to 3% higher on average in July and August.
After a controversial flap involving a <LOCATION>Madonna</LOCATION> music video, <PERSON>Pepsi</PERSON> dropped its plans for a big summer advertising promotion featuring the pop singer.
"What's been hot in the soft-drink business lately?" asks <PERSON>Emanuel Goldman</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "Nothing." 
Still, the beverage industry's slower results in the latest quarter could lead to some positive earnings surprises in next year's third quarter, when comparisons will be easier, said <PERSON>George Thompson</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "This year's ugly ducklings will be next year's swans," he said. 
On the strength of Bud Light, <PERSON>Busch</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michelob Dry</PERSON>, the company's volume in the quarter is estimated to increase about 3% to 4%, while the rest of the industry will be flat, or up slightly.
Troubled British defense contractor <ORGANIZATION>Ferranti International Signal PLC</ORGANIZATION> replaced the head of its scandal-plagued <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> division. 
<PERSON>Ferranti</PERSON> said <PERSON>Joseph Zilligen</PERSON>, 49 years old, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Ferranti International USA</ORGANIZATION>, is "relinquishing" his post.
Succeeding him as chairman of the large, <ORGANIZATION>Lancaster</ORGANIZATION>, Pa.-based unit, is a longtime <ORGANIZATION>Ferranti</ORGANIZATION> executive, <PERSON>Albert Dodd</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr. Dodd</PERSON>, a 53-year-old Briton, is a <ORGANIZATION>Ferranti</ORGANIZATION> board member and managing director of <ORGANIZATION>Ferranti</ORGANIZATION>'s instrumentation division. 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unit is at the center of what <PERSON>Ferranti</PERSON> has called a "serious fraud" that has rocked the <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> company for the past month.
The falsified figures inflated <ORGANIZATION>International Signal</ORGANIZATION>'s reported assets, and increased the price <ORGANIZATION>Ferranti</ORGANIZATION> paid when it bought the company, according to <ORGANIZATION>Ferranti</ORGANIZATION> officials. 
<ORGANIZATION>British Aerospace PLC</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s Thomson-CSF <ORGANIZATION>S.A.</ORGANIZATION> are leading contenders for a joint <ORGANIZATION>Ferranti</ORGANIZATION> bid.
Yesterday, a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> brokerage firm, <ORGANIZATION>Hoare Govett Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, confirmed that it purchased on Wednesday 5.7 million Ferranti shares at 56 pence (87 cents) apiece on behalf of <ORGANIZATION>British Aerospace</ORGANIZATION>.
A <ORGANIZATION>Ferranti</ORGANIZATION> spokesman declined to comment on whether the management shuffle is related to the financial scandal, but called it generally part of the "integration" of International Signal into <ORGANIZATION>Ferranti</ORGANIZATION> since the 1988 merger.
He said <PERSON>Mr. Zilligen</PERSON> remains a <ORGANIZATION>Ferranti</ORGANIZATION> director, but will also be succeeded by <PERSON>Mr. Dodd</PERSON> as chief executive of <LOCATION>Ferranti Italia</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Zilligen</PERSON>, through a spokesman in <LOCATION>Lancaster</LOCATION>, declined to comment.
The executive was a colleague since 1980 of <ORGANIZATION>International Signal</ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON>James Guerin</PERSON>, who left <ORGANIZATION>International Signal</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ferranti</ORGANIZATION> last spring. 
"This will be the worst quarter since the third quarter of 1987, when steel companies were just on their way up," predicted <PERSON>John Tumazos</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
"We are in the midst of a very severe price drop that will really hit in the fourth quarter," said <PERSON>Peter Marcus</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Christopher Plummer</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>WEFA Group</ORGANIZATION>, noted that the capital goods market, which had been stronger than automotive and appliance markets, is showing signs of weakness as well.
<PERSON>Charles Bradford</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ORGANIZATION>, predicts <LOCATION>Bethlehem</LOCATION> earnings dropped more than two-thirds to about 50 cents a share, from $2.35 a year ago, excluding major nonrecurring items. 
One wild card in <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION>'s future earnings is investor <PERSON>Carl Icahn</PERSON>, who boosted his stake in <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> and is urging more restructuring. 
<ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Bradford</PERSON> said, "We haven't seen the pickup in flat rolled orders that we should have." Flat rolled steel is the industry's major product. 
<PERSON>John Jacobson</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>AUS Consultants</ORGANIZATION>, also said he believes steel production costs are coming down because of increased efficiencies at major mills. 
In composite <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Cummins</ORGANIZATION> shares stumbled $2 to close at $52.
But "an eerie silence pervaded" the junk market Friday as prices tumbled on hundreds of high-yield bonds despite "no active trading," says <PERSON>John Lonski</PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
For example, the price of <ORGANIZATION>Southland Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's $500 million of 16 3/4% bonds due 2002 -- sold less than two years ago by <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ORGANIZATION> -- plummeted 25% to just 30 cents on the dollar.
But not even <ORGANIZATION>Goldman</ORGANIZATION> would make a market in the securities of <LOCATION>Southland</LOCATION>, the owner of the nationwide chain of 7-11 convenience stores that is strapped for cash.
The shaky market received its biggest jolt last month from <ORGANIZATION>Campeau Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which created its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> retailing empire with junk financing.
<ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION> developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdales</ORGANIZATION> department-store chain up for sale. 
Now, dozens of corporations, including <PERSON>Ethan Allen</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>TW Services and York International</ORGANIZATION>, that are counting on at least $7 billion of scheduled new junk financings to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy-outs afloat, may never get the money. "The music has stopped playing," says <PERSON>Michael Harkins</PERSON>, a principal in the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION>Levy Harkins</ORGANIZATION>. "You've either got a chair or you don't." 
In Friday's aftermath, says <PERSON>R. Douglas Carleton</PERSON>, a director of high-yield finance at <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, "much of the $7 billion forward calendar could be deferred, depending on the hysteria." In August, <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION> withdrew a $475 million junk offering of <ORGANIZATION>Ohio Mattress</ORGANIZATION> bonds because potential buyers were "very skittish." 
The outlook "looks shaky because we're still waiting" for mutual funds, in particular, to dump some of their junk bond holdings to pay off redemptions by individual investors, says <PERSON>King Penniman</PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION>McCarthy</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Crisanti & Maffei</ORGANIZATION>, an investment arm of <ORGANIZATION>Xerox Financial Services</ORGANIZATION>.
The main catalyst for government bond market rally was the 190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. "When you get panic in one market, you get flight to quality in the other," said <PERSON>Maria Ramirez</PERSON>, money market economist at <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
Nevertheless, the problems of the junk market could prompt the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> to ease credit in the months ahead. "This marks a significant shift in the interest rate outlook," says <PERSON>William Sullivan</PERSON>, director of money market research at <ORGANIZATION>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Robert Dow</PERSON>, a partner and portfolio manager at <ORGANIZATION>Lord, Abbett & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which manages $4 billion of high-yield bonds, says he doesn't "think there is any fundamental economic rationale {for the junk bond rout}.
For example, a recent $375 million offering of <ORGANIZATION>Petrolane Gas Services L.P.</ORGANIZATION> bonds sold by <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION> was three times oversubscribed.
A $550 million offering of <ORGANIZATION>Turner Broadcasting System Inc.</ORGANIZATION> high-yield securities sold last week by <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> was increased $50 million because of strong demand. 
<ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION> estimates that in November and December alone, junk bond investors will receive $4.8 billion of coupon interest payments. "That's a clear indication that there is and will be an undercurrent of basic business going on," says <PERSON>Mr. Carleton</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION>. 
"I don't know how people can say the junk bond market disappeared when there were $1.5 billion of orders for $550 million of junk bonds sold last week by Turner," says <PERSON>Raymond Minella</PERSON>, co-head of merchant banking at <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION> "When the rally comes, insurance companies will be leading it because they have billions to invest and invest they will.
<PERSON>Michael McNamara</PERSON>, director of fixed-income research at <ORGANIZATION>Kemper Financial Services</ORGANIZATION>, says the quality of junk issues has been getting poorer, contributing to the slide in prices. 
For the moment, investors seem more preoccupied with the "bad" junk than the "good" junk. "The market has been weak since" the announcement of the <ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION> cash squeeze and the company's subsequent bailout by <ORGANIZATION>Olympia & York</ORGANIZATION>, says <PERSON>Mr. Minella</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION>. "That really affected the market in that people started to ask 'What else is in trouble? '" 
-- In July, <ORGANIZATION>Southmark Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the Dallas-based real estate and financial services company with about $1.3 billion of junk bonds, voluntarily filed for protection under <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> bankruptcy law. -- By the end of July, the difference in yield between an index of junk bonds and seven-year <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> notes widened to more than 5.5 percentage points. 
-- In September, just as the cash squeeze hit <ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Lomas Financial Corp.</ORGANIZATION> defaulted on $145 million of notes and appeared unlikely to pay interest on a total of $1.2 billion of debt securities. 
"The era of the 1980s is about compound interest and the reaching for it," says <PERSON>James Grant</PERSON>, editor of <PERSON>Grant</PERSON>'s Interest Rate Observer, an early critic of the junk bond market. "What we've begun to see is the damage to businesses of paying exorbitant compound interest.
He will be responsible for the apparel operations of the retailer's <ORGANIZATION>Holtzman's Little Folk Shop Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Richman Brothers Co.</ORGANIZATION> units and the <ORGANIZATION>Susie</ORGANIZATION>'s division of its <ORGANIZATION>Kinney Shoe Corp.</ORGANIZATION> unit.

The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration, urging the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> to give states more leeway to restrict abortions, said minors haven't any right to abortion without the consent of their parents. 
The administration urged the justices to adopt a legal standard suggested by Chief Justice <PERSON>William Rehnquist</PERSON> last July when the high court upheld <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>'s abortion restrictions.
On the provisions of the <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> law, the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration said that requiring that both parents be notified is a reasonable regulation, and that there is no need to have an alternative that allows minors to go to court for a judge's permission instead. 
The consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> takeover, and it's certainly true the rout began immediately after the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> trading halt.
Especially so since President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has been weakened by the <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> fiasco. 
To the extent that the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> troubles contributed to the plunge, they are another instance of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s sticky fingers.
But the airlines are scarcely a clear case, given anti-takeover mischief by Secretary of <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Skinner</ORGANIZATION>, who professes to believe safety will be compromised if <ORGANIZATION>KLM</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION> own interests in companies that fly airplanes. 
<PERSON>James Oberstar</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> Democrat who chairs the <ORGANIZATION>Public Works and Transportation Committee</ORGANIZATION>'s aviation subcommittee, has put an anti-airline takeover bill on supersonic speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the American and <ORGANIZATION>United Air Lines</ORGANIZATION> bids.
It would give <PERSON>Mr. Skinner</PERSON> up to 50 days to "review" any bid for 15% or more of the voting stock of any <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> carrier with revenues of $1 billion or more.
The <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s liaison with the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Board of Trade</ORGANIZATION> has improved; it will be interesting to learn if "circuit breakers" prove to be a good idea.
When <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> opened its doors to foreign investors in 1979, toy makers from <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> were among the first to march in. 
Today, with about 75% of the companies' products being made in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Hong Kong Toys Council</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Dennis Ting</PERSON>, has suggested a new sourcing label: "Made in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> by <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> Companies." 
But in the wake of the shootings in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> on June 4, the <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> toy industry is worrying about its strong dependence on <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>.
"Nobody wants to have all his eggs in one basket," says <PERSON>David Yeh</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>International Matchbox Group Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 
Indeed, <PERSON>Matchbox</PERSON> and other leading <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> toy makers were setting up factories in <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION>, especially in <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>, long before the massacre.
A supply of cheap labor and the access to <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s port, airport, banks and support industries, such as printing companies, have made <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Guangdong</LOCATION> province a premier manufacturing site. 
"<LOCATION>South China</LOCATION> is the most competitive source of toys in the world," says <PERSON>Henry Hu</PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION>Wah Shing Toys Consolidated Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 
Manufacturers say there is no immediate substitute for southern <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, where an estimated 120,000 people are employed by the toy industry. "For the next few years, like it or not, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is going to be the main supplier," says <PERSON>Edmund Young</PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Perfecta Enterprises Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, one of the first big <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> toy makers to move across the border. 
Several big companies have established manufacturing joint ventures in <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>, including <PERSON>Matchbox</PERSON>, <PERSON>Wah Shing</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Kader Industrial Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the toy manufacturer headed by <PERSON>Mr. Ting</PERSON>.
<LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> also are being studied. 
With the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> set to remove its internal trade barriers in 1992, several <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> companies are beginning to consider <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION> as possible manufacturing sites. 
Worries about <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> came just as <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s toy industry was recovering from a 1987 sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies, <ORGANIZATION>Worlds of Wonder Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Coleco Industries Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> manufacturers say large debt writeoffs and other financial problems resulting from the 1987 difficulties chastened the local industry, causing it to tighten credit policies and financial management.
Still, they long for a "mega-hit" toy to excite retail sales in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s biggest market for toys and games. 
The closest thing the colony's companies have to a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> mega-hit this year is the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series of action figures manufactured by <ORGANIZATION>Playmates Holdings Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. Introduced in mid-1988, the 15-centimeter-tall plastic turtles are based on an American comic book and television series. 
<PERSON>Paul Kwan</PERSON>, managing director of Playmates, says 10 million Ninja Turtles have been sold, placing the reptilian warriors among the 10 biggest-selling toys in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
Should sales continue to be strong through the Christmas season, which accounts for about 60% of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> retail toy sales, <PERSON>Mr. Kwan</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Ninja Turtles</ORGANIZATION> could make 1989 a record sales year for Playmates. 
Besides the lack of a fast-selling product, they cite the continued dominance of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market by <ORGANIZATION>Nintendo Entertainment System</ORGANIZATION>, an expensive video game made by <ORGANIZATION>Nintendo Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
Also, concern exists that the harder-line <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> leadership will tighten its control of <LOCATION>Guangdong</LOCATION>, which has been the main laboratory for the open-door policy and economic reforms. 
But, toy manufacturers and other industrialists say <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> will be restrained from tightening controls on export-oriented southern <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>.
They say <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s trade deficit is widening and the country is too short of foreign exchange for it to hamper production in <LOCATION>Guangdong</LOCATION>. "The Chinese leaders have to decide whether they want control or whether the want exports," says <PERSON>Mr. Kwan</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Playmates</LOCATION>. 
A four-page ad from <ORGANIZATION>Texas Instruments Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, running in approximately 140,000 issues of the Oct. 20 "Corporate Elite" issue of the <ORGANIZATION>McGraw-Hill Inc.</ORGANIZATION> publication, contains a speech synthesizer laminated between two of the pages.
The talking chip isn't cheap -- the per-ad cost to <ORGANIZATION>Texas Instruments</ORGANIZATION> is about $4, and that's without adding in Business Week's charge -- but <ORGANIZATION>Texas Instruments</ORGANIZATION> believes it is a first.
<ORGANIZATION>Hammond</ORGANIZATION> said that its discussions with <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity</ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, title-insurance underwriter, are continuing, but that prospects for a longer-term standstill agreement are uncertain. 
<ORGANIZATION>Fidelity</ORGANIZATION> has increased its stake in <LOCATION>Hammond</LOCATION> to 23.57% in recent months.
Statements made in <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> filings led <ORGANIZATION>Hammond</ORGANIZATION> to request a standstill agreement. 
The aircraft would replace the T-37, made by the <ORGANIZATION>Cessna Aircraft Co.</ORGANIZATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION>General Dynamics Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> uses to train jet pilots.
<ORGANIZATION>Lockheed</ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Navy</ORGANIZATION> may also buy an additional 340 trainer aircraft to replace its T34C trainers made by the <ORGANIZATION>Beech Aircraft Corp.</ORGANIZATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION>Raytheon Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
Under the agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Lockheed</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Aermacchi</ORGANIZATION> will license <ORGANIZATION>Lockheed</ORGANIZATION> to build the <ORGANIZATION>Aermacchi</ORGANIZATION> MB-339 jet tandem-trainer and will supply certain structures.
<ORGANIZATION>Lockheed</ORGANIZATION> will build additional structures and perform final assembly of the tandem-seat trainer at its <LOCATION>Marietta</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, plant should the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> order the craft. 
A <ORGANIZATION>Lockheed</ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION>Burbank</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, said he wasn't aware of which other companies would be competing for the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> contract.

<PERSON>Robert L. Corcoran Jr.</PERSON>, 45 years old, was named managing director and regional manager of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> at this firm's <ORGANIZATION>Chemical Bank</ORGANIZATION> unit.
The post was occupied on an interim basis by <PERSON>Marc Morrison</PERSON>, a managing director in the international-money-markets and government-securities department in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Corcoran</PERSON> most recently was head of administration and portfolio management at the <ORGANIZATION>Chemical Realty Group</ORGANIZATION> division of <ORGANIZATION>Chemical Bank</ORGANIZATION>. 
The tug of war between <ORGANIZATION>Warner Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION> over movie producers <PERSON>Peter Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jon Peters</PERSON> has exploded into a legal battle that could prove an embarrassing setback to <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>'s plans to enter the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> movie business. 
On Friday, after two weeks of fruitless settlement talks, <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> filed suit in <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Superior Court</ORGANIZATION> against <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Guber Peters Entertainment Co.</ORGANIZATION>, charging <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> with inducing the two producers to breach a five-year contract with <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peters</PERSON> from taking the top management posts at <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
As previously reported, <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> has agreed to pay $3.4 billion to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> and separately has agreed to pay $200 million for <ORGANIZATION>Guber Peters Entertainment</ORGANIZATION> to obtain the services of its two co-chief executives. 
<ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Guber Peters</PERSON> promptly countersued, charging <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> with attempting to interfere in <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of the two companies and with falsely asserting that the <PERSON>Guber Peters</PERSON> agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> prevents them from accepting the senior management posts at <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peters</PERSON> that requires the two to make movies exclusively for <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> for the next five years.
<PERSON>Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peters</PERSON> maintain that the contract doesn't prohibit taking an executive post at another studio.
<PERSON>Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peters</PERSON> from doing anything else in the motion picture business.
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> says in its suit that <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> "has unethically and illegally sought to steal the services of <PERSON>Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peters</PERSON> and injure <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> as a major competitor of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>." Moreover, <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> says, <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> enticed the producers with "unprecedented financial rewards to breach their binding contractual commitments to <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>." <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> also names in its suit the two producers, <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> Vice Chairman <PERSON>Michael Schulof</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Walter Yetnikoff</PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>CBS Records</ORGANIZATION> unit. 
<ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> responded in its countersuit by charging <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>, its chief executive <PERSON>Steven J. Ross</PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION>Warner Bros.</ORGANIZATION> unit chairman <PERSON>Robert Daly</PERSON> and President <PERSON>Terry Semel</PERSON> with embarking on an unlawful scheme to interfere with and disrupt <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>'s acquisitions.
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>, which is in the process of being acquired by <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, is attempting to "sabotage" <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>'s efforts as part of a "plan and scheme to dominate and control the entertainment business," the countersuit from <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Guber Peters</PERSON> adds. 
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> also appears to be trying to embarrass <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> by accusing the Japanese company's <LOCATION>U.S</LOCATION> executives, Messrs.
<PERSON>Schulof</PERSON> and <PERSON>Yetnikoff</PERSON>, of dishonorable dealings.
In its suit, <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> says that <PERSON>Mr. Ross</PERSON> warned <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Schulof</PERSON> on Sept. 26 at a dinner in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, "with <PERSON>Guber Peters</PERSON> in mind" that in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> "it is essential that corporations honor written contracts and do not induce breach of contracts by others." <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> went ahead the next day anyway and executed its own five-year agreement with the producers and agreed to buy their company, the suit adds.
Moreover, the suit adds that <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> initially said it wouldn't buy <PERSON>Guber Peters</PERSON> unless the <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> contract was settled.
On Tuesday, although a settlement wasn't reached, <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> publicly announced it would acquire <PERSON>Guber Peters</PERSON>. "<ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> has thus knowingly and willfully, and over <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>'s protests, induced <PERSON>Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peters</PERSON> to repudiate their contract with <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>," the suit says. 
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>'s decision to file suit in the wake of its failure to reach a settlement with <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> didn't surprise executives at rival studios, who say <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> is only protecting its own interests.
In <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>'s case, the studio obviously regards the relationship with <PERSON>Guber Peters</PERSON> as a crucial factor in <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>'s recent success and a central part of its future plans.
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> has relied heavily on the two to find and produce movies for the studio, including this summer's hit "Batman." <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> says in its suit that "<PERSON>Guber</PERSON> and Peters claim to have generated over one-half billion dollars in profits for <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> from combined projects," a claim <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> doesn't dispute.
<ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON>Guber Peters</PERSON> executives say in their countersuit, however, that the new contract eliminated language barring the two from serving "in any other capacity" in the motion picture business.
But entertainment industry executives say that the new contract was signed after <PERSON>Guber Peters</PERSON> efforts to take over <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION> failed and that <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> may argue in court that the producers' willingness to sign a new long-term contract signaled the end of their search for a movie studio. 
<PERSON>Mr. Ross</PERSON> and his team at <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> appear to view the move by the two producers to <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> as a personal betrayal after years of support and friendship. "<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> has been nurturing its relationship with <PERSON>Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peters</PERSON> since 1972, long before their recent success," the <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> suit says.
That success, the suit adds, "is due in large measure to the trust and confidence that <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> has reposed in these producers, even in the early years of the relationship when the creative partnership was not particularly profitable for <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>." 
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>, whose executives are the highest paid in the entertainment industry, also charges that <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> induced the two producers to breach their <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> contract by offering them "the most lucrative and expensive package of financial inducements in the film industry," including $2.7 million each in annual salary, deferred compensation of $50 million, as much as 10% of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s cash flow, and as much as 8% of the future appreciation of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s market value.
The producers also stand to get more than $50 million from their combined 28% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Guber Peters Entertainment</ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>'s $200 million offer for the company. 
<PERSON>Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peters</PERSON> say they seek $100 million in damages initially from <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> but may seek a higher amount later after determining the extent of damages. 
A second uranium-recovery plant at Uncle <PERSON>Sam</PERSON>, <LOCATION>La.</LOCATION>, that produces more than 700,000 pounds of uranium annually, will continue to operate. 
<ORGANIZATION>Freeport-McMoRan</ORGANIZATION> said the shutdown won't affect sales volumes under long-term sales contracts of its <ORGANIZATION>Freeport Uranium Recovery Co.</ORGANIZATION> unit, but will reduce the amount of product sold on the spot market.
And for six years, <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> have negotiated with <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION> studios in a futile attempt to change that. 
They hope the foreign deals will divide the <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> opposition and prod <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to push for ending federal rules that prohibit the networks from grabbing a piece of rerun sales and owning part of the shows they put on the air. 
That became clear last week with the disclosure that <ORGANIZATION>National Broadcasting Co.</ORGANIZATION>, backed by the deep pockets of parent <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION>, had tried to help fund <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Australia Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> 's now-scuttled $1.5 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION>MGM/UA Communications Co</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s interest may revive the deal, which MGM/UA killed last week when the Australian concern had trouble raising cash. 
Even if that deal isn't revived, <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> hopes to find another. "Our doors are open," an <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> spokesman says.
And any <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> effort could prompt <ORGANIZATION>CBS Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s parent, <ORGANIZATION>Capital Cities/ABC Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, to look for ways of skirting the fin-syn regulations. 
The networks still are "uninhibited in their authority" over what shows get on the air, charges <ORGANIZATION>Motion Picture Association</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Jack Valenti</PERSON>, the most vociferous opponent of rescinding the rules.
Studio executives in on the talks-including officials at <ORGANIZATION>Paramount Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Fries Entertainment Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Warner Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>MCA Inc.</ORGANIZATION> -- declined to be interviewed.
But recent developments have made the networks -- and <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Robert Wright</PERSON>, in particular -- ever more adamant that the networks must be unshackled to survive.
The latest provocation: <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's plan to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ORGANIZATION> for $3.4 billion, and to buy independent producer <ORGANIZATION>Guber Peters Entertainment Co.</ORGANIZATION> for $200 million. 
"I wonder what <PERSON>Walter Cronkite</PERSON> will think of the <ORGANIZATION>Sony/Columbia Broadcast System Trinitron Evening News</ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON>Dan Rather</PERSON> broadcast exclusively from <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>," wrote <PERSON>J.B. Holston</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> vice president, in a commentary in last week's issue of Broadcasting magazine.
In his article, <PERSON>Mr. Holston</PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> last week and unavailable, complained that the "archaic restraints" in fin-syn rules have "contributed directly to the acquisition of the studios by non-U.S. enterprises." (He didn't mention that <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>, in the meantime, was hoping to assist <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s Qintex in buying 
An <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> spokesman counters that <PERSON>Mr. Holston</PERSON>'s lament was "entirely consistent" with <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> plans because the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> rules would limit <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s involvement in the Qintex deal so severely as to be "light years away from the type of unrestrained deals available to <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> -- and everyone else except the three networks." 
The Big Three's drumbeat for deregulation began intensifying in the summer when the former <ORGANIZATION>Time Inc.</ORGANIZATION> went ahead with plans to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>.
Although Time already had a long-term contract to buy movies from <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>, the merger will let <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION>'s largely unregulated pay-cable channel, <ORGANIZATION>Home Box Office</ORGANIZATION>, own the <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> movies aired on <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION> -- a vertical integration that is effectively blocked by fin-syn regulations. 
<ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Wright</PERSON> led the way in decrying the networks' inability to match a <ORGANIZATION>Time-Warner</ORGANIZATION> combination.
He spoke up again when the <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> bid for <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> was announced.
Since <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s interest in the Qintex bid for MGM/UA was disclosed, <PERSON>Mr. Wright</PERSON> hasn't been available for comment.
With a Qintex deal, <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> would move into uncharted territory -- possibly raising hackles at the studios and in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. 
"It's never really been tested," says <PERSON>William Lilley III</PERSON>, who as a top <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> executive spent years lobbying to have the rules lifted.
He now runs <ORGANIZATION>Policy Communications</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, consulting to media companies.
But just eight days before the rules were to die, former President <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>, a one-time actor, intervened on behalf of <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>.
In <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, the issue falters: It's about money, not program quality, and <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> has lots of clout given its fund raising for senators and representatives overseeing the issue. 
A spokesman for Rep. <PERSON>Edward J. Markey</PERSON> (D-Mass.), who heads a subcommittee that oversees the <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION>, says <PERSON>Mr. Markey</PERSON> feels "the world has been forever changed by the <ORGANIZATION>Sony-Columbia</ORGANIZATION> deal." But he said <PERSON>Mr. Markey</PERSON> hopes this pushes the networks and studios to work it out on their own.
And at the <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, new Chairman <PERSON>Alfred C. Sikes</PERSON> has said he wants the two sides to hammer out their own plan. 
The first major event this morning in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stock and futures trading may be a pause at the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 
The aim of the interruption would be to ease the opening of the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, which would be hammered by such a volatile move on the <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION>. 
Most notably, several of the regulatory steps recommended by the <ORGANIZATION>Brady Task Force</ORGANIZATION>, which analyzed the 1987 crash, would be revived -- especially because that group's chairman is now the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> secretary.
<ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the <ORGANIZATION>Merc's Standard & Poor</ORGANIZATION>'s 500 contract, as well as "hot-line" communications among exchanges.
During the first halt, after the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> index had fallen 12 points, the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s "Sidecar" computer program automatically was triggered.
One <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> broker compared the action in the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> pit during the two freezes to a fire at a well-drilled school. "You don't want the fire but you know what to do," said <PERSON>Howard Dubnow</PERSON>, an independent floor broker and a <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> governor. "There was no panic.
The <ORGANIZATION>MMI</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 are the two major indexes used by program traders to run their computerized trading strategies.
There were also calls to strip the stock markets of "derivative" products, such as stock-index futures and options, which Federal <PERSON>Judge Stanley Sporkin</PERSON>, for example, likened to "barnacles attached to the basic market." And there was much criticism of the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>'s system of having stock trades flow through specialists, or market makers. 
The <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> White House held the Brady recommendations at arm's length and named a second panel -- the <ORGANIZATION>Working Group on the Financial Markets</ORGANIZATION> -- to review its analysis and those of other crash studies.
In May 1988, the Working Group, made up of representatives from the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION>Commodity Futures Trading Commission</ORGANIZATION>, finally endorsed only circuit breakers. 
-- If <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> futures fall 12 points (equivalent to about 100 points on <ORGANIZATION>DJIA</ORGANIZATION>), trading is frozen for half hour to that price or higher.
-- If <ORGANIZATION>Dow Industrials</ORGANIZATION> fall 250 points, trading on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> halts for an hour.
<ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>MMI</ORGANIZATION> contracts also halt. 
-- If <ORGANIZATION>DJIA</ORGANIZATION> drops 400 points, <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> halts trading for two hours.
Trading in <ORGANIZATION>MMI</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> futures also halted. 
-- Transfer jurisdiction over stock-related futures to <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION>CFTC</ORGANIZATION>. (Opposed by new <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> chairman) -- Give <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> authority to halt securities trading, (also opposed by new <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> chairman). 
"There must not be a monopoly, there must be freedom of choice for both journalists and viewers," <PERSON>Nikolai I. Lutsenko</PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION>Nika TV</ORGANIZATION> company, told the weekly newspaper <ORGANIZATION>Nedelya</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Lutsenko</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>Nedelya</ORGANIZATION> that he recently had been to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> to pick up the rights to show 5,000 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> films in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Nedelya</LOCATION>'s article was accompanied by a picture of <PERSON>Mr. Lutsenko</PERSON> interviewing singer <PERSON>John Denver</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Union of Mineworkers</ORGANIZATION> said that about 10,000 diamond miners struck for higher wages at <ORGANIZATION>De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. De Beers said that workers at five of the group's mines were on strike, which it said was peaceful, with orderly picketing occurring at one of the mines.
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s opposition <ORGANIZATION>Socialist Party</ORGANIZATION> denied that its legislators had been bribed by pinball-parlor owners.
<PERSON>Tsuruo Yamaguchi</PERSON>, secretary general of the <ORGANIZATION>Socialist Party</ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged that nine party lawmakers had received donations from the pachinko association totaling 8 million yen (about $55,000) but said the donations were legal and none of its members acted to favor the industry. 
The World Wide Fund for Nature said that <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> were doing too little to prevent illegal trade in endangered wildlife across their borders.
A report by the conservation group presented at the U.N.-sponsored Convention on <ORGANIZATION>International Trade</ORGANIZATION> in Endangered Species in <LOCATION>Lausanne</LOCATION> accused the four of trading protected species ranging from parakeets to orchids.
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> announced technical reasons for withdrawing, but some officials pointed to growing reluctance among the allies to commit themselves to big defense spending while East-West disarmament talks show signs of success. 
Small wonder that <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Labor Party</ORGANIZATION> wants credit controls.
As with other plastic in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s high-interest-rate environment, the Labor card, administered by <ORGANIZATION>Co-operative Bank</ORGANIZATION>, carries a stiff (in this case, 29.8%) annual rate on the unpaid balance. 
In a sign of growing official tolerance for religion, <LOCATION>Russian Orthodox</LOCATION> priests were allowed to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> patriarchate in the <LOCATION>Kremlin</LOCATION>'s 15th-century Uspensky Cathedral, where czars were crowned. . . . A 34-foot-tall, $7.7 million statue of <LOCATION>Buddha</LOCATION> was completed on a hill outside <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>, facing <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>.
The statue is the brainchild of <PERSON>Sik Chi Wan</PERSON>, director of the <PERSON>Po Lin Monastery</PERSON>, who said: "<LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> is such a prosperous place, we also need some kind of religious symbol." 
<ORGANIZATION>Lomas Financial Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, said it will ask a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> bankruptcy court to allow it to hire <ORGANIZATION>Lazard Freres & Co.</ORGANIZATION> to help it sell its leasing unit. 
<LOCATION>Lomas</LOCATION>, assisted by <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ORGANIZATION>, has been trying to sell its <ORGANIZATION>Equitable Lomas Leasing Co.</ORGANIZATION> for several months, apparently without success. 
<ORGANIZATION>Lomas</ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION>, which owns bonds and equity in <LOCATION>Lomas</LOCATION>, couldn't continue as <PERSON>Lomas</PERSON>'s investment banker because it is also a creditor.
It said it chose <PERSON>Lazard</PERSON> in part because of <PERSON>Lazard</PERSON>'s offices in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, where investors might be interested in a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> leasing company. 
The lower net included a charge of $35 million, equal to 12 cents a share on an after-tax basis, for the cost of abandoning a computer-systems joint venture with <ORGANIZATION>Siemens AG</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>.
On Friday, <PERSON>Andrew S.Grove</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION> president and chief executive officer, said "<ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION>'s business is strong.
I was profoundly moved by the incongruity of modern <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> life illustrated by your Sept. 20 page-one article "Country Doctor: How a Physician Solved <PERSON>Riddle</PERSON> of Rare Disease in Children of <LOCATION>Amish</LOCATION>." 
<PERSON>Dr. Morton</PERSON>'s success is not only a measure of the outstanding quality of his work, but also of the desperation the <LOCATION>Amish</LOCATION> must feel in the face of this horrendous disease. 
<ORGANIZATION>Dresdner Bank AG</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> has announced a friendly tender offer for control of <ORGANIZATION>Banque Internationale de Placements</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> bank whose main shareholder is <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Societe Generale</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Societe de Bourses Francaises</ORGANIZATION> said. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Societe Generale</ORGANIZATION> banking group controls 18.2% of the shareholding, while <ORGANIZATION>Societe Generale de Belgique S.A.</ORGANIZATION> owns 9.69% and <ORGANIZATION>Financiere Tradition</ORGANIZATION>, a holding company, owns 5.1%. 
GREAT <ORGANIZATION>AMERICAN COMMUNICATIONS Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION>, said it exchanged about $50 million in debentures and notes for 3.65 million of its common shares at $12 a share.
As a result of the transaction, <ORGANIZATION>American Financial Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's common holdings in <LOCATION>Great American</LOCATION> declined to 64% from 71%.
<ORGANIZATION>Federal Industries</ORGANIZATION>, a diversified manufacturing, distribution and transportation concern based in <LOCATION>Winnipeg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Manitoba</LOCATION>, said the debentures will be convertible until their 1999 maturity into the company's Class A shares at C$18.50 a share.
<ORGANIZATION>Federal Industries</ORGANIZATION> said C$54 million of the proceeds will be used to finance its previously reported plan to buy <ORGANIZATION>W.H. Smith Canada Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a bookstore chain, and the balance to repay short-term debt. 
<ORGANIZATION>REPLIGEN Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it will issue one million new common shares in a $9 million private placement to institutional investors in the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION>
The <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, biotechnology company said proceeds will be used to broaden its research and development of products to fight infectious diseases and to increase manufacturing capabilities.
<ORGANIZATION>Bear Stearns & Co.</ORGANIZATION> handled the closing of the transactions, <PERSON>Repligen</PERSON> said.
The firm, which was acquired in April from <LOCATION>Sears</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Roebuck & Co.</ORGANIZATION> in a management-led buy-out, had planned to sell up to $56.4 million of stock, or a 50% stake in the company, to its 5,000 employees. 
Though the offering didn't sell out, <PERSON>James J. Didion</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We're pretty proud of the employees' response." He noted that unlike an employee stock ownership plan, where a company usually borrows money from third party lenders to buy stock that it sets aside to award employees over time, here employees had to fork out their own cash for the stock. "They came up with their own money instead of borrowed money," <PERSON>Mr. Didion</PERSON> said. "It's totally different."

The inflation-adjusted growth rate for <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s gross domestic product for the second quarter was revised upward to 0.8% from the previous three months from the initial estimate of 0.7%, the <ORGANIZATION>National Statistics Institute</ORGANIZATION> said. 
What better place to turn than <PERSON>Sen. Edward Kennedy</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Labor Committee</ORGANIZATION>, that great stove of government expansionism, where many a stagnant pot of porridge is kept on the back burner until it can be brought forward and presented as nouvelle cuisine? 
In this case, the new recipe for national service called for throwing many assorted legislative leftovers into one kettle: a demonstration project for educational aid (particularly satisfying to the <ORGANIZATION>DLC</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Sen. Sam Nunn</PERSON>), a similar demonstration program for youth conservation (a la Sen. Chris Dodd), a competitive grants program to states to spark youth and senior citizen volunteer projects (a Kennedy specialty), a community service work-study program for students (pleasing to the palate of <PERSON>Sen. Dale Bumpers</PERSON>, among others), plus engorgement of the <ORGANIZATION>VISTA</ORGANIZATION> volunteer program and the Retired Senior Volunteer, <PERSON>Foster Grandparent</PERSON>, and Senior Companion programs.

<ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Alan Greenspan</PERSON> was on the telephones, making it clear to officials in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and abroad that the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system, as it did in October 1987, if the action were needed to prevent a financial crisis. 
And at the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>, Secretary <PERSON>Nicholas Brady</PERSON> talked with friends and associates on Wall Street while Assistant Secretary <PERSON>David Mullins</PERSON> carefully analyzed data on the Friday market plunge. 
In addition, officials at the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> and in the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration decided that avoiding overt actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should Friday's market drop turn into this morning's rout. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>'s efforts at secrecy were partly foiled Sunday morning, when both the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> carried stories quoting a senior <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> official saying the central bank was prepared to pour cash into the banking system Monday morning.
<ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Greenspan</PERSON> was surprised by both stories, according to knowledgeable sources, and insisted he hadn't authorized any public comment.
The reticence of federal officials was evident in the appearance Sunday of Budget Director <PERSON>Richard Darman</PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s "This Week." "Secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury Brady</ORGANIZATION> and Chairman <PERSON>Greenspan</PERSON> and the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> and others have been in close contact.
At the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>, Secretary <PERSON>Brady</PERSON> issued a statement minimizing the stock market's drop. "Today's stock market decline doesn't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy," he said. "The economy remains well-balanced, and the outlook is for continued moderate growth." 
Nevertheless, <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Greenspan</PERSON> and Vice Chairman <PERSON>Manuel Johnson</PERSON> were in their offices Sunday evening, monitoring events as they unfolded in markets around the world.
The action was expected to begin with the opening of the <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> foreign exchange markets at 5 p.m. EST -- when stocks there plunged -- and to continue as the trading day began later in the evening in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> and through early this morning in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
Both the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> planned to keep market rooms operating throughout the night to monitor the developments.
In the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration, the lead is being taken by <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Brady</PERSON>, Undersecretary <PERSON>Robert Glauber</PERSON> and Assistant Secretary <PERSON>Mullins</PERSON>.
The three men worked together on the so-called <ORGANIZATION>Brady Commission</ORGANIZATION>, headed by <PERSON>Mr. Brady</PERSON>, which was established after the 1987 crash to examine the market's collapse.
He was quickly on the phone with <PERSON>Mr. Mullins</PERSON>, who in turn was talking with the chairmen of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> exchanges.
Later, <PERSON>Mr. Brady</PERSON> phoned <PERSON>Mr. Greenspan</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Richard Breeden</PERSON> and numerous contacts in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and overseas.
He had frequent telephone consultations with <PERSON>Mr. Brady</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michael Boskin</PERSON>, chairman of the counsel of economic advisers. 
<ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON>David Mulford</PERSON>, for instance, was at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>Business Council</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Hot Springs</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, when the stock market fell, and remained there through the following day.
And as of last night, <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Greenspan</PERSON> hadn't canceled his plans to address the <ORGANIZATION>American Bankers Association</ORGANIZATION> convention in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> at 10 a.m. this morning. 
Ironically, <PERSON>Mr. Greenspan</PERSON> was scheduled to address the same convention in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> on Oct. 20, 1987.
He flew to <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> on Oct. 19, when the market plummeted 508 points, but then turned around the next morning and returned to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> without delivering his speech. 
<PERSON>Roy S. MacDowell Jr.</PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION>MacDowell Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a construction and site-development concern, was named a director of this bank holding company, expanding the board to seven members. 
In April, <LOCATION>Mr. Paris</LOCATION> joined <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, where he was a vice president.
<ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION> is about 80%-owned by <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Fairfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, which also owns <ORGANIZATION>GE Capital</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales arm has named <PERSON>Gary Anderson</PERSON> its top <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official in the wake of a series of resignations last month. 
<PERSON>Mr. Anderson</PERSON>, who joined <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in June 1987, gets the title of marketing director for the company's automotive division.
Some of these duties had been handled by <PERSON>Mr. Mazza</PERSON> and others by <PERSON>John Dorsey</PERSON>, former director of sales, and <PERSON>Larry Messelt</PERSON>, former national sales manager.
<PERSON>Dorsey</PERSON> and <PERSON>Messelt</PERSON> were the other two executives who resigned in September. 
Suzuki sales so far this year, at 24,405 cars and sport utility vehicles, are less than half the level of a year ago, despite the introduction of two additional vehicles, including <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON>'s first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> car.
<PERSON>Mr. Anderson</PERSON> was most recently <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> regional sales manager.
<PERSON>Roger Rosenblatt</PERSON>, editor of <ORGANIZATION>U.S. News & World Report</ORGANIZATION>, resigned Friday from the weekly news magazine. 
<PERSON>Mr. Rosenblatt</PERSON> said he resigned because of difficulties with commuting between his home in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and the magazine's editorial offices in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. "Frankly, I missed my family," said <PERSON>Mr. Rosenblatt</PERSON>. 
But at 2.3 million weekly paid circulation, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> News still ranks third behind <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Time magazine</ORGANIZATION>, with 4.4 million circulation, and <ORGANIZATION>Washington Post Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION>, with 3.3 million circulation. 
<PERSON>Mortimer B. Zuckerman</PERSON>, chairman and editor in chief, said <PERSON>Mr. Rosenblatt</PERSON> would be succeeded starting today by <PERSON>Michael Ruby</PERSON>, the magazine's executive editor, and <PERSON>Merrill McLoughlin</PERSON>, a senior writer.
<PERSON>Mr. Ruby</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ms. McLoughlin</PERSON> are married to each other.
<PERSON>Mr. Rosenblatt</PERSON>, a senior writer at <ORGANIZATION>Time magazine</ORGANIZATION> before joining <ORGANIZATION>U.S. News & World Report</ORGANIZATION>, said he had numerous job offers from other magazines while he was editor.
However, the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> also claims that its mostly aluminum Aegis-class cruisers, some of which are yet to be built, could never meet the fate of the <LOCATION>Sheffield</LOCATION> because no enemy missile could penetrate their defenses. 
<LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala</LOCATION>. 
The ruling stems from a 1984 suit filed by shareholders of <ORGANIZATION>Apple Computer Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, claiming that company officials misled investors about the expected success of the <LOCATION>Lisa</LOCATION> computer, introduced in 1983. 
According to the suit, <ORGANIZATION>Apple</ORGANIZATION> officials created public excitement by touting <PERSON>Lisa</PERSON> as an office computer that would revolutionize the workplace and be extremely successful in its first year.
In 1987, the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> district court dismissed the case largely because newspaper reports had sufficiently counterbalanced the company's statements by alerting consumers to <PERSON>Lisa</PERSON>'s problems. 
However, it gave the shareholders the right to pursue a small portion of their claim that pertains to <PERSON>Lisa</PERSON>'s disk drive, known as <ORGANIZATION>Twiggy</ORGANIZATION>.
"The court was careful to say that the adverse information appeared in the very same articles and received the same attention as the company's statements," said <PERSON>Patrick Grannon</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> lawyer at the firm of <ORGANIZATION>Greenfield & Chimicles</ORGANIZATION>, which wasn't involved in the case. "The court is saying that the adverse facts have to be transferred to the market with equal intensity and credibility as the statements of corporate insiders." 
Shareholders' attorneys at the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> firm of <LOCATION>Milberg</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Weiss</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Bershad</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Specthrie & Lerach</ORGANIZATION> last week petitioned for a rehearing of the case.
The <ORGANIZATION>National Football League</ORGANIZATION> is considering appealing the ruling stemming from the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Football League</ORGANIZATION>'s largely unsuccessful antitrust suit against the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>. 
A jury in 1986 agreed with the <ORGANIZATION>USFL</ORGANIZATION>'s claims that the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> monopolized major league football.
Last week, the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> upheld a $5.5 million award of attorneys fees to the defunct league.
<PERSON>Harvey D. Myerson</PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION>Myerson & Kuhn</ORGANIZATION>, then of <LOCATION>Finley</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Kumble</PERSON>, <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON>, <PERSON>Heine</PERSON>, <PERSON>Underberg</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Manley</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Myerson & Casey</ORGANIZATION>, was the lead trial lawyer, and his new firm pursued the application appeal.
<PERSON>Douglas R. Pappas</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Myerson & Kuhn</ORGANIZATION> says about $5.3 million of the award goes directly to the <ORGANIZATION>USFL</ORGANIZATION> to reimburse it for fees already paid.
But <PERSON>Shepard Goldfein</PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>, says his client will consider asking for another hearing or appealing to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Goldfein</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Skadden</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Arps</ORGANIZATION>, Slate, <ORGANIZATION>Meagher & Flom</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, says the ruling is wrong and the fee award is excessive because the <ORGANIZATION>USFL</ORGANIZATION> lost its major claims, including its contention that the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> restrained trade through television contracts. 
"The <ORGANIZATION>USFL</ORGANIZATION> was not the prevailing party," <PERSON>Mr. Goldfein</PERSON> insists. 
HOUSTON-CALGARY ALLIANCE: <ORGANIZATION>Fulbright & Jaworski</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Fenerty</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Fraser & Hatch of Calgary</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION>, are affiliating to help serve their energy-industry clients.
But they will work together on energy-, environmental- and fair-trade-related issues and conduct seminars on topics of mutual interest, said <PERSON>Gibson Gayle Jr.</PERSON> of 585-lawyer <ORGANIZATION>Fulbright & Jaworski</ORGANIZATION>.
In addition, <ORGANIZATION>Fulbright & Jaworski</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, office will play a key role as the firms work together on regulatory issues, particularly natural-gas exports, for their clients.
The arrangement, reached after about eight months of negotiations, grew out of 80-lawyer <PERSON>Fenerty Robertson</PERSON>'s desire to develop ties with a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> firm in light of relaxed trade barriers between the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Francis M. Saville</PERSON> of <PERSON>Fenerty Robertson</PERSON>. 
IN WHAT MAY SIGNAL a turnaround for asbestos manufacturers, <ORGANIZATION>W.R. Grace & Co.</ORGANIZATION> won a 3 1/2-week trial in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> over whether it should be required to remove asbestos fireproofing from a local high school.
<LOCATION>Mount Lebanon High School</LOCATION>, near <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>, sought $21 million in compensatory damages from Grace, arguing that the asbestos, which can cause respiratory diseases and lung cancer, posed a risk to students.
FCC COUNSEL JOINS FIRM: <PERSON>Diane S. Killory</PERSON> will join 500-lawyer <ORGANIZATION>Morrison & Foerster</ORGANIZATION> as a partner in its <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, office in mid-November.
<PERSON>Ms. Killory</PERSON>, 35 years old, resigned as <ORGANIZATION>Federal Communications Commission</ORGANIZATION> general counsel early this month after nearly three years in that post.
RICHARD P. <LOCATION>MAGURNO</LOCATION>, formerly <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION>' top lawyer, joined the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION>Lord Day & Lord</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Barrett Smith</PERSON> as a partner.
<PERSON>Mr. Magurno</PERSON>, 45, spent 17 years at the <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> airline unit of Houston-based <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and was named general counsel in 1984.
<PERSON>Mr. Magurno</PERSON> said he will split his time between the 200-lawyer firm's offices in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, with specialties in aviation and labor law. 
The Naval <ORGANIZATION>ROTC</ORGANIZATION> program at <LOCATION>Villanova</LOCATION> never held meetings at fraternity houses as we have no fraternity houses.
<ORGANIZATION>Villanova University</ORGANIZATION> and the surrounding community have supported the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> 100% every year since World War II and the university is recognized as unequaled in providing the best of support to the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>.
All that occurred during the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> era was an occasional sign-carrying student near the parade ground in peaceful protest, but no effort was made to disrupt the Naval <ORGANIZATION>ROTC</ORGANIZATION> activities. 
<PERSON>Villanova</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Navy</ORGANIZATION> are very proud of their superb relationship over the past 50 years. 
"You've got a two-tiered market," said <PERSON>Frank W. Anderson</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Stephens Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Little Rock</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ark</LOCATION>.
On top, he said, are such dynamos as <ORGANIZATION>NCNB Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>First City Bancorp</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, which acquired big, ailing <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> banks in government-assisted transactions that allowed them to slough off bad loans.
As for the rest, warns <PERSON>James McDermott</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Keefe Bruyette & Woods</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, "asset quality concerns are going to dominate third-quarter reports." 
For example, <ORGANIZATION>Cullen/Frost Bankers Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, is expecting "an uptick in {non-performing loans} related to real estate" in the third quarter, said <PERSON>Thomas Frost</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive.
As the only major bank holding company in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> to survive without a bailout or merger, Cullen/Frost managed only "very modest" earnings in the period, he said. "If the government handed me a big bucket of money I'd look good, too," <PERSON>Mr. Frost</PERSON> added. 
<ORGANIZATION>NCNB Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> operation, on the other hand, is expected to report an operating profit "in line with {or} perhaps a bit better" than its results in the first two quarters, <PERSON>Timothy Hartman</PERSON>, vice chairman of the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> unit, said.
<ORGANIZATION>NCNB</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, bought the banking assets of failed <ORGANIZATION>First Republic Bank Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> last year in a transaction expected to cost the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</ORGANIZATION> about $3 billion. (<ORGANIZATION>First Republic</ORGANIZATION> isn't related to <ORGANIZATION>First Republic Bancorp</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.) <PERSON>Robert Rieke</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Raucher Pierce Refsnes Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, estimates Houston-based <ORGANIZATION>First City</ORGANIZATION>'s third-quarter net was higher than second quarter earnings of $28.1 million.
<ORGANIZATION>First City</ORGANIZATION> was recapitalized last year by a group led by <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> banker <PERSON>A. Robert Abboud</PERSON>.
These include the sale of <ORGANIZATION>MCorp</ORGANIZATION>'s failed banks to <ORGANIZATION>Banc One Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>; the sale of <ORGANIZATION>National Bancshares Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Equimark Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>; and the sale of <ORGANIZATION>Texas American Bancshares Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's banking assets to <ORGANIZATION>Deposit Guaranty Bank of Dallas</ORGANIZATION>.
<LOCATION>Outside Texas</LOCATION>, the biggest real estate nightmare for banks in the region is probably <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>. "<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> is going to be a mess," said <PERSON>Keefe Bruyette</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Mr. McDermott</PERSON>. 
Several banks with operations in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, including <ORGANIZATION>First Interstate Bancorp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Security Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, both of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, have already indicated they see asset-quality problems.
<ORGANIZATION>Chase Manhattan Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, last month took a $126 million charge against earnings related to real estate loans at <ORGANIZATION>Chase Bank of Arizona</ORGANIZATION>. 
Several credit rating agencies recently downgraded the senior debt of <ORGANIZATION>Valley National Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, warning that the Phoenix-based bank holding company is vulnerable to the deteriorating real estate market. "Despite the special addition to reserves in the second quarter, <LOCATION>Valley</LOCATION> remains poorly reserved against its real estate exposure," <ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said in July. 
More good news comes from <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, where banks didn't have as much opportunity to get into difficulty in the first place. "The state never grew fast enough to get banking organizations in real trouble and the banking organizations were never big enough to lend into trouble," said <PERSON>Mr. Rieke</PERSON> of <PERSON>Raucher Pierce Refsnes</PERSON>. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> OFFICIALS MOVED to head off any repeat of <LOCATION>Black</LOCATION> Monday today following Friday's plunge in stock prices.
<ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Greenspan</PERSON> signaled that the central bank was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system to prevent a financial crisis.
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> won't press for a capital-gains provision in the final deficit bill when <ORGANIZATION>House-Senate</ORGANIZATION> conferees meet later this week. 
<ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> signaled that up to five <LOCATION>North American</LOCATION> assembly plants may close by the mid-1990s as it tries to cut excess capacity. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> car and truck sales fell 12.6% in early October, the first sales period of the 1990-model year, dragged down by a sharp decline in <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> sales. 
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> are entangled in a legal battle over movie producers <PERSON>Peter Gruber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jon Peters</PERSON>.
The fight could set back <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>'s plans to enter the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> movie business. 
<ORGANIZATION>Hooker</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unit received a $409 million bid for most of its real-estate and shopping-center assets from an investor group.
The offer doesn't include <ORGANIZATION>Bonwit Teller</ORGANIZATION> or <PERSON>B. Altman</PERSON>. 
<LOCATION>America West</LOCATION> said Friday it will postpone its new service out of <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> because of delays in receiving aircraft from <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION>. 
There's an intense debate in <LOCATION>South Korean</LOCATION> President <PERSON>Roh Tae Woo</PERSON>'s inner circle over his scheduled speech Wednesday to a joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>: Should he give it in English or Korean? 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> politicians and policy-makers would do well to remember such backhome pressures on the <LOCATION>South Korean</LOCATION> president as they prepare for an important series of meetings with him this week.
Moreover, the <LOCATION>Korean</LOCATION> peninsula remains one of the strategic focal points of <LOCATION>East Asia</LOCATION>; there are 43,000 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops stationed there.
<LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> is "critically important to us now, both economically and in terms of security," says <PERSON>Sen. Richard Lugar</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION>), the former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Foreign Relations Committee</ORGANIZATION>. "Unfortunately, many Americans don't think much about <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>.
But the miracle of their economic growth and the development of democracy -- imperfect though it is -- are very important to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>." One major topic during <PERSON>Mr. Roh</PERSON>'s visit will be human rights.
Due process still is denied in <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>; a few months ago, <PERSON>Kim Dae Jung</PERSON>, the major opposition leader, was detained and interrogated for 20 hours by security thugs.
Just as <PERSON>Pope John Paul II</PERSON> did in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> last week, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> ought to tell <PERSON>Mr. Roh</PERSON> in no uncertain terms that this kind of behavior is unacceptable. 
Moreover, there is a violent anti-U.S. minority in <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> -- as demonstrated by the handful of radical students who broke into <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Ambassador <PERSON>Donald Gregg</PERSON>'s residence in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> Friday and vandalized it (the ambassador and his wife were unharmed). 
One thing that hasn't changed in <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> is paranoia about <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION>; several people are being prosecuted for making unapproved visits to the communist north.
Sometimes <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> politicians forget that <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION>, a country with a population of only 20 million, has an armed force of over one million troops, the sixth largest in the world. 
As long as it continues to pose a real threat, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> critics ought to go slow on demands to reduce troop levels in <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> hardly is without fault for trade frictions with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>; most experts in the administration think that <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Robert Mosbacher</PERSON> got it exactly wrong a few months ago when he declared that <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> is more open economically than <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
It's appropriate for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials to keep hammering for more open trade policies, as <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON>Carla Hills</PERSON> did in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> last week.
But there's also sometimes a tendency in <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> political circles to pick especially on <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>, out of frustration over our inability to do much about <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
Most importantly, it's time for <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> policy-makers to better appreciate that our economic future rests more with <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> -- <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> -- than anyplace else. 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> always ought to stand up for its interests, but it's essential that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials have an appreciation of the politics and history of our allies.
In the upper echelons of the <PERSON>Roh Tae Woo</PERSON>'s government, they're still buzzing about <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Mosbacher</PERSON>'s trip to <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> earlier this year.
It seems he learned, for the first time, that <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> had been occupied for decades by <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
The trade gap is expected to widen to about $9 billion from July's $7.6 billion, according to a survey by <ORGANIZATION>MMS International</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>McGraw-Hill Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
"There's a possibility of a surprise" in the trade report, said <PERSON>Michael Englund</PERSON>, director of research at <ORGANIZATION>MMS</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Robert H. Chandross</PERSON>, an economist for <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, is among those expecting a more moderate gain in the CPI than in prices at the producer level. "Auto prices had a big effect in the <ORGANIZATION>PPI</ORGANIZATION>, and at the CPI level they won't," he said. 
Food prices are expected to be unchanged, but energy costs jumped as much as 4%, said <PERSON>Gary Ciminero</PERSON>, economist at <ORGANIZATION>Fleet/Norstar Financial Group</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Yankelovich</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Clancy</PERSON>, <PERSON>Shulman</PERSON>, a market research firm in <LOCATION>Westport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, warns clients that Americans' love affair with shopping is on the rocks: More than half the women it has surveyed in recent years, and an even larger percentage of men, say shopping for clothes is a hassle. 
Shopping has become "just one of the activities that we have to do," says <PERSON>Susan Hayward</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Yankelovich</ORGANIZATION>. "It's not an end in itself anymore." 
But when they go to a store today, they're more likely to think of the trip as a mission rather than an adventure. "They're buyers as opposed to shoppers," says <PERSON>Thomas Rauh</PERSON>, a retail consultant at the accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION>Ernst & Young</ORGANIZATION>. 
Consumers visit fewer stores per trip (an average of three last year, down from 3.6 in 1982, according to consultant <ORGANIZATION>Stillerman Jones & Co.</ORGANIZATION>) and spend less time in malls (an average of 68 minutes per trip last year, down from 90 minutes in 1982). "I leave rather than hunt for something," snaps <PERSON>Lisa Max</PERSON>, a 46-year-old real estate broker in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
Despite such negative attitudes, retailers generally say consumers aren't cutting back on what they buy. "If it is dropping off, it would be more likely that they're shopping less often and buying more when they do shop," says <PERSON>Michael Wellman</PERSON>, vice president of marketing at <ORGANIZATION>K mart Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
"There's no question our customers' time has become more valuable than ever," says <PERSON>Stephen Watson</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Dayton Hudson Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's department store unit.
Take <PERSON>Cyd Hinman</PERSON>, a mother of two from <LOCATION>Norwood</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>.
Twice, <PERSON>Mrs. Hinman</PERSON> picked merchandise off <PERSON>Filene</PERSON>'s racks labeled with "sale" signs, only to be told when she got to the cash register that the goods weren't on special.
Service has declined just at a time when consumers are more impatient than ever. "The whole tone of voice is different now in terms of what people expect from a store," says <PERSON>William Ress</PERSON>, whose <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, management consulting firm has surveyed consumers for more than 20 years. 
So what should a retailer do? "Those that do the best job of making the shopping experience enjoyable and making the customer feel like a human being are very well rewarded," says <PERSON>Leo J. Shapiro</PERSON>, a market researcher in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. 
Last month, <ORGANIZATION>R.H. Macy & Co.</ORGANIZATION> started promising in ads that shoppers in search of women's coats could "cut through all the confusing sales, special buys and clearances out there" and pay what <PERSON>Macy</PERSON>'s says is the "lowest prices . . . every day." 
When a store keeps dropping prices, the <LOCATION>Farmington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, resident says, "I get suspicious that they're trying to get the most they can out of you." 
<PERSON>Antonio L. Savoca</PERSON>, 66 years old, was named president and chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION>Atlantic Research Corp.</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary.
<PERSON>Mr. Savoca</PERSON> succeeds <PERSON>William H. Borten</PERSON>, who resigned to pursue personal interests.
It wasn't so long ago that a radio network funded by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> -- and originally by the <ORGANIZATION>Central Intelligence Agency</ORGANIZATION> -- was accused by officials here of employing propagandists, imperialists and spies.
"I think this is a victory for the radio," says <PERSON>Barnabas de Bueky</PERSON>, a 55-year-old former <LOCATION>Hungarian</LOCATION> refugee who works in the <LOCATION>Munich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, headquarters as deputy director of the Hungarian service.
In fact, the network hopes to set up offices in <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION> and anywhere else in the <LOCATION>East Bloc</LOCATION> that will have it. 
"They have a lot to do these days to compete with Hungarian radio," says <PERSON>Andrew Deak</PERSON>, a computer-science student at the <ORGANIZATION>Technical University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Budapest</LOCATION>. "The Hungarian {radio} reporters seem better informed and more critical about about what's going on here." 
The <ORGANIZATION>British Broadcasting Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. State Department</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Voice of America</ORGANIZATION> broadcast over Hungarian airwaves, though only a few hours a day each in <LOCATION>Hungarian</LOCATION>.
Australian press magnate <PERSON>Rupert Murdoch</PERSON> has bought 50% stakes in two popular and gossipy Hungarian newspapers, while <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Robert Maxwell</PERSON> has let it be known here that he is thinking about similar moves. 
With its mission for free speech and the capitalist way, the network's staff says it still has plenty to do -- in <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> and in the "Great Eastern Beyond." <ORGANIZATION>Radio Free Europe</ORGANIZATION> and its sister station for the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Radio Liberty</ORGANIZATION>, say they won't cut back their more than 19 hours of daily broadcasts.
They are still an important source of news for 60 million listeners in 23 exotic tongues: from Bulgarian and <LOCATION>Belorussian</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Kazakh</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kirghiz</LOCATION>. 
The establishment of its first bureau in <ORGANIZATION>Warsaw Pact</ORGANIZATION> territory shows the depth of some of the changes in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>.
Not only did the <ORGANIZATION>Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs</ORGANIZATION> approve <ORGANIZATION>Radio Free Europe</ORGANIZATION>'s new location, but the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Telecommunications</ORGANIZATION> did something even more amazing: "They found us four phone lines in central <LOCATION>Budapest</LOCATION>," says <PERSON>Geza Szocs</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Radio Free Europe</ORGANIZATION> correspondent who helped organize the <LOCATION>Budapest</LOCATION> location. "That is a miracle." 
Through much of the post-World War II period, listening to Western broadcasts was a crime in <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>. "When we listen to the <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> station, my mother still gets nervous," says a <LOCATION>Budapest</LOCATION> translator. "She wants to turn down the volume and close the curtains." 
The Budapest office plans to hire free-lance reporters to cover the latest happenings in <LOCATION>Hungarian</LOCATION> country towns from <LOCATION>Nagykanizsa</LOCATION> in the west to <LOCATION>Nyiregyhaza</LOCATION> in the east.
My youth in <LOCATION>Petrograd</LOCATION>, my father -- whom I never saw again after 1924, when I left <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> for the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> -- the whole of my early life, it's all been brought back to me by the arrival, out of a clear blue sky, of this exhibition.
The years between <LOCATION>Petrograd</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> are the dream.
The reality to which <PERSON>Ms. Geva</PERSON> refers is the hoard of dance memorabilia currently on view at <ORGANIZATION>Eduard Nakhamkin Fine Arts</ORGANIZATION> here, under the title, "100 Years of Russian Ballet: 1830-1930." Consisting of roughly 400 items from the Leningrad State Museum of Theater and Music, the show offers tantalizing glimpses of a rich artistic achievement. 
For <PERSON>Ms. Geva</PERSON>, an actress and author who began her career as a dancer during the early days of the Soviet state under her original name of <LOCATION>Gevergeyeva</LOCATION>, it offers something more: a sense of completion, the lifting of a curtain on the past.
After the Revolution, when everything he owned was sequestered by the <ORGANIZATION>Bolsheviks</ORGANIZATION>, he was put in charge of the state's first Museum of Theater and Music, situated in <LOCATION>Ostrovsky Square</LOCATION>.
While she found out soon after the war that he had perished during the Siege of <LOCATION>Leningrad</LOCATION>, she didn't know until the curators arrived from the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> with the contents of this exhibition that he had died of starvation on a sofa in the museum.
For Americans, the most interesting of the 400 items on display in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> include designs by the German-born <PERSON>Andrei Roller</PERSON> (1805-91) for the <LOCATION>Russian</LOCATION> productions of important early 19th-century <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> ballets.
Among the most important of the <LOCATION>Petipa</LOCATION> ballerinas is <PERSON>Mathilde Kchessinska</PERSON>, represented in a series of fascinating photographs.
The mistress of <ORGANIZATION>Nicholas II</ORGANIZATION> until his engagement to <PERSON>Alexandra of Hesse-Darmstadt</PERSON>, she dominated the Imperial Ballet of <PERSON>St. Petersburg</PERSON> as much through her dancing as through her connections.
A 1910 photograph shows <LOCATION>Kchessinska</LOCATION> reclining on a chaise longue in her <LOCATION>St. Petersburg</LOCATION> mansion.
The Ballets Russes never appeared in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> and most of the important artifacts are in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>George Balanchine</PERSON>, to whom <PERSON>Ms. Geva</PERSON> was married as a teenager in 1923 and who began his career as an artistic revolutionary, also gets short shrift.
Better by far is the representation accorded the avant-garde dance that flourished in the <LOCATION>U.S.S.R.</LOCATION> until ruthlessly repressed during the <LOCATION>Stalin</LOCATION> years.
Miscellaneous and haphazard -- did we really need to see <PERSON>Anna Pavlova</PERSON>'s tea set or <PERSON>Marie Petipa</PERSON>'s slipper? -- the show invites uninformed, and thus superficial, viewing. 
Even the title is misleading: The exhibition covers ballet, not in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>, but only in what is now <LOCATION>Leningrad</LOCATION>.
The show closes in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> on Oct. 20 and reopens in <LOCATION>Saratoga</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, on May 19 at the <ORGANIZATION>National Museum of Dance</ORGANIZATION>, its co-sponsor. 
<ORGANIZATION>Trinity Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it reached a preliminary agreement to manufacture 1,000 coal rail cars for <ORGANIZATION>Norfolk Southern Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Trinity estimated the value of the pact at more than $40 million. 
It said the 1,000 rail cars are in addition to the 1,450 coal rail cars presently being produced for <LOCATION>Norfolk Southern</LOCATION>, a <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION>, Va.-based railroad concern. 
<ORGANIZATION>Keystone Consolidated Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> expects to report earnings before extraordinary tax benefits of about $1.5 million, or about 41 cents a share, for the third quarter, compared with a loss last year, said <PERSON>Glenn R. Simmons</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer. 
After a tax benefit of about $780,000, <ORGANIZATION>Keystone</ORGANIZATION> expects to report net income of $2.3 million, or about 62 cents a share, <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON> said.
A new $46 million steel rod minimill, which got off to a rocky start in early 1988, now is running efficiently and a new management team is more heavily marketing <ORGANIZATION>Keystone</ORGANIZATION>'s products, <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON> said. 
<PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON> said <PERSON>Keystone</PERSON>'s new mill is expected to produce about 585,000 tons of steel rods this year, up from 413,000 tons in 1988.
Production at the mill has exceeded the ability of <ORGANIZATION>Keystone</ORGANIZATION>'s casting operation to supply it, he said, which will force <PERSON>Keystone</PERSON> to purchase billet, or unfinished steel bars, from outside the company during the fourth quarter and next year. 
<PERSON>Keystone</PERSON> will have to consider expanding its casting operation, at an estimated cost of $8 million to $10 million, within the next 18 to 24 months, <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON> said. 
Under <PERSON>Robert W. Singer</PERSON>, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, <ORGANIZATION>Keystone</ORGANIZATION> has expanded its sales force to about 20 people from about 15 and hopes to expand its sales from the middle portion of the country toward the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> coasts. 
<ORGANIZATION>Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</ORGANIZATION> said it will increase its loan-loss provisions to cover all its loans to lesser developed countries, except <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, resulting in an after-tax charge to 1989 earnings of 300 million Canadian dollars (US$255 million). 
<PERSON>Don Bowder</PERSON>, senior vice president and chief accountant, said the bank's strong earnings enable it to be the first major <LOCATION>Canadian</LOCATION> bank to set aside provisions covering all its C$1.17 billion in non-Mexican <ORGANIZATION>LDC</ORGANIZATION> debt. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bowder</PERSON> said the bank will restructure its C$604 million of Mexican debt, of which C$255 million is in Mexican notes secured by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government bonds.
<PERSON>Mr. Bowder</PERSON> said the bank's experience with <ORGANIZATION>LDC</ORGANIZATION> debt has been "painful" and this latest move represents the final phase of a program begun seven years ago to reduce its exposure through provisioning, debt sales and debt swaps.
You've got a thicker billfold, but it has no economic significance whatsoever," says <PERSON>Leon Cooperman</PERSON>, a partner at <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
While a stock split accompanied by a dividend increase can pack a powerful punch, a split by itself "has no lasting impact on the stock price," says <PERSON>Mr. Cooperman</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs</ORGANIZATION>. 
Adds <PERSON>James L. Cochrane</PERSON>, senior vice president at the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>: "We've done research on this, and it shows a split really doesn't to seem to matter significantly." 
A few money managers even say a stock split sometimes may represent a sell signal. "Remember the old Wall Street adage: Buy on the rumor and sell on the news," says <PERSON>Samuel Thorne Jr.</PERSON>, a managing director at <ORGANIZATION>Scudder, Stevens & Clark</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>. 
"Stock splits are the biggest ripoff on Wall Street," contends <PERSON>Hans R. Reinisch</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor. "The only thing that changes with a split is the brokerage commissions, and they often go up sharply.
Among these is <PERSON>Warren E. Buffett</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Berkshire Hathaway Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, whose stock closed yesterday on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> at $8,700 a share. 
Underscoring his feelings on the subject, <PERSON>Mr. Buffett</PERSON> once sent a birthday greeting to a friend, wishing him good health and saying: "May you live until <ORGANIZATION>Berkshire</ORGANIZATION> splits." 
A stock split is "a nice exercise in cosmetics, but that's about all," says <PERSON>James H. Coxon</PERSON>, senior vice president and head of the common-stock division at <ORGANIZATION>Cigna Investments Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "It's a small net positive because it can improve the marketability of a particular stock.
A split's impact, if any, can depend on the company involved and the price of that company's stock, says <PERSON>John P. Rosenthal</PERSON>, senior partner of <ORGANIZATION>Silberberg, Rosenthal & Co</ORGANIZATION>.
Advises <PERSON>Michael Metz</PERSON>, a managing director at <ORGANIZATION>Oppenheimer & Co</ORGANIZATION>: "Just ignore splits." In his view, "They're irrelevant for the long-term investor.
Assuming the stock market doesn't crash again and completely discredit yuppies and trading rooms, American television audiences in a few months may be seeing <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s concept of both. "Capital City" is a weekly series that premiered here three weeks ago amid unprecedented hype by its producer, <ORGANIZATION>Thames Television</ORGANIZATION>. 
In producing and promoting "Capital City," <PERSON>Thames</PERSON> has spent about as much as <PERSON>Shane Longman</PERSON> loses on a good day.
Thames's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> marketing agent, <PERSON>Donald Taffner</PERSON>, is preparing to do just that.
<PERSON>Joanna Kanska</PERSON> looks like a young <PERSON>Zsa Zsa Gabor</PERSON>; <PERSON>William Armstrong</PERSON>, who plays <PERSON>Max</PERSON>, could pass for <PERSON>Hans Conreid</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Douglas Hodge</PERSON> (Declan) for <PERSON>James Farentino</PERSON>; <PERSON>Rolf Saxon</PERSON> is a passable <PERSON>Tommy Noonan</PERSON> and Dorian Healy could easily double for <PERSON>Huntz Hall</PERSON>, the blank-faced foil of the <ORGANIZATION>Bowery Boys</ORGANIZATION> comedies. 
So, OK kids, everybody on stage for "Carry On Trading": The cast is frantically searching the office for misplaced Japanese bonds that suddenly have soared in value because <ORGANIZATION>Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank</ORGANIZATION> has just bought the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Rustin</PERSON> is senior correspondent in the <ORGANIZATION>Journal</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> bureau. 
The survey examined the opinions of 550 randomly selected companies in the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> metropolitan area -- <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Westchester County</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> -- with annual sales between $5 million and $250 million. 
In <LOCATION>Westchester</LOCATION>, 51% of the executives anticipate hiring more, while in <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION> that number was 39% and in <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> 42%. 
Demand for products in the current quarter should weaken and inflation shouldn't put any upward pressure on prices, say <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> plant managers in a <ORGANIZATION>Dun & Bradstreet Corp.</ORGANIZATION> survey. 
Plant managers' optimism "has moderated, which is in line with current economic data that indicate slow but continuing economic growth," said <PERSON>Joseph W. Duncan</PERSON>, corporate economist and chief statistician for <ORGANIZATION>Dun & Bradstreet</ORGANIZATION>, a financial-data company. 
<ORGANIZATION>Dun & Bradstreet</ORGANIZATION>'s data measuring fourth-quarter costs of making a single unit of a product indicated that "manufacturers foresee weaker prices" for materials "while wage pressures, though still present, are not expected to escalate," <PERSON>Mr. Duncan</PERSON> said. 
<PERSON>Andrew Wallach</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert</ORGANIZATION>, is estimating <ORGANIZATION>Interpublic Group</ORGANIZATION>, for example, at 21 cents a share, up from 18 cents a share a year ago.
<PERSON>Greg Ostroff</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs</ORGANIZATION>, is pegging <ORGANIZATION>Omnicom Group</ORGANIZATION> at 17 cents a share, up from 15 cents a share, and <ORGANIZATION>Foote, Cone & Belding Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION> at 55 cents a share, up from 46 cents. 
Also notable is the fact that <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi & Saatchi Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>WPP Group PLC</ORGANIZATION>, two British giants that are principal players in the advertising business, don't report quarterly earnings. 
In the industry overall, "profits will increase unless revenues are disastrously lower," said <PERSON>Alan Gottesman</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. "There are no external indications" to indicate that will be the case, he said.
Others are cautiously watching the value of the dollar overseas. "From where I sit, the biggest issue for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> agencies is the dollar," said <PERSON>Emma Hill</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Wertheim Schroder & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. "For the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies, the risk is one of disappointment versus better-than-expected because of the dollar." Ad agencies rely heavily on business overseas for their bottom line.
Some agencies, including <ORGANIZATION>Interpublic Group</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Lintas</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi & Saatchi</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Backer Spielvogel Bates</PERSON>, have said that their clients are spending less than they had expected.
All eyes, however, are on the fourth quarter and to reporting by the giant British companies. "<ORGANIZATION>Saatchi & Saatchi</ORGANIZATION> is having a very tough year," <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Wallach</PERSON> said. "It's real guesswork figuring out what they'll earn." That agency, rumored as a takeover candidate, earlier this year said pretax profit for 1989 would trail 1988's already disappointing level.
For <ORGANIZATION>WPP Group</ORGANIZATION>, on the other hand, most analysts are looking for margin improvement and good results considering its acquisition earlier this year of <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy Group</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Walter Sisulu</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>African National Congress</ORGANIZATION> came home yesterday. 
And as the graying men returned to their homes, the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION>, outlawed in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> since 1960 and still considered to be the chief public enemy by the white government, defiantly returned to the streets of the country's black townships.
A huge <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> flag, with black, green and gold stripes, was hoisted over the rickety gate at <PERSON>Mr. Sisulu</PERSON>'s modest house, while on the street out front, boys displayed the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> colors on their shirts, caps and scarves.
At the small four-room home of <PERSON>Elias Motsoaledi</PERSON>, a leading <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> unionist and a former commander in the group's armed wing, <LOCATION>Umkhonto</LOCATION> we <LOCATION>Sizwe</LOCATION>, well-wishers stuck little <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> flags in their hair and a man tooted on an antelope horn wrapped in <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> ribbons. 
As the crowd outside his home shouted "<ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION>," the old man shot his fists into the air. "I'm inspired by the mood of the people." 
Under the laws of the land, the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> remains an illegal organization, and its headquarters are still in <LOCATION>Lusaka</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION>.
"The government can never put the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> back into the bottle again," said <PERSON>Cassim Saloojee</PERSON>, a veteran anti-apartheid activist on hand to welcome <PERSON>Mr. Sisulu</PERSON>. "Things have gone too far for the government to stop them now.
There was certainly no stopping the tide of <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> emotion last night, when hundreds of people jammed into the <ORGANIZATION>Holy Cross Anglican Church</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Soweto</LOCATION> for what became the first <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> rally in the country in 30 years.
And they called on the government to release <PERSON>Nelson Mandela</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION>'s leading figure, who was jailed with them and remains in prison.
President <PERSON>F.W. de Klerk</PERSON> released the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> men -- along with one of the founding members of the <ORGANIZATION>Pan Africanist Congress</ORGANIZATION>, a rival liberation group -- as part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed at giving blacks a voice in national government. 
As other repressive governments, particularly <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, have recently discovered, initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult, if not impossible, to control. 
As the days go by, the South African government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of <PERSON>Mr. Mandela</PERSON> as well as the continued banning of the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> and enforcement of the state of emergency.
The government is watching closely to see if their presence in the townships leads to increased anti-government protests and violence; if it does, <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION> will use this as a reason to keep <PERSON>Mr. Mandela</PERSON> behind bars.
In order to head off any divisions, <PERSON>Mr. Mandela</PERSON>, in a meeting with his colleagues before they were released, instructed them to report to the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION>Lusaka</LOCATION> as soon as possible. 
Says <PERSON>Peter Mokaba</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>South African Youth Congress</ORGANIZATION>: "We will be expecting them to act like leaders of the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION>." 
At last night's rally, they called on their followers to be firm, yet disciplined, in their opposition to apartheid. "We emphasize discipline because we know that the government is very, very sensitive," said <PERSON>Andrew Mlangeni</PERSON>, another early <LOCATION>Umkhonto</LOCATION> leader who is now 63. "We want to see <PERSON>Nelson Mandela</PERSON> and all our comrades out of prison, and if we aren't disciplined we may not see them here with us." 
@ <PERSON>Charles H. Tenney II</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Unitil Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, purchased 34,602 shares, or 4.9%, of <ORGANIZATION>Unitil</ORGANIZATION>'s common, according to a filing with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>. 
As previously reported, <ORGANIZATION>Unitil</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Exeter</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.H.</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Fitchburg Gas & Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Fitchburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, are targets of unsolicited tender offers from Boston-based <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Utilities Associates</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Eastern Utilities</ORGANIZATION> has offered $40 a share for <ORGANIZATION>Unitil</ORGANIZATION> and $36 a share for <ORGANIZATION>Fitchburg Gas</ORGANIZATION> and has extended both offers to Dec. 4.
The spokesman said the problems in the construction market relate mainly to "reduced volume in insulation and roofing, especially reroofing and commercial roofing products." He said roof repairs were relatively strong in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and should be strong in the <LOCATION>Southeast</LOCATION> during the fourth quarter as home and building owners repair property damaged by Hurricane Hugo. "But nationally, based on trends so far this year, we expect {that segment} to remain weak over all," he said. 
One, co-sponsored by <PERSON>Sen. Sam Nunn</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>) and Rep. <PERSON>Dave McCurdy</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Okla.</LOCATION>), would have restricted federal college subsidies to students who had served.
An omnibus bill assembled by <PERSON>Sen. Edward Kennedy</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>), and including some diluted Nunn-McCurdy provisions along with proposals by fellow <ORGANIZATION>Democratic</ORGANIZATION> Sens.
<PERSON>Claiborne Pell</PERSON>, <PERSON>Barbara Mikulski</PERSON> and <PERSON>Christopher Dodd</PERSON>, has been reported out of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Labor Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has outlined his own <ORGANIZATION>Youth Entering Service</ORGANIZATION> (YES) plan, though its details remain to be specified. 
Full-time residential programs also require housing and full-time supervision; they are particularly expensive -- more per participant than a year at <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Siemens AG</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> announced they have completed a 100 million-mark ($52.2 million) joint venture to produce electronics parts. 
In the venture's first fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION>Siemens</ORGANIZATION> will hold 74.9% of the venture and a <LOCATION>Matsushita</LOCATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION>Matsushita Electronic Components Co.</ORGANIZATION>, 25.1%. 
The company will have production facilities in <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. 
"They're draining in a consistently less aggressive manner and at a lower level," said <PERSON>James T. McGroarty</PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Greenwich Capital Markets</ORGANIZATION>. 
Speculation that the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> would sharply ease its credit reins was damped earlier this week when Chairman <PERSON>Alan Greenspan</PERSON> said central banks shouldn't focus too much on intermediate goals for exchange rates and interest rates. 
In <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Friday, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> currency opened for trading at 143.60 yen, down from Thursday's <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> close of 144.60 yen. 
"The market believes PPI will confirm <PERSON>Greenspan</PERSON>'s concern about inflation," said <PERSON>Francoise Soares-Kemp</PERSON>, a vice president with <ORGANIZATION>Credit Suisse</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
Vowing to continue his government's strategy of combating inflation with high interest rates, <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION>Conservative Party</ORGANIZATION> conference that the battle to rein in inflation required a strong currency.
He also avoided any mention of when <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> would bring sterling into the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, and warned there are "no easy answers" to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s economic problems. 
But entry has been opposed by Prime Minister <PERSON>Thatcher</PERSON>, who insists <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> should join from a position of strength. 
Wednesday's discount rate increase in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> continued to dominate trading in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, with dealers trying to guess what the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Japan</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> will do following the failure of the rate boost to depress the dollar. 
On the <ORGANIZATION>Commodity Exchange</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, gold for current delivery settled at $363.40 an ounce, up $1.40.
The <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> signed a treaty granting reciprocal access to their markets for most kinds of insurance products and services. 
The accord is an example "of the kind of relations the community wishes to develop with its European partners," said <PERSON>Edith Cresson</PERSON>, the French minister for <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> affairs who presided over a recent <ORGANIZATION>EC Council of Ministers</ORGANIZATION> meeting. 
As <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> partners, <PERSON>Mrs. Cresson</PERSON> cited in particular the members of the <ORGANIZATION>European Free Trade Association</ORGANIZATION>, composed of <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mrs. Cresson</PERSON> said she hopes the talks will show "a common resolve to go beyond bilateral, sectorial agreements," such as the one just signed with <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>. 
The treaty needs to be approved by the <ORGANIZATION>European Parliament</ORGANIZATION>, which is expected to endorse the measure, <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> officials said. 
<PERSON>Mrs. Cresson</PERSON> said a similar clause could be useful in future accords between the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> and other countries. 
The state-controlled insurer <ORGANIZATION>Assurances Generales de France</ORGANIZATION> said it has obtained regulatory approval to increase its stake in the financial holding company <ORGANIZATION>Cie. de Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> above 10% from the current level of about 8%. 
Both <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>AGF</ORGANIZATION> have been increasing their stakes in <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> recently for what they have termed "investment purposes," although the issue has been surrounded by takeover speculation in recent weeks. 
An <ORGANIZATION>AGF</ORGANIZATION> official did specify, however, that there was no foundation to recent rumors the group might be acting in concert with <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION>. 
For those hoping to see a modicum of political normalcy restored -- in view of <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>'s eight-year misadventure under autocratic pseudosocialism and subsequent three-month hitch with a conservative-communist coalition government -- there is but one bright sign: The scandals still encircling former Prime Minister <PERSON>Andreas Papandreou</PERSON> and his fallen socialist government are like flies buzzing around a rotting carcass. 
The ad interim coalition government that emerged from post-electoral hagglings was, in essence, little more than the ill-conceived offspring of ideological miscegenation: On one side, the center-right <ORGANIZATION>New Democracy Party</ORGANIZATION>, headed by <PERSON>Constantine Mitsotakis</PERSON>.
On the other, the so-called Coalition of the Left and <ORGANIZATION>Progress</ORGANIZATION> -- a quaint and rather deceptive title for a merger of the pro-Soviet <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party of Greece</ORGANIZATION> and its Euro-Communist cousin, the <ORGANIZATION>Hellenic Left</ORGANIZATION>. 
With regard to <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>'s long-bubbling bank-looting scandal, <PERSON>Mr. Papandreou</PERSON>'s principal accuser remains <PERSON>George Koskotas</PERSON>, former owner of the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Crete</ORGANIZATION> and self-confessed embezzler, now residing in a jail cell in <LOCATION>Salem</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, from where he is fighting extradition proceedings that would return him to <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>.
Nevertheless, the <ORGANIZATION>New Democracy</ORGANIZATION> and Communist parties herald his assertions as proof of <ORGANIZATION>PASOK</ORGANIZATION> complicity. 
Among unanswered questions are whether <PERSON>Mr. Papandreou</PERSON> received $23 million of stolen <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Crete</ORGANIZATION> funds and an additional $734,000 in bribes, as contended; whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some $57 million in <PERSON>Mr. Koskotas</PERSON>'s bank and then skim off the interest; and, what <ORGANIZATION>PASOK</ORGANIZATION>'s cut was from the $210 million <PERSON>Mr. Koskotas</PERSON> pinched. 
Two former ministers were so heavily implicated in the <LOCATION>Koskotas</LOCATION> affair that <ORGANIZATION>PASOK</ORGANIZATION> members of <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> voted to refer them to the special court.
But eluding parliamentary probe was the case of millions of drachmas <PERSON>Mr. Koskotas</PERSON> funneled into <ORGANIZATION>New Democracy</ORGANIZATION> coffers.
On another issue, Greeks were told how their national intelligence agency, the <ORGANIZATION>EYP</ORGANIZATION>, regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures, including key opposition politicians, journalists and <ORGANIZATION>PASOK</ORGANIZATION> cabinet members.
The coalition government tried to show that <ORGANIZATION>PASOK</ORGANIZATION> ministers had received hefty sums for OKing the purchase of F-16 Fighting Falcon and Mirage 2000 combat aircraft, produced by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>based <ORGANIZATION>General Dynamics Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s Avions <PERSON>Marcel Dassault</PERSON>, respectively.
Naturally, neither <ORGANIZATION>General Dynamics</ORGANIZATION> nor <PERSON>Dassault</PERSON> could be expected to hamper its prospective future dealings by making disclosures of sums paid (or not) to various Greek officials for services rendered. 
So it seems that <PERSON>Mr. Mitsotakis</PERSON> and his communist chums may have unwittingly served <PERSON>Mr. Papandreou</PERSON> a moral victory on a platter: <LOCATION>PASOK</LOCATION>, whether guilty or not, can now traipse the countryside condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at <PERSON>Mr. Papandreou</PERSON>'s expense.
First came his predictable fusillade: He charged the <ORGANIZATION>Coalition of the Left</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Progress</ORGANIZATION> had sold out its leftist tenets by collaborating in a right-wing plot aimed at ousting PASOK and thwarting the course of socialism in <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>. 
Next, he continued to court the communists -- many of whom feel betrayed by the left-right coalition's birth -- by bringing into <LOCATION>PASOK</LOCATION> a well-respected <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> candidate.
For balance, and in hopes of gaining some disaffected centrist votes, he managed to attract a former <ORGANIZATION>New Democracy Party</ORGANIZATION> representative and known political enemy of <PERSON>Mr. Mitsotakis</PERSON>.
<LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>'s bilateral relations with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> need attention soon as well.
For one, the current accord concerning <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military bases in <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION> lapses in May 1990.
Another matter of concern is the extradition of <PERSON>Mohammed Rashid</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Palestinian</LOCATION> terrorist who is wanted in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> for the 1982 bombing of a <ORGANIZATION>Pan American Airways</ORGANIZATION> flight.
That <ORGANIZATION>PASOK</ORGANIZATION> could win the elections outright is improbable; the <LOCATION>Greek</LOCATION> press, previously eager to palm off <LOCATION>PASOK</LOCATION>'s line, has turned on <PERSON>Mr. Papandreou</PERSON> with a wild-eyed vengeance.
<ORGANIZATION>New Democracy</ORGANIZATION> has once again glaringly underestimated the opponent and linked its own prospects to negative reaction against <LOCATION>PASOK</LOCATION>, forgetting to tend to either program clarity or the rectification of internal squabbles. 
<PERSON>Mr. Carpenter</PERSON>, a regional correspondent for <ORGANIZATION>National Review</ORGANIZATION>, has lived in <LOCATION>Athens</LOCATION> since 1981. 
Giant, a <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, collection of companies that is controlled by <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> producer <PERSON>Burt Sugarman</PERSON>, didn't give a reason for halting its plan to acquire the airline, and <ORGANIZATION>Aspen</ORGANIZATION> officials couldn't be reached for comment. 
Giant hasn't ever disclosed the proposed price, although <ORGANIZATION>Avmark Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION>, Va.-based aircraft consulting concern, has valued <ORGANIZATION>Aspen</ORGANIZATION>'s fleet at about $46 million. 
It all seemed innocent enough: Last April, one <PERSON>Steven B. Iken</PERSON> visited <ORGANIZATION>Justin Products Inc.</ORGANIZATION> here, identified himself as a potential customer and got the word on the little company's new cassette players for children. 
"It is almost identical to the <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> product," <PERSON>Mr. Iken</PERSON> remarked, after seeing prototypes and pictures.
Replied a <LOCATION>Justin</LOCATION> salesman: "Exactly." The <ORGANIZATION>Justin</ORGANIZATION> merchandise carried wholesale prices some 40% below those of <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s "My First <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>" line.
But instead of a new customer -- part of a hoped-for bonanza from underselling <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> -- <PERSON>Justin</PERSON> got a costly legal morass.
<PERSON>Mr. Iken</PERSON>, it turned out, was a private detective using a hidden tape recorder to gather information for <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>.
Seeking to keep <PERSON>Justin</PERSON>'s "My Own" product line off the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market, <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> last May filed a suit in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> federal court accusing the upstart of trademark infringement, unfair competition and other violations of business law. 
Since then, life has changed a lot for 61-year-old <PERSON>Leonard Kaye</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Justin</ORGANIZATION>'s owner. "I haven't been able to get a decent night's sleep since this has been going on," he says. "It's the most distracting thing in my life -- I can't even attend to my business." His company (annual sales: about $25 million) may suffer a costly blow -- losing an estimated 10% of total sales -- if <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> (annual sales: about $16 billion) prevails.
With considerable irony, the case also shows how completely <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> has turned the tables on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> business.
Now <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>, whose innovative, premium-priced products are among the most admired in consumer electronics, is bitterly complaining about a little <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> firm with a cheap look-alike produced in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. 
"The gist of this is that <PERSON>Justin</PERSON> knocked off the <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> line and <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> wants to stop it," says <PERSON>Lewis H. Eslinger</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>'s attorney, who previously guarded <PERSON>Rubik</PERSON>'s Cube. (<ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> itself declines to comment.) If <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> wins, <PERSON>Mr. Eslinger</PERSON> says, its little rival will have to try to sell the products overseas.
<PERSON>Mr. Kaye</PERSON> denies the suit's charges and says his only mistake was taking on <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> in the marketplace. "I made a similar line and I produced it cheaper," he says. 
Today, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Judge <PERSON>John E. Sprizzo</PERSON> is expected to rule on <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>'s renewed request for a pre-trial order blocking sale of the disputed products, on which deliveries began in July.
The judge turned down an earlier <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> request for such an order -- a decision upheld on appeal -- but <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> returned with additional evidence and arguments. 
But the battle is more than <ORGANIZATION>Justin</ORGANIZATION> bargained for. "I had no idea I was getting in so deep," says <PERSON>Mr. Kaye</PERSON>, who founded <ORGANIZATION>Justin</ORGANIZATION> in 1982.
<PERSON>Mr. Kaye</PERSON> had sold <ORGANIZATION>Capetronic Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> electronics maker, and retired, only to find he was bored.
With <PERSON>Justin</PERSON>, he began selling toys and electronics made mostly in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>, beginning with <ORGANIZATION>Mickey Mouse</ORGANIZATION> radios.
Like many others, <PERSON>Mr. Kaye</PERSON> took notice in 1987 when <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>, in a classic example of market segmentation, changed the plastic skin and buttons on the famous Walkman line of portable audio equipment and created the My First <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> line for children.
<ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> found a new market niche, but <PERSON>Mr. Kaye</PERSON> figured that its prices left plenty of room for a lower-priced competitor.
<ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> uses mostly red and blue, with traces of yellow -- and so does <PERSON>Justin</PERSON>, on the theory that kids prefer these colors. ("To be successful, a product can be any color whatsoever, as long as it is fire-engine red," says <PERSON>Charles E. Baxley</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Justin</ORGANIZATION>'s attorney.) 
By last winter, <PERSON>Justin</PERSON> was showing prototypes at toy fairs in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> -- and <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> noticed.
Indeed, concerned that <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> sales personnel were threatening legal action or other retaliation -- such as withholding desirable <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> products -- against <ORGANIZATION>Justin</ORGANIZATION>'s customers, <PERSON>Mr. Baxley</PERSON> fired off a letter to <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> in April.
He himself threatened to take the matter to the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Trade Commission</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>.
But <PERSON>Justin</PERSON> hasn't pursued those charges (which were without merit, according to <PERSON>Mr. Eslinger</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> attorney).
And <PERSON>Justin</PERSON>, in a news release, says, "Once competitive, <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> now resorts to strong-arm tactics in <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> courtrooms to carve out and protect niche markets." 
He also insists that <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>, no less than others, has a legal right to protect its "trade dress," in this case, mostly the colors that it claims make My First <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> products distinctive. (<ORGANIZATION>Justin</ORGANIZATION> claims it began using the same colors on electronic goods for children long before <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> entered the children's market.) 
Whatever its merits, <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>'s aggressive defense is debilitating for <ORGANIZATION>Justin</ORGANIZATION>.
Of <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Kaye</PERSON> says: "They know there's no way for them to lose.
This was seen in the late 1960s in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> and the mid-1970s in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
Look no further than metropolitan <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Denver</PERSON>, two of the most depressed, overbuilt and potentially undervalued real-estate markets in the nation.
Of course, some observers have touted <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> for the past five years as a counter-cyclical play.
<LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> is another metropolitan area where the commercial real-estate market has overreacted to the region's economic trends, although <PERSON>Denver</PERSON> has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>.
What real-estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>'s or <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>'s?
Generally, overcapacity in commercial real estate is dropping from its mid-1980s peak, even in such economically healthy metropolitan areas as <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Leinberger</PERSON> is managing partner of a real-estate advisory firm based in <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. 
Mexican investor <PERSON>Joel Rocha Garza</PERSON> said he sold a block of 600,000 shares of <ORGANIZATION>Smith Laboratories Inc.</ORGANIZATION> common stock to companies affiliated with him. 
In a filing with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Rocha Garza</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Biscayne Syndicate Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Lahus II Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Lahus III Inc.</ORGANIZATION> bought the 600,000 shares on Oct. 11 for $1.4 million, or $2.375 a share. 
<PERSON>Mr. Rocha Garza</PERSON> said that he, <ORGANIZATION>Clarendon Group Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Biscayne</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Lahus II</PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION>Lahus III</ORGANIZATION> are all affiliated and hold a combined stake of 1,234,100 shares, or 9.33%.
In <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Smith Laboratories</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Timothy Wollaeger</PERSON> said the transfer of the shares isn't significant. 
"In our business," says <ORGANIZATION>Groupe Bull</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Francis Lorentz</PERSON>, "one and one sometimes add up to 1.1, or 1.2, but rarely two." 
Bull says it intends to retain existing management of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unit and keep the <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> label, while selling <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> personal computers -- a product line in which Bull had been lagging -- as part of Bull data-processing systems. 
Merger or not, the <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> acquisition is a key part of <PERSON>Mr. Lorentz</PERSON>'s plan to grow Bull -- the world's 11th biggest computer company last year -- into a profitable member of the top five or six computer makers.
The other key to <ORGANIZATION>Bull</ORGANIZATION>'s future health is its other <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> leg.
Bull last year increased to 69.4% its controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION>Honeywell Bull Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Honeywell Inc.</ORGANIZATION> retains 15.6%, and <ORGANIZATION>NEC Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> owns the remaining 15%.
In addition, <ORGANIZATION>Bull</ORGANIZATION> renamed the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> company <ORGANIZATION>Bull HN Information Services Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Bull HN</ORGANIZATION> reports to <PERSON>Mr. Lorentz</PERSON> as chairman of holding company <ORGANIZATION>Cie. des Machines Bull</ORGANIZATION>.
During the past decade or so, <ORGANIZATION>Bull</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Honeywell</PERSON> tried various approaches to combining their businesses, none of which really jelled. "We were spending all our energies internally, while externally the world was changing at breakneck speed," <PERSON>Mr. Lorentz</PERSON> says. 
But now, with Bull in firm control, these <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> operations are key ingredients in <PERSON>Mr. Lorentz</PERSON>'s plans to ensure that <ORGANIZATION>Bull</ORGANIZATION> remains one of the half-dozen or so world-wide, full-range computer companies likely to survive the 1990s.
To do so, Bull is planting itself firmly in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, where, says <PERSON>Mr. Lorentz</PERSON>, a lot of the best people and research are.
The <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> buy means Bull will derive 22% of its revenue from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> -- up from 18% previously -- and the company spends 30% of its 3.64 billion-franc research and development budget in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
Keeping <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> relatively independant, says <PERSON>Mr. Lorentz</PERSON>, makes sense because "they are completely different cultures, making personal computers, like <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>, and making mainframes like <ORGANIZATION>Bull</ORGANIZATION>." He says disarmingly: "We aren't fast enough.
"It is absolutely essential to keep <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>'s originality, its extraordinary force," the 47-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Lorentz</PERSON> adds. 
<PERSON>Mr. Lorentz</PERSON> succeeded <PERSON>Jacques Stern</PERSON> as chairman of Bull in June, and like his predecessor, he is a crusader for "open software" -- that is standards that will work on the machines of various makers -- in order to give smaller companies like <ORGANIZATION>Bull</ORGANIZATION> a chance against industry giants.
<PERSON>Mr. Lorentz</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Stern</PERSON>'s No. 2 since 1982, inherits the task of making Bull the biggest and healthiest European soup-to-nuts computer company, competing globally with the likes of <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Unisys Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, and a handful of Japanese companies.
Counting only sales of computer equipment, <ORGANIZATION>Bull</ORGANIZATION> is already the biggest in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, ahead of <ORGANIZATION>Siemens AG</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> and Ing.
<ORGANIZATION>C. Olivetti & Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Lorentz</PERSON> says. 
<PERSON>Mr. Lorentz</PERSON>, an intense, cerebral product of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s elite "Ecole National d'Administration" likes to go rock climbing in his spare time, and used to practice the martial art of aikido.
After having added <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> PCs to the Bull stable, <PERSON>Mr. Lorentz</PERSON> says, the company will be better armed for battle especially in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. "Our biggest asset is that we are well implanted in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> will be the fastest growing market in the world over the next 10 years." But the conquest of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> will happen, in part, from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
"The information industry is global," says <PERSON>Mr. Lorenz</PERSON>, "but the image of that industry is created in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, so we must be present in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in order to be known everywhere else.
<ORGANIZATION>Matra Communications S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s defense and electronics group, <ORGANIZATION>Matra S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, said it expects strong profit growth in both 1989 and 1990. 
<ORGANIZATION>American Physicians</ORGANIZATION> said it also replaced four <ORGANIZATION>Texas American</ORGANIZATION> representatives on Prime's five-member board. 
Prime, based in <LOCATION>Bedminster</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, provides management services to cardiac rehabilitation clinics and diagnostic imaging centers.
<PERSON>Robert E. Lyons III</PERSON>, 39, who headed the company's <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> region, was appointed president and chief operating officer, succeeding <PERSON>Gary Wilber</PERSON>. 
Analysts, who were expecting <ORGANIZATION>Alcoa</ORGANIZATION> to post around $2.70 to $3 a share, were surprised at the lackluster third-quarter results. "It's disappointing," said <PERSON>William Siedenburg</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
Excluding the higher tax rate, which rose two percentage points to 38%, and the negative exchange rate adjustment, the company would have met analysts' expectations, said <PERSON>R. Wayne Atwell</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading Friday, <ORGANIZATION>Alcoa</ORGANIZATION> closed at $72 a share, down $4.75, in a sharply lower market. 
"The market is overvalued, not cheap," says <PERSON>Alan Gaines</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> money-management firm <LOCATION>Gaines Berland</LOCATION>.
Lenders are growing increasingly nervous about debt-financed takeovers, investment bankers say. "You had a week of a deteriorating junk-bond market that ran smack into the news on Friday about what appeared to be happening to the bank debt market," says <PERSON>Steven Rattner</PERSON>, a partner and merger specialist with <ORGANIZATION>Lazard Freres & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
The group trying to buy <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> announced Friday that it couldn't arrange the $7.2 billion in bank loans it needs to buy the parent of <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION> for $300 a share. 
After <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>, the stock viewed as most vulnerable is <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION>' parent <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION>, the target of a $120-a-share takeover proposal from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> real estate developer <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>.
Late Friday night, the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION>Jefferies & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> securities firm, traded <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> shares at prices as low as 80.
Similarly, <ORGANIZATION>Delta Air Lines</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>USAir Group</ORGANIZATION> dropped 10.1% and 8.5%, respectively, on Friday and could weaken further. 
<ORGANIZATION>Vitro S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, a major Mexican glass maker, said yesterday that it agreed to buy Anchor Glass Container in a tender offer for $21.25 a share, sweetened from the original $20-a-share offer <PERSON>Vitro</PERSON> launched two months ago.
For the broader market, the greatest significance of the Vitro-Anchor deal may be that it was put together late Friday night -- after the market rout -- and involves a $155 million temporary "bridge" loan from <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities</ORGANIZATION> and a $139 million loan from <ORGANIZATION>Security Pacific National Bank</ORGANIZATION>. 
Moreover, to complete the entire Anchor Glass purchase and refinance existing debt, <PERSON>Donaldson</PERSON> said it is "highly confident" that it will be able to sell $400 million of junk bonds for <LOCATION>Vitro</LOCATION>, despite the current disarray in the junk bond market.
<PERSON>Donaldson</PERSON>'s statement isn't merely an idle boast, because those bonds will have to be sold before <PERSON>Donaldson</PERSON>'s bridge loan can be paid back.
<ORGANIZATION>Security Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, said it expects to arrange $430 million in bank loans for <LOCATION>Vitro</LOCATION>. 
In another takeover battle, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>McCaw Cellular Communications</ORGANIZATION> said yesterday that <PERSON>McCaw</PERSON> has been advised by three commercial banks that they remain "highly confident" they can arrange $4.5 billion of bank loans for <ORGANIZATION>McCaw</ORGANIZATION>'s tender offer for about 45% of <ORGANIZATION>LIN Broadcasting</ORGANIZATION>, "notwithstanding recent events." 
McCaw is offering $125 a share for 22 million <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> shares, thereby challenging <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION>'s proposal to spin off its television properties, pay shareholders a $20-a-share special dividend and combine its cellular-telephone operations with <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth</ORGANIZATION>'s cellular business. 
Traders and investment bankers said <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> shares weren't hurt much because <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth</ORGANIZATION> is viewed as a well-financed corporate buyer unlikely to be affected by skittishness among bankers or bond buyers. 
Potential bidders for companies "were saying that things were beginning to look expensive," says <PERSON>Mr. Rattner</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Lazard</ORGANIZATION>. 
"In the past, corporate buyers were often discouraged from making bids because of competition from <ORGANIZATION>LBO</ORGANIZATION> firms, which were often prepared to outbid" the corporations, says <PERSON>J. Tomilson Hill</PERSON>, head of mergers and acquisitions at <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Columbia Pictures Entertainment</ORGANIZATION>, which has agreed to a friendly $27-a-share bid from <ORGANIZATION>Sony of Japan</ORGANIZATION>, fell only 1/8 to close at 26 5/8. 
They include <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION>, down 11.7%; <ORGANIZATION>Upjohn</ORGANIZATION>, down 11.1%; <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Soup</ORGANIZATION>, down 11%; <ORGANIZATION>Paramount Communications</ORGANIZATION>, off 10.3%; <PERSON>Woolworth</PERSON>, down 10.2%; <ORGANIZATION>Delta Air Lines</ORGANIZATION>, down 10.1%, and <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION>, down 9.7%. 
Examples include <PERSON>Kollmorgen</PERSON>, whose agreement to be acquired for $25 a share by <LOCATION>Vernitron</LOCATION> collapsed last month.
Shares of <ORGANIZATION>American Medical International</ORGANIZATION>, which agreed last week to accept a lower price from a buy-out group that includes <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON>Pritzker</PERSON> family of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, fell 15.8% on Friday to close at 20.
People familiar with <PERSON>Hilton</PERSON> said over the weekend that the depth of the sell-off in <LOCATION>Hilton</LOCATION> shares was unwarranted because none of the likely buyers would be dependent on junk-bond financing.
<PERSON>William Lebo</PERSON>, <PERSON>Hilton</PERSON>'s general counsel, said plans to consider a sale of the company or some of its assets are "on track" for what has been described previously as "a slow and deliberate process." 
"I can't believe that any potential buyer for <PERSON>Hilton</PERSON> would be affected by one day's trading," <PERSON>Mr. Lebo</PERSON> said. 
For debt-ridden suitors, "the takeover game has been over for some time," says <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> money manager <PERSON>Neil Weisman</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Chilmark Capital</ORGANIZATION>, who has been keeping 85% of his portfolio in cash. "The market is just waking up to that point." 
<PERSON>Pauline Yoshihashi</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> contributed to this column. 
<ORGANIZATION>Investcorp</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said it and the management of <ORGANIZATION>Sports & Recreation Inc.</ORGANIZATION> bought the operator of the 10-store <ORGANIZATION>Sports Unlimited</ORGANIZATION> chain for some $40 million. 
The investment bank becomes majority shareholder in <ORGANIZATION>Sports & Recreation</ORGANIZATION>, a 10-year-old sporting goods retailer, said <PERSON>Oliver E. Richardson</PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION>Investcorp</ORGANIZATION>'s management committee and a director of the chain. 
Sports Unlimited, <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, posted revenue of $59 million for the year ended July 31.
In 1982, <ORGANIZATION>Sports & Recreation</ORGANIZATION>'s managers and certain passive investors purchased the company from <ORGANIZATION>Brunswick Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Skokie</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill</LOCATION>.
Striking auto workers ended their 19-day occupation of a metal shop at a <LOCATION>Peugeot S.A.</LOCATION> factory in eastern <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> Friday as pay talks got under way in the capital. 
Their withdrawal was based on promises by <PERSON>Peugeot</PERSON> to open negotiations in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> at the same time the last man left the premises. 
Axa-Midi Assurances of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> gave details of its financing plans for its proposed $4.5 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Farmers Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, in amended filings with insurance regulators in the nine <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> states where Farmers operates. 
The proposed acquisition is part of Sir <PERSON>James Goldsmith</PERSON>'s unfriendly takeover attempt for <ORGANIZATION>B.A.T Industries PLC</ORGANIZATION>, the British tobacco, retailing, paper and financial services concern that is parent of Los Angeles-based Farmers.
In an attempt to appease <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> regulators' concern over a <ORGANIZATION>Goldsmith</ORGANIZATION> acquisition of Farmers, Sir <PERSON>James</PERSON> in August agreed to sell Farmers to <LOCATION>Axa</LOCATION> if he is successful in acquiring B.A.T. 
As part of the agreement, <ORGANIZATION>Axa</ORGANIZATION> agreed to invest $1 billion in <ORGANIZATION>Hoylake Investments Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, Sir <PERSON>James</PERSON>'s acquisition vehicle. 
Of the total $5.5 billion to be paid to <LOCATION>Hoylake</LOCATION> by <LOCATION>Axa</LOCATION>, about $1 billion will come from available resources of <ORGANIZATION>Axa</ORGANIZATION>'s parent, <ORGANIZATION>Axa-Midi Group</ORGANIZATION>, $2.25 billion will be in the form of notes issued by <LOCATION>Axa</LOCATION>, and the remaining $2.25 billion will be in long-term bank loans. 
The other banking companies in the group are <ORGANIZATION>Credit Lyonnais</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Societe Generale</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>BankAmerica Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>, he said. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bebear</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Axa-Midi Group</ORGANIZATION> has "more than $2.5 billion of non-strategic assets that we can and will sell" to help pay off debt from the acquisition.
The amended filings also point out that under a new agreement, <ORGANIZATION>Hoylake</ORGANIZATION> has an absolute obligation to sell Farmers to <LOCATION>Axa</LOCATION> upon an acquisition of B.A.T. "We hope that with what we did, the regulators will not need to evaluate <LOCATION>Hoylake</LOCATION>, and they can directly look at the agreement with us, because <ORGANIZATION>Hoylake</ORGANIZATION> won't be an owner of Farmers at anytime," <PERSON>Mr. Bebear</PERSON> said. 
The amended filings were required because of the new agreement between <LOCATION>Axa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hoylake</LOCATION>, and to reflect the extension that Sir <PERSON>James</PERSON> received last month under British takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition.
<ORGANIZATION>Hoylake</ORGANIZATION> dropped its initial #13.35 billion ($20.71 billion) takeover bid after it received the extension, but said it would launch a new bid if and when the propsed sale of Farmers to <LOCATION>Axa</LOCATION> receives regulatory approval. 
The new financing structure is still a very-highly leveraged one, and <PERSON>Axa</PERSON> still plans to take out 75% of Farmers' earnings as dividends to service their debt." That dividend is almost double the 35% currently taken out of Farmers by <ORGANIZATION>B.A.T</ORGANIZATION>, the spokesman added. "It would have severe implications for Farmers' policy holders." 
<ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas Corp.</ORGANIZATION> received a $54.3 million <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> contract for F/A18 aircraft for <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Propper International Inc.</ORGANIZATION> won a $20.2 million <ORGANIZATION>Defense Logistics Agency</ORGANIZATION> contract for camouflage trousers. 
<ORGANIZATION>Altama Delta Corp.</ORGANIZATION> was given an $18.5 million <ORGANIZATION>Defense Logistics Agency</ORGANIZATION> contract for combat boots. 
<ORGANIZATION>First Federal Savings Bank</ORGANIZATION> said holders voted to approve its proposed merger with <ORGANIZATION>First American Federal Savings & Loan Association</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala</LOCATION>. 
Dismal sales at <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> dragged the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> car and truck market down below year-ago levels in early October, the first sales period of the 1990 model year. 
Without <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>, overall sales for the other <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> automakers were roughly flat with 1989 results. 
Some of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auto makers have already adopted incentives on many 1990 models, but they may have to broaden their programs to keep sales up. "We've created a condition where, without incentives, it's a tough market," said <PERSON>Tom Kelly</PERSON>, sales manager for <PERSON>Bill Wink Chevrolet</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Dearborn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich</LOCATION>. 
All of the <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> divisions except <ORGANIZATION>Cadillac</ORGANIZATION> showed big declines.
<ORGANIZATION>Cadillac</ORGANIZATION> posted a 3.2% increase despite new competition from Lexus, the fledging luxury-car division of <ORGANIZATION>Toyota Motor Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Lexus sales weren't available; the cars are imported and <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION> reports their sales only at month-end. 
<ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION>'s plant in <LOCATION>Marysville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, was gearing up to build 1990 model Accords, a <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. "We're really confident everything will bounce back to normal," he added. 
It controls the sole national TV network, <PERSON>Doordarshan</PERSON>, and the only national radio system, <ORGANIZATION>All India Radio</ORGANIZATION>.
In recent months, however, critics say the coverage has been so biased toward Prime Minister <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON> and his ruling <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> (I) Party that what is labeled news is merely propaganda.
Many say <PERSON>Mr. Gandhi</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> (I), with seesawing popularity and an arms scandal that has tarnished the government, stand a chance of losing power.
Television came to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> in 1965, when black-and-white broadcasts began in <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>.
Doordarshan is controlled by the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Information and Broadcasting</ORGANIZATION> and often takes orders directly from the prime minister's office, some <PERSON>Doordarshan</PERSON> staff members contend. 
From around that time, the critics say, items on <PERSON>Mr. Gandhi</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> (I) have increasingly dominated the nationwide evening news and have been overwhelmingly positive, while the opposition has been given short shrift or blatantly abused. 
Says Probhat <PERSON>Chandra Chatterji</PERSON>, one of the pioneers of Indian broadcasting and a former director-general of <ORGANIZATION>All India Radio</ORGANIZATION> and Doordarshan: "It is debatable whether this propaganda will bring votes to the government.
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> shares recovered some lost ground, largely on technical factors as Chancellor <PERSON>Nigel Lawson</PERSON>'s speech to the <ORGANIZATION>Conservative Party</ORGANIZATION> conference was viewed as basically neutral for the market. 
In the first hour of trading in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Friday, the <ORGANIZATION>Nikkei Index</ORGANIZATION> rose 145.96 points to 34941.01. 
Moreover, the current high level of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stock market, and the possibility of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> interest rates being cut or Japanese rates being raised again to keep the dollar down, might draw funds currently invested in Japanese equities into the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market, some investors fear. 
<PERSON>Masami Okuma</PERSON>, senior trader at <ORGANIZATION>UBS Phillips & Drew International</ORGANIZATION>, said expectations of another increase in the discount rate already are causing some investors not only to stop buying but also to dump some of their recently acquired shares. 
<PERSON>Yoshiaki Mitsuoka</PERSON>, manager of the investment information department at <ORGANIZATION>Daiwa Investment Trust & Management Co.</ORGANIZATION>, said the market had been sustained recently by smaller issues with relatively low price-earnings ratios.
<PERSON>Yukio Itagaki</PERSON>, director of the fund management department at <ORGANIZATION>Kokusai Investment Trust Management Co.</ORGANIZATION>, said the discount rate increase didn't have much effect on the actual market environment, as short-term interest rates already had been above 5%.
<ORGANIZATION>Nippon Steel</ORGANIZATION> fell 10 to 698 yen ($4.83) a share, <ORGANIZATION>Sumitomo Metal</ORGANIZATION> lost 19 to 677, and <PERSON>Kobe Steel</PERSON> was down 9 at 690.
<LOCATION>Kajima</LOCATION> was down 100 at 1,900, while <ORGANIZATION>Ohbayashi</ORGANIZATION> lost 60 to 1,500. 
<ORGANIZATION>Kawasaki Heavy Industries</ORGANIZATION> fell 37 to 903, and <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Heavy Industries</ORGANIZATION> was down 30 at 1,010.
Among housing issues, <ORGANIZATION>Misawa Homes</ORGANIZATION> lost 140 to 2,830, <ORGANIZATION>Sekisui House</ORGANIZATION> declined 70 to 2,400, and <ORGANIZATION>Daiwa House</ORGANIZATION> lost 100 to 2,470. 
<PERSON>Seiyu</PERSON> was down 240 at 2,710, <ORGANIZATION>Daiei</ORGANIZATION> fell 70 to 2,980, and <LOCATION>Isetan</LOCATION> lost 170 to 4,720. 
<PERSON>Hitachi</PERSON> lost 10 to 1,510, <LOCATION>Toshiba</LOCATION> was down 40 at 1,130, and <ORGANIZATION>Toyota Motor</ORGANIZATION> lost 30 to 2,820. 
Other gainers included <ORGANIZATION>Nippon Shokubai</ORGANIZATION>, which rose 70 to 2,270, <LOCATION>Nikon</LOCATION>, up 30 to 1,620, and <ORGANIZATION>Aiwa</ORGANIZATION>, which gained 120 to 2,000. 
In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Financial Times-Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> 100-share index finished 19 points higher at 2237.8.
Chancellor <PERSON>Lawson</PERSON>, who has been under political fire for his decision a week ago to force <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> banks' base lending rates up to 15%, an eight-year high, addressed the governing Conservatives' annual conference on current economic issues, and dealers said the speech was exactly what the market had expected. 
That energy came in part from renewed rumors that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> takeover specialists <PERSON>Kohlberg Kravis Roberts</PERSON> are preparing to make a takeover bid for industrial concern <ORGANIZATION>BTR</ORGANIZATION> rather than simply take a 15% stake in it.
<ORGANIZATION>British Aerospace</ORGANIZATION> said earlier in the week that it was considering making a joint bid with <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s Thomson-CSF for <ORGANIZATION>Ferranti</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>ASDA Group</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> food retailer, closed 4 higher at 163 after holders approved the company's acquisition of 61 stores from <LOCATION>Isosceles</LOCATION>.
Other companies in the food sector also firmed on active volume, with <ORGANIZATION>Argyll Group</ORGANIZATION> gaining 8 to 223, <ORGANIZATION>Tesco</ORGANIZATION> up 1/2 to 194 1/2 and <PERSON>J. Sainsbury</PERSON> advancing 3 to 255. 
<ORGANIZATION>British Steel</ORGANIZATION> edged 2 higher to 126 1/2 on 8.3 million shares, <ORGANIZATION>British Telecommuncations</ORGANIZATION> settled 6 higher at 268, and <ORGANIZATION>British Petroleum</ORGANIZATION> gained 1 to 307 1/2. 
In other European markets, share prices ended higher in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, lower in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION> and mixed in <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION>.
Elsewhere, stocks rose in <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> and were lower in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>. 
Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION>.
The involvement of units of two major <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> banks in separate loans to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has signaled a growing willingness among foreign bankers to resume lending to the <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> government. 
One of the units, <ORGANIZATION>BT Asia Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Bankers Trust New York Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, this week arranged the syndication of a $50 million, five-year loan to <ORGANIZATION>Shortridge Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, which is owned by <ORGANIZATION>China International Trust & Investment Corp.</ORGANIZATION> (Holdings), or <LOCATION>Citic</LOCATION>.
The loan will be used for <ORGANIZATION>Shortridge</ORGANIZATION>'s share of the purchase of a satellite, a BT <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> director said. 
The other unit, <ORGANIZATION>Chase Manhattan Asia Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Chase Manhattan Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said it is underwriting a $50 million loan for <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s biggest trading company, <ORGANIZATION>China Resources</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Holdings</ORGANIZATION>) <LOCATION>Co.</LOCATION>, for general corporate purposes.
Amid the international outcry following the shooting of students and bystanders in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> on June 4, foreign-bank lending to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> came to a halt. 
Bankers in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> said this week's <ORGANIZATION>Citic</ORGANIZATION> loan was an important sign that foreign banks are interested in resuming regular business with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. "It's sort of a benchmark," said a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> banker who didn't participate in the loan. 
<PERSON>Russell L. Magarity</PERSON>, senior managing director of <LOCATION>Chase Manhattan Asia</LOCATION>, said "it is time" to start considering loans to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> again.
<PERSON>Mr. Magarity</PERSON> said <PERSON>Chase</PERSON> hopes to assemble an international group of banks in the lending syndicate, including some of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Japanese banks with which <ORGANIZATION>China Resources</ORGANIZATION> has had a strong relationship in recent years. "Right now we think we can successfully syndicate this loan because of <ORGANIZATION>China Resources</ORGANIZATION>' name," he said. 
Indeed, the reputations of <ORGANIZATION>China Resources</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Citic</ORGANIZATION> played a significant role in the decisions.
<LOCATION>China Resources</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Citic</ORGANIZATION> are considered exceptionally good credit risks, bankers said.
<ORGANIZATION>Citic</ORGANIZATION>, which acts as a sort of merchant bank for overseas acquisitions by <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, is a relatively independent company.
Through <PERSON>Shortridge</PERSON>, it is one of three partners in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Satellite Telecommunications Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which plans to launch a private satellite on a <LOCATION>Chinese</LOCATION> rocket next year.
The other partners are <ORGANIZATION>Cable & Wireless PLC</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>.
The loan was syndicated to a group of foreign banks from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, foreign bankers said; they didn't identify the institutions.
The official said <ORGANIZATION>Citic</ORGANIZATION> will pay an interest rate that will be about 0.5 percentage point higher than the amount <ORGANIZATION>Citic</ORGANIZATION> would have paid for a similar borrowing before June 4.
The suit named the company, former chief executive officer <PERSON>William G. Moore Jr.</PERSON>, former vice president <PERSON>Robert W. Reedy</PERSON> and five defendants who weren't part of the company.
The suit charged the defendants with causing <PERSON>Peter E. Voss</PERSON>, an ex-member of the <ORGANIZATION>Postal Service</ORGANIZATION> board of governors, to accept $23,000 in bribes, kickbacks and gratuities.
In the agreement, <ORGANIZATION>Recognition</ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay the government $20,000 in return for the release of all claims against the company, <PERSON>Mr. Moore</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Reedy</PERSON>.
In a related development, <ORGANIZATION>Recognition Equipment</ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION>Postal Service</ORGANIZATION> has barred the company from bidding on postal contracts for an additional 120 days.
<PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> is currently the subject of a $1.1 billion federal anti-racketeering lawsuit accusing him of bleeding off assets of a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> thrift he controlled, <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln Savings & Loan Association</ORGANIZATION>, and driving it into insolvency. 
<PERSON>Fred Wertheimer</PERSON> -- president of <ORGANIZATION>Common Cause</ORGANIZATION>, the self-styled citizens lobby -- said <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> already has conceded attempting to buy influence with the lawmakers -- Democratic Sens.
<PERSON>Dennis DeConcini</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Alan Cranston</PERSON> of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <PERSON>John Glenn</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Donald Riegle</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>; and GOP <PERSON>Sen. John McCain</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Wertheimer</PERSON> based this on a statement by <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> that was quoted in a Wall Street Journal story in April: "One question . . . had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause.
In a highly unusual meeting in <PERSON>Sen. DeConcini</PERSON>'s office in April 1987, the five senators asked federal regulators to ease up on <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION>.
According to notes taken by one of the participants at the meeting, the regulators said <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> was gambling dangerously with depositors' federally insured money and was "a ticking time bomb." <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> had complained that the regulators were being too zealous. 
The notes show that <PERSON>Sen. DeConcini</PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Home Loan Bank Board</ORGANIZATION>'s regulations "grossly unfair," and that <PERSON>Sen. Glenn</PERSON> insisted that <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON>'s thrift was "viable and profitable." 
For the next two years, the <ORGANIZATION>Bank Board</ORGANIZATION>, which at the time was the agency responsible for regulating thrifts, failed to act -- even after federal auditors warned in May 1987 that <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> had caused <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> to become insolvent.
<PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION>American Continental Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, entered bankruptcy-law proceedings this April 13, and regulators seized the thrift the next day.
The newly formed <ORGANIZATION>Resolution Trust Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, successor to the <ORGANIZATION>Bank Board</ORGANIZATION>, filed suit against <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> and several others on Sept. 15. 
In the midst of his 1988 re-election campaign, <PERSON>Sen. Riegle</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Banking Committee</ORGANIZATION>, returned $76,000 in contributions after a <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> newspaper said that <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> had gathered the money for him about two weeks before the meeting with regulators. 
<PERSON>Sen. DeConcini</PERSON>, after months of fending off intense press criticism, returned $48,000 only last month, shortly after the government formally accused <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> of defrauding <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>. 
In addition, <PERSON>Sen. McCain</PERSON> last week disclosed that he belatedly had paid $13,433 to <ORGANIZATION>American Continental</ORGANIZATION> as reimbursement for trips he and his family took aboard the corporate jet to <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON>'s vacation home at Cat Cay, the <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION>, from 1984 through 1986.
<PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON>, his family members and associates also donated $112,000 to <PERSON>Sen. McCain</PERSON>'s congressional campaigns over the years, according to press accounts.
But <PERSON>Sen. McCain</PERSON> says <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> broke off their friendship abruptly in 1987, because the senator refused to press the thrift executive's case as vigorously as <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> wanted. "He became very angry at that, left my office and told a number of people that I was a wimp," <PERSON>Sen. McCain</PERSON> recalls. 
In July, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> newspapers disclosed that <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> gave $850,000 in corporate funds to three tax-exempt voter registration organizations in 1987 and 1988 at the behest of <PERSON>Sen. Cranston</PERSON>, who conceded that soliciting the money was "a pretty stupid thing to do politically." In addition, <PERSON>Sen. Cranston</PERSON> received $47,000 in campaign donations through <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION>California Democratic</ORGANIZATION> party received $85,000 in corporate donations for a 1986 get-out-the-vote drive that benefited the senator's re-election campaign that year. 
Also in July, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> newspapers disclosed $200,000 in corporate donations by <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION>National Council on Public Policy</ORGANIZATION>, a political committee controlled by <PERSON>Sen. Glenn</PERSON>.
That was in addition to $34,000 in direct campaign donations arranged by <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> to the <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> senator. 
<PERSON>Mr. Wertheimer</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Ethics Committee should hire a special outside counsel to conduct an investigation, as was done in the case of former <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON>James Wright</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Sen. Riegle</PERSON> said he would cooperate with any inquiry, but that his conduct had been "entirely proper." <PERSON>Sen. McCain</PERSON> said he had been "deeply concerned" at the time of the meeting that it might seem to be improper, but decided it was "entirely appropriate" for him to seek fair treatment for a constituent. 
<PERSON>Sen. Glenn</PERSON> said he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and "I am completely satisfied to let this matter rest in the hands of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Ethics Committee</ORGANIZATION>." <PERSON>Sen. DeConcini</PERSON> said, "When all is said and done, I expect to be fully exonerated." 
<PERSON>Sen. Cranston</PERSON>, who had already volunteered his help to the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Bureau of Investigation</ORGANIZATION> in any investigation of <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON>, portrayed his role in 1987 as prodding regulators to act. "Why didn't the <ORGANIZATION>Bank Board</ORGANIZATION> act sooner?" he said. "That is what Common Cause should ask be investigated." 
Indeed, some pros see Friday's plunge, plus any further damage that might occur early this week, as a chance for bargain hunting. "There has been a lot of emotional selling that presents a nice buying opportunity if you've got the cash," says <PERSON>Stephen B. Timbers</PERSON>, chief investment officer of Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION>Kemper Financial Services Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
But most advisers think the immediate course for individual investors should be to stand pat. "When you see a runaway train," says <PERSON>Steve Janachowski</PERSON>, partner in the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> investment advisory firm <ORGANIZATION>Brouwer & Janachowski</ORGANIZATION>, "you wait for the train to stop." 
The best thing individual investors can do is "just sit tight," says <PERSON>Marshall B. Front</PERSON>, executive vice president and head of investment counseling at <ORGANIZATION>Stein Roe & Farnham Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based investment counseling firm that manages about $18 billion. 
<PERSON>Roger Ibbotson</PERSON>, professor of finance at <ORGANIZATION>Yale University</ORGANIZATION> and head of the market information firm <ORGANIZATION>Ibbotson Associates Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, says, "My real advice would be to just ride through it.
<PERSON>John Snyder</PERSON>, former president of the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Investors Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, an organization of investment clubs and individual investors, says his fellow club members didn't sell in the crash of 1987, and see no reason to sell now. "We're dedicated long-term investors, not traders," he says. "We understand panics and euphoria.
Friday's action "was an old-fashioned panic," says <PERSON>Alfred Goldman</PERSON>, director of technical market analysis for <ORGANIZATION>A.G. Edwards & Sons</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>. "Stocks were being thrown out of windows at any price." His advice: "You ought to be there with a basket catching them." 
Stocks such as <ORGANIZATION>Hershey Foods Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>American International Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Federal National Mortgage Association</ORGANIZATION> became such bargains that he couldn't resist them, he says. 
<PERSON>Mr. Front</PERSON> of <PERSON>Stein Roe</PERSON> suggests that any buying should "concentrate in stocks that have lagged the market on the up side, or stocks that have been beaten down a lot more than the market in this correction." His firm favors selected computer, drug and pollution-control stocks. 
On Thursday, <PERSON>William Fleckenstein</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> money manager, used futures contracts in his personal account to place a bet that the broad market averages would decline.

A survey by the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>'s 12 district banks shows economic growth has been sluggish in recent weeks, while upward pressures on prices have moderated. "The economy is clearly slowing," says <PERSON>Robert Black</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Richmond Federal Reserve Bank</ORGANIZATION>. 
"If you look at the third quarter as posting roughly 2.5% growth, I do see some slowing in the fourth quarter," agrees <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Fed</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Roger Guffey</PERSON>. 
Nevertheless, both <PERSON>Mr. Guffey</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Black</PERSON> say the slowdown so far is no cause for concern. "We're coming closer to achieving the stated objective of slowing the economy to a point where hopefully some downward trend in prices will occur," said <PERSON>Mr. Guffey</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration officials are looking to the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> to bring down rates, and financial markets seem to be expecting easier credit as well. "I think the market had been expecting the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> to ease sooner and a little more than it has to date," said <PERSON>Robert Johnson</PERSON>, vice president of global markets for <ORGANIZATION>Bankers Trust Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
Several <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> governors in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> have been pushing for easier credit; but many of the regional <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> presidents have been resisting such a move. 
Analysts were disappointed that the enthusiasm investors showed for stocks in the wake of <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s $3.18 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION>Great Northern Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION> evaporated so quickly.
The flow of Japanese funds has set in motion "a process whereby these economies will be knitted together by the great Japanese investment machine," says <PERSON>Robert Hormats</PERSON>, vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs International Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
In <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>, for example, the government's <ORGANIZATION>Board of Investment</ORGANIZATION> approved $705.6 million of Japanese investment in 1988, 10 times the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> investment figure for the year.
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s commitment in <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> also includes steep increases in foreign assistance and trade. 
<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>'s other cash-rich countries are following <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s lead and pumping capital into the region.
In <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>, rising wages are forcing manufacturers to seek other overseas sites for labor-intensive production.
These nations, known as <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>'s "little tigers," also are contributing to <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION>'s integration, but their influence will remain subordinate to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s. 
For recipient countries such as <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>, the investment will provide needed jobs and spur growth.
Because of budget constraints in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> encourages <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to share economic burdens in the region.
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s swelling investment in <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> is part of its economic evolution.
These nations' internal decisions "will be made in a way not to offend their largest aid donor, largest private investor and largest lender," says <PERSON>Richard Drobnick</PERSON>, director of the international business and research program at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Southern California</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Graduate School of Business</ORGANIZATION>. 
Rather, Japanese investment will spur integration of certain sectors, says <PERSON>Kent Calder</PERSON>, a specialist in East Asian economies at the <ORGANIZATION>Woodrow Wilson School for Public and Internatonal Affairs</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Princeton University</ORGANIZATION>.
In electronics, for example, a Japanese company might make television picture tubes in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, assemble the sets in <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> and export them to <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>. 
"The effect will be to pull <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> together not as a common market but as an integrated production zone," says <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Hormats</PERSON>. 
Participants will include the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> as well as the six members of the <ORGANIZATION>Association of Southeast Asian Nations</ORGANIZATION> -- <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>. 
In addition, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> this year offered its own plan for cooperation around the Pacific rim in a major speech by Secretary of State <PERSON>James Baker</PERSON>, following up a proposal made in January by Australian Prime Minister <PERSON>Bob Hawke</PERSON>. 
The <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> proposal reasserts <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s intention to continue playing a leading political role in the region. "In <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, as in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, a new order is taking shape," <PERSON>Mr. Baker</PERSON> said. "The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, with its regional friends, must play a crucial role in designing its architecture." 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> not only outstrips the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in investment flows but also outranks it in trade with most Southeast Asian countries (although the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> remains the leading trade partner for all of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>).
While <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials voice optimism about <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s enlarged role in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, they also convey an undertone of caution. "There's an understanding on the part of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> has to expand its functions" in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, says <PERSON>J. Michael Farren</PERSON>, undersecretary of commerce for trade. "If they approach it with a benevolent, altruistic attitude, there will be a net gain for everyone." 
Some Asian nations are apprehensive about <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s demand that <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> step up its military spending to ease the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> security burden in the region.
The issue is further complicated by uncertainty over the future of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>'s leases on military bases in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> and by a possible <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troop reduction in <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>.
"No one wants the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> to pick up its marbles and go home," <PERSON>Mr. Hormats</PERSON> says. 
For their part, <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> are expected to step up their own investments in the next decade to try to slow the Japanese juggernaut. 
"They don't want <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to monopolize the region and sew it up," says <PERSON>Chong-sik Lee</PERSON>, professor of East Asian politics at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION>. 
But Apple II was a major advance from Apple I, which was built in a garage by <PERSON>Stephen Wozniak</PERSON> and <PERSON>Steven Jobs</PERSON> for hobbyists such as the <ORGANIZATION>Homebrew Computer Club</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>William Gates</PERSON> and <PERSON>Paul Allen</PERSON> in 1975 developed an early language-housekeeper system for PCs, and <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> became an industry billionaire six years after <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> adapted one of these versions in 1981.
<PERSON>Alan F. Shugart</PERSON>, currently chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Seagate Technology</ORGANIZATION>, led the team that developed the disk drives for PCs.
<PERSON>Dennis Hayes</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dale Heatherington</PERSON>, two <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> engineers, were co-developers of the internal modems that allow PCs to share data via the telephone. 
<ORGANIZATION>Lorillard Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the unit of <LOCATION>New</LOCATION> York-based <ORGANIZATION>Loews Corp.</ORGANIZATION> that makes Kent cigarettes, stopped using crocidolite in its Micronite cigarette filters in 1956. 
Neither <ORGANIZATION>Lorillard</ORGANIZATION> nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the Kent cigarettes. "We have no useful information on whether users are at risk," said <PERSON>James A. Talcott</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Dana-Farber Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Dr. Talcott</PERSON> led a team of researchers from the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION> and the medical schools of <ORGANIZATION>Harvard University</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Boston University</ORGANIZATION>. 
The percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the <LOCATION>West Groton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in <LOCATION>Western</LOCATION> industrialized countries, he said.
The plant, which is owned by <ORGANIZATION>Hollingsworth & Vose Co.</ORGANIZATION>, was under contract with <ORGANIZATION>Lorillard</ORGANIZATION> to make the cigarette filters. 
The finding probably will support those who argue that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos, chrysotile, found in most schools and other buildings, <PERSON>Dr. Talcott</PERSON> said. 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is one of the few industrialized nations that doesn't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth, needle-like fibers such as crocidolite that are classified as amphobiles, according to <PERSON>Brooke T. Mossman</PERSON>, a professor of pathlogy at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Vermont College of Medicine</ORGANIZATION>.
"There's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos-related diseases," said <PERSON>Darrell Phillips</PERSON>, vice president of human resources for <ORGANIZATION>Hollingsworth & Vose</ORGANIZATION>. "But you have to recognize that these events took place 35 years ago.
Safety advocates, including some members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, have been urging the department for years to extend car-safety requirements to light trucks and vans, which now account for almost one-third of all vehicle sales in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
They didn't have much luck during the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration. "But now, there seems to be a fairly systematic effort to address the problem," said <PERSON>Chuck Hurley</PERSON>, vice president of communications for the <ORGANIZATION>Insurance Institute for Highway Safety</ORGANIZATION>. "We're in a very different regulatory environment." <PERSON>Sen. John Danforth</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>) praised the department's actions, noting that rollover crashes account for almost half of all light-truck deaths. "We could prevent many of these fatalities with minimum roof-crush standards," he said. 
In <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION> official said the company currently has no rear-seat lap and shoulder belts in its light trucks, but plans to begin phasing them in by the end of the 1990 model year.
<PERSON>John Leinonen</PERSON>, executive engineer of <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's auto-safety office, said Ford trucks have met car standards for roof-crush resistance since 1982.
<PERSON>Mr. Leinonen</PERSON> said he expects <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> to meet the deadline easily. 
"The Cosby Show" may have single-handedly turned around ratings at <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> since its debut in 1984, and the <PERSON>Huxtable</PERSON> family still keeps millions of viewers laughing Thursday night on the network. 
<ORGANIZATION>Viacom</ORGANIZATION> denies it's using pressure tactics. "We're willing to negotiate," says <PERSON>Dennis Gillespie</PERSON>, executive vice president of marketing. "We're offering this plan now because we feel it's the right time." 
One station manager says he believes <ORGANIZATION>Viacom</ORGANIZATION>'s move is a "pre-emptive strike" because the company is worried that "Cosby" ratings will continue to drop in syndication over the next few years. "Cosby" is down a full ratings point in the week of Oct. 2-8 over the same week a year ago, according to <ORGANIZATION>A.C. Nielsen Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Gillespie</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Viacom</ORGANIZATION> says the ratings are rising. 
And executives at stations in such major markets as <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Providence</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>R.I.</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Raleigh</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>, say they may very well not renew "Cosby." <PERSON>Dick Lobo</PERSON>, the general manager of <ORGANIZATION>WTVJ</ORGANIZATION>, the NBC-owned station in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, for example, says the show has "been a major disappointment to us." "At the prices we were charged, there should have been some return for the dollar.
<PERSON>Neil Kuvin</PERSON>, the general manager of <ORGANIZATION>WHAS</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> affiliate in <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>, says "Cosby" gets the station's highest ratings and he's "pleased." But he adds, "I feel pressured, disappointed, uncomfortable and, frankly, quite angry with <ORGANIZATION>Viacom</ORGANIZATION>." 
The discussions were disclosed as the bank holding company said that it has dropped its longstanding opposition to full interstate banking bills in <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> and in <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>.
Currently, both <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, where most of <ORGANIZATION>Bank of New England</ORGANIZATION>'s operations are, allow interstate banking only within <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Richard Driscoll</PERSON>, vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Bank of New England</ORGANIZATION>, told the Dow Jones Professional Investor Report, "Certainly, there are those outside the region who think of us prospectively as a good partner.
When <PERSON>Warren Winiarski</PERSON>, proprietor of <ORGANIZATION>Stag's Leap Wine Cellars</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Napa Valley</LOCATION>, announced a $75 price tag for his 1985 Cask 23 Cabernet this fall, few wine shops and restaurants around the country balked. "This is the peak of my wine-making experience," <PERSON>Mr. Winiarski</PERSON> declared when he introduced the wine at a dinner in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, "and I wanted to single it out as such." 
For years, this group included a stable of classics -- <LOCATION>Bordeaux</LOCATION> first growths (Lafite-Rothschild, Latour, Haut-Brion, Petrus), <LOCATION>Grand Cru</LOCATION> Burgundies (Romanee-Conti and La Tache) deluxe Champagnes (Dom Perignon or Roederer Cristal), rarefied sweet wines (Chateau Yquem or Trockenbeerenauslesen Rieslings from <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, and Biondi-Santi Brunello Riserva from <LOCATION>Tuscany</LOCATION>).
None of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s wine regions can steal a march on <LOCATION>Burgundy</LOCATION>, however.
Another small <LOCATION>Burgundy</LOCATION> estate, <ORGANIZATION>Coche-Dury</ORGANIZATION>, has just offered its 1987 Corton-Charlemagne for $155. 
From <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> there is Angelo Gaja Barbaresco at $125 a bottle, <PERSON>Piero Antinori</PERSON>'s La Solaia, a $90 Cabernet from <LOCATION>Tuscany</LOCATION>, and Biondi-Santi Brunello at $98.
<LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s Vega Secilia Unico 1979 (released only in its 10th year) is $70, as is <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s Grange Hermitage 1982. 
"There are certain cult wines that can command these higher prices," says <PERSON>Larry Shapiro</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Marty</ORGANIZATION>'s, one of the largest wine shops in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>. "What's different is that it is happening with young wines just coming out.
Owner <PERSON>Al Brownstein</PERSON> originally planned to sell it for $60 a bottle, but when a retailer in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> asked, "Is that wholesale or retail?" he re-thought the matter.
"We thought it was awfully expensive," said <PERSON>Sterling Pratt</PERSON>, wine director at <ORGANIZATION>Schaefer</ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION>Skokie</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, one of the top stores in suburban <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, "but there are people out there with very different opinions of value.
"It's just sort of a one-upsmanship thing with some people," added <PERSON>Larry Shapiro</PERSON>. "They like to talk about having the new Red Rock Terrace {one of <ORGANIZATION>Diamond Creek</ORGANIZATION>'s Cabernets} or the <ORGANIZATION>Dunn</ORGANIZATION> 1985 Cabernet, or the Petrus.
But consumers who buy at this level are also more knowledgeable than they were a few years ago. "They won't buy if the quality is not there," said <PERSON>Cedric Martin</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Martin Wine Cellar</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>. "Or if they feel the wine is overpriced and they can get something equally good for less." <PERSON>Mr. Martin</PERSON> has increased prices on some wines (like <ORGANIZATION>Grgich Hills</ORGANIZATION> Chardonnay, now $32) just to slow down movement, but he is beginning to see some resistance to high-priced red Burgundies and Cabernets and Chardonnays in the $30 to $40 range. 
In every major market in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, for instance, you can buy '86 La Tache or Richebourg, virtually all of the first growth <LOCATION>Bordeaux</LOCATION> (except Petrus), as well as Opus One and Dominus from <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and, at the moment, the <ORGANIZATION>Stag's Leap</ORGANIZATION> 1985 Cask 23.

Take a look, then, at the main attack commercials that set the tone for Tuesday's elections in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>: 
<LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>: The screen fills with a small, tight facial shot of <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON>, Democratic candidate for mayor of <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>. "<PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON> failed to file his income taxes for four straight years," says a disembodied male voice. 
And then this television commercial, paid for by Republican <PERSON>Rudolph Giuliani</PERSON>'s campaign and produced by <PERSON>Roger Ailes</PERSON>, the master of negative TV ads, really gets down to business.
"Nasty innuendoes," says <PERSON>John Siegal</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON>'s issues director, "designed to prosecute a case of political corruption that simply doesn't exist." 
Stung by the <PERSON>Giuliani</PERSON> ads, <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON>'s TV consultants, <PERSON>Robert Shrum</PERSON> and <PERSON>David Doak</PERSON>, finally unleashed a negative ad of their own.
The city's <ORGANIZATION>Campaign Finance Board</ORGANIZATION> has refused to pay <PERSON>Mr. Dinkins</PERSON> $95,142 in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete.
<PERSON>Mr. Giuliani</PERSON>'s campaign chairman, <PERSON>Peter Powers</PERSON>, says the <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> ad is "deceptive." The other side, he argues, "knows <PERSON>Giuliani</PERSON> has always been pro-choice, even though he has personal reservations.
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>: Democratic Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Douglas Wilder</PERSON> opened his gubernatorial battle with Republican <PERSON>Marshall Coleman</PERSON> with an abortion commercial produced by <PERSON>Frank Greer</PERSON> that analysts of every political persuasion agree was a tour de force.
Then, just as an image of the statue of <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON> dissolves from the screen, the announcer continues: "On the issue of abortion, <PERSON>Marshall Coleman</PERSON> wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians." 
That commercial -- which said <PERSON>Mr. Coleman</PERSON> wanted to take away the right of abortion "even in cases of rape and incest," a charge <PERSON>Mr. Coleman</PERSON> denies -- changed the dynamics of the campaign, transforming it, at least in part, into a referendum on abortion.
The ad prompted <PERSON>Mr. Coleman</PERSON>, the former <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> attorney general, to launch a series of advertisements created by <PERSON>Bob Goodman</PERSON> and designed to shake <PERSON>Mr. Wilder</PERSON>'s support among the very women who were attracted by the abortion ad. 
"People have grown tired of these ads and <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> has gotten the stigma of being a negative campaigner," says <PERSON>Mark Rozell</PERSON>, a political scientist at <ORGANIZATION>Mary Washington College</ORGANIZATION>. "<PERSON>Wilder</PERSON> has managed to get across the idea that <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> will say anything to get elected governor and -- more important -- has been able to put the onus for all the negative campaigning on <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON>." 
By Tuesday night, television stations were carrying new ads featuring <PERSON>Mr. Coleman</PERSON> himself raising questions about <PERSON>Mr. Wilder</PERSON>'s sensitivity to rape victims. 
<LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>: The attacks began when Democratic Rep. <PERSON>James Florio</PERSON> aired an ad featuring a drawing of Pinocchio and a photograph of <PERSON>Mr. Florio</PERSON>'s rival, Republican Rep. <PERSON>Jim Courter</PERSON>. "Remember Pinocchio?" says a female voice. "Consider <PERSON>Jim Courter</PERSON>." 
The only fraud involved, cry <PERSON>Mr. Courter</PERSON>'s partisans, is the <PERSON>Florio</PERSON> commercial itself, and so the <PERSON>Courter</PERSON> campaign has responded with its own Pinocchio commercial, produced by <PERSON>Mr. Ailes</PERSON>.
In this one, the screen fills with photographs of both candidates. "Who's really lying?" asks a female voice. "<PERSON>Florio</PERSON>'s lying," the voice goes on, because "the barrel on <PERSON>Courter</PERSON>'s land . . . contained heating oil, was cleaned up and caused no pollution." 
<PERSON>Mr. Courter</PERSON>'s long nose shrinks while <PERSON>Mr. Florio</PERSON>'s grows. 
<PERSON>Stephen Salmore</PERSON>, a political scientist at <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey's Eagleton Institute</ORGANIZATION>, says it's another example of an ad that's true but not fully accurate.
Even so, according to <PERSON>Mr. Salmore</PERSON>, the ad was "devastating" because it raised questions about <PERSON>Mr. Courter</PERSON>'s credibility.
In 1966, on route to a re-election rout of Democrat <PERSON>Frank O'Connor</PERSON>, GOP Gov. <PERSON>Nelson Rockefeller</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> appeared in person saying, "If you want to keep the crime rates high, <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> is your man." 
In part, this may reflect the fact that `she speaks a more progressive language' than her husband, as <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s Prof. <PERSON>{Ethel} Klein</PERSON> puts it.
The statistics imply that three-quarters of blacks approve of <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>'s job performance and 85% of blacks approve of <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON>.

Your Oct. 13 page-one story on the renewed plight of <ORGANIZATION>Western Union</ORGANIZATION> says that <ORGANIZATION>Western Union</ORGANIZATION> had lost its chance to be in the telephone business by turning down <PERSON>Alexander Graham Bell</PERSON>'s offer to it of his invention, because it supposedly felt that voice communication would never replace the telegraph. 
Bell's father-in-law, <PERSON>Gardner G. Hubbard</PERSON>, wealthy and well-connected, obtained financing to start the <ORGANIZATION>American Bell Telephone Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, which even had a subsidiary in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> called the <ORGANIZATION>Telephone Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
It acquired <PERSON>Thomas Edison</PERSON>'s microphone patent and then immediately sued the <ORGANIZATION>Bell Co.</ORGANIZATION> claiming that the microphone invented by my grandfather, <PERSON>Emile Berliner</PERSON>, which had been sold to <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> for a princely $50,000, infringed upon <ORGANIZATION>Western Union</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Edison</PERSON> patent.
When <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> established that the <PERSON>Berliner</PERSON> patent caveat was registered 10 days before <PERSON>Edison</PERSON>'s application, <ORGANIZATION>Western Union</ORGANIZATION> dropped the lawsuit and agreed never to enter the telephone business -- the basis for the company's current plight.

What's more, the test and Learning Materials are both produced by the same company, <ORGANIZATION>Macmillan/McGraw-Hill</ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture of <ORGANIZATION>McGraw-Hill Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Macmillan</ORGANIZATION>'s parent, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Maxwell Communication Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
"If I took {these preparation booklets} into my classroom, I'd have a hard time justifying to my students and parents that it wasn't cheating," says <PERSON>John Kaminski</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Traverse City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, teacher who has studied test coaching.
"It's as if <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> decided to give only French history questions to students in a European history class, and when everybody aces the test, they say their kids are good in European history," says <PERSON>John Cannell</PERSON>, an <LOCATION>Albuquerque</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.M.</LOCATION>, psychiatrist and founder of an educational research organization, <ORGANIZATION>Friends for Education</ORGANIZATION>, which has studied standardized testing. 
The most widely used of these tests are <ORGANIZATION>Macmillan/McGraw</ORGANIZATION>'s CAT and Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills; the <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> Test of Basic Skills, by <ORGANIZATION>Houghton Mifflin Co.</ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION>Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's Metropolitan Achievement Test and Stanford Achievement Test. 
In <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, educators say they are common classroom tools. 
<PERSON>Michael Kean</PERSON>, director of marketing for <ORGANIZATION>CTB Macmillan/McGraw</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Macmillan/McGraw</ORGANIZATION> division that publishes Learning Materials, says it isn't aimed at improving test scores.
<PERSON>Mr. Kaminski</PERSON>, the schoolteacher, and <PERSON>William Mehrens</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Michigan State University</ORGANIZATION> education professor, concluded in a study last June that CAT test versions of Scoring High and Learning Materials shouldn't be used in the classroom because of their similarity to the actual test.
<PERSON>Kaminski</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mehrens</PERSON> are ignoring "the need students have for becoming familiar with tests and testing format." He said authors of Scoring High "scrupulously avoid" replicating exact questions, but he doesn't deny that some items are similar. 
But in 1988, <ORGANIZATION>McGraw-Hill</ORGANIZATION> purchased the <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> unit that publishes Scoring High, which later became part of <ORGANIZATION>Macmillan/McGraw</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Brownell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kean</PERSON> say they are unaware of any efforts by <ORGANIZATION>McGraw-Hill</ORGANIZATION> to modify or discontinue Scoring High. 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s domestic sales of cars, trucks and buses in October rose 18% from a year earlier to 500,004 units, a record for the month, the <ORGANIZATION>Japan Automobile Dealers' Association</ORGANIZATION> said. 
State court <PERSON>Judge Richard Curry</PERSON> ordered <ORGANIZATION>Edison</ORGANIZATION> to make average refunds of about $45 to $50 each to <ORGANIZATION>Edison</ORGANIZATION> customers who have received electric service since April 1986, including about two million customers who have moved during that period.
<PERSON>Judge Curry</PERSON> ordered the refunds to begin Feb. 1 and said that he wouldn't entertain any appeals or other attempts to block his order by <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Edison</ORGANIZATION>. "The refund pool . . . may not be held hostage through another round of appeals," <PERSON>Judge Curry</PERSON> said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Edison</ORGANIZATION> said it is already appealing the underlying commission order and is considering appealing <PERSON>Judge Curry</PERSON>'s order. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Edison</ORGANIZATION> closed at $38.375, down 12.5 cents. 
The $2.5 billion Byron 1 plant near <LOCATION>Rockford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, was completed in 1985.
In a disputed 1985 ruling, the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Edison</ORGANIZATION> could raise its electricity rates by $49 million to pay for the plant.
The <ORGANIZATION>Illinois Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> ordered the commission to audit <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Edison</ORGANIZATION>'s construction expenses and refund any unreasonable expenses.
<ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Edison</ORGANIZATION> now faces an additional court-ordered refund on its summer/winter rate differential collections that the <ORGANIZATION>Illinois Appellate Court</ORGANIZATION> has estimated at $140 million.
And consumer groups hope that <PERSON>Judge Curry</PERSON>'s Byron 1 order may set a precedent for a second nuclear rate case involving <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Edison</ORGANIZATION>'s Braidwood 2 plant.
<PERSON>John D. Carney</PERSON>, 45, was named to succeed <PERSON>Mr. Hatch</PERSON> as president of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Edison</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Robert P. Tassinari</PERSON>, 63, was named senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Utilities</ORGANIZATION>.
Preliminary tallies by the <ORGANIZATION>Trade and Industry Ministry</ORGANIZATION> showed another trade deficit in October, the fifth monthly setback this year, casting a cloud on <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>'s export-oriented economy. 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, claiming some success in its trade diplomacy, removed <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> from a list of countries it is closely watching for allegedly failing to honor <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> patents, copyrights and other intellectual-property rights. 
However, five other countries -- <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> -- will remain on that so-called priority watch list as a result of an interim review, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON>Carla Hills</PERSON> announced.
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade negotiators argue that countries with inadequate protections for intellectual-property rights could be hurting themselves by discouraging their own scientists and authors and by deterring <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> high-technology firms from investing or marketing their best products there. 
<PERSON>Mrs. Hills</PERSON> lauded <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> for creating an intellectual-property task force and special enforcement teams of police officers and prosecutors trained to pursue movie and book pirates.
<LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> has improved its standing with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> by initialing a bilateral copyright agreement, amending its trademark law and introducing legislation to protect foreign movie producers from unauthorized showings of their films.
<LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>, for its part, has vowed to enact a copyright law compatible with international standards and to apply the law to computer software as well as to literary works, <PERSON>Mrs. Hills</PERSON> said. 
Those countries -- including <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> -- are still of some concern to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> but are deemed to pose less-serious problems for American patent and copyright owners than those on the "priority" list. 
<PERSON>Gary Hoffman</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> lawyer specializing in intellectual-property cases, said the threat of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> retaliation, combined with a growing recognition that protecting intellectual property is in a country's own interest, prompted the improvements made by <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>. "What this tells us is that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade law is working," he said.
<PERSON>Mrs. Hills</PERSON> said that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is still concerned about "disturbing developments in <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> and continuing slow progress in <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>." She didn't elaborate, although earlier <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade reports have complained of videocassette piracy in <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> and disregard for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> pharmaceutical patents in <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION>. 
Officials from both nations say the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> public's skittishness about Japanese investment could color a second round of bilateral economic talks scheduled for next week in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
Not that <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> disagree on the Japanese acquisitions; indeed, each has come out in favor of unfettered investment in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
Where they disagree is on the subject of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> direct investment in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> wants the removal of what it perceives as barriers to investment; <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> denies there are real barriers.
The Japanese "should see this rhetoric as a signal of the need for a change in their own economy," says <PERSON>Charles Dallara</PERSON>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> assistant <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> secretary, who has been in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> this week informally discussing the impending negotiations with government and business leaders. 
"We have a long history of maintaining an open direct-investment policy," <PERSON>Mr. Dallara</PERSON> says. "<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> investors should have a greater opportunity at direct investment" in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
One clear sign of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s nervousness came this week, when a spokesman for <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> devoted nearly all of a regular, half-hour briefing for foreign journalists to the subject of recent Japanese investments in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
"We believe that it is vitally important for those Japanese business interests {in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>} to be more aware of the emotions and concerns of the American people," said the spokesman, <PERSON>Taizo Watanabe</PERSON>.
Fears that Japanese investors are buying up <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> have escalated sharply in the past several weeks, with <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's purchase of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Estate Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's acquisition of a 51% holding in <ORGANIZATION>Rockefeller Group</ORGANIZATION>, the owner of some of midtown <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>'s most exclusive real estate. 
Even before those moves added fuel, the fires of discontent had been well stoked by the highly publicized experience in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> of one <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> investor, <PERSON>T. Boone Pickens Jr</PERSON>.
The <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> oilman has acquired a 26.2% stake valued at more than $1.2 billion in an automotive-lighting company, <ORGANIZATION>Koito Manufacturing Co</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Koito</ORGANIZATION> has refused to grant <PERSON>Mr. Pickens</PERSON> seats on its board, asserting he is a greenmailer trying to pressure <ORGANIZATION>Koito</ORGANIZATION>'s other shareholders into buying him out at a profit. 
<PERSON>Mr. Pickens</PERSON> made considerable political hay with his troubles in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Senate Finance Committee</ORGANIZATION>, chaired by a fellow Texan, Democratic <PERSON>Sen. Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON>, last month urged <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON>Carla Hills</PERSON> to use <PERSON>Mr. Pickens</PERSON>'s experience in talks with <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> "to highlight this problem facing Americans who seek access to the Japanese capital markets." 
While <PERSON>Mr. Dallara</PERSON> and Japanese officials say the question of investors' access to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Japanese markets may get a disproportionate share of the public's attention, a number of other important economic issues will be on the table at next week's talks.
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> says it is anxious for results. "We feel very strongly that we really need action across the full range of issues we've identified, and we need it by next spring," <PERSON>Mr. Dallara</PERSON> says. 
After the first set of meetings two months ago, some <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials complained that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> hadn't come up with specific changes it was prepared to make.
Since then, a team of about 15 <ORGANIZATION>MITI</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> officials have crossed the globe gauging consumer prices.
<PERSON>J.P. Bolduc</PERSON>, vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION>W.R. Grace & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which holds a 83.4% interest in this energy-services company, was elected a director.
He succeeds <PERSON>Terrence D. Daniels</PERSON>, formerly a <ORGANIZATION>W.R. Grace</ORGANIZATION> vice chairman, who resigned.
<ORGANIZATION>W.R. Grace</ORGANIZATION> holds three of <ORGANIZATION>Grace Energy</ORGANIZATION>'s seven board seats. 
<ORGANIZATION>Montedison</ORGANIZATION> currently owns about 72% of <ORGANIZATION>Erbamont</ORGANIZATION>'s common shares outstanding. 
<ORGANIZATION>Texas Instruments Japan Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Instruments Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said it opened a plant in <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> to manufacture control devices. 
The new plant, located in <LOCATION>Chinchon</LOCATION> about 60 miles from <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>, will help meet increasing and diversifying demand for control products in <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>, the company said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Magna International Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's chief financial officer, <PERSON>James McAlpine</PERSON>, resigned and its chairman, <PERSON>Frank Stronach</PERSON>, is stepping in to help turn the automotive-parts manufacturer around, the company said. 
<PERSON>Mr. Stronach</PERSON> will direct an effort to reduce overhead and curb capital spending "until a more satisfactory level of profit is achieved and maintained," <ORGANIZATION>Magna</ORGANIZATION> said. 
<PERSON>Stephen Akerfeldt</PERSON>, currently vice president finance, will succeed <PERSON>Mr. McAlpine</PERSON>. 
On the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Magna</ORGANIZATION> shares closed up 37.5 Canadian cents to C$9.625. 
<PERSON>Mr. Stronach</PERSON>, founder and controlling shareholder of <ORGANIZATION>Magna</ORGANIZATION>, resigned as chief executive officer last year to seek, unsuccessfully, a seat in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>. 
The company said <PERSON>Mr. Stronach</PERSON> will personally direct the restructuring, assisted by <PERSON>Manfred Gingl</PERSON>, president and chief executive.
<ORGANIZATION>Magna</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Mr. McAlpine</PERSON> resigned to pursue a consulting career, with <PERSON>Magna</PERSON> as one of his clients. 
That can be a trap for unwary investors, says <PERSON>Richard Bernstein</PERSON>, senior quantitative analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co</ORGANIZATION>. Strong dividend growth, he says, is "the black widow of valuation" -- a reference to the female spiders that attract males and then kill them after mating. 
<PERSON>Stephen Boesel</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>T. Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund</ORGANIZATION>, explains that companies raise their payouts most robustly only after the economy and corporate profits have been growing for some time. "Invariably, those strong periods in the economy give way to recessionary environments," he says. "And recessionary environments aren't hospitable to the stock market." 
Payouts on the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 stocks rose 10% in 1988, according to <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor's Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, and Wall Street estimates for 1989 growth are generally between 9% and 14%.
A drop below that 3% benchmark "has always been a strong warning sign that stocks are fully valued," says <PERSON>Mr. Boesel</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>T. Rowe Price</ORGANIZATION>. 
There's never been an exception," says <PERSON>Gerald W. Perritt</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> investment adviser and money manager, based on a review of six decades of stock-market data. 
There have been only seven other times -- in 1929, 1933, 1961, 1965, 1968, 1971 and 1972 -- when the yield on the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 dropped below 3% for at least two consecutive months, <PERSON>Mr. Perritt</PERSON> found.
Still, some market analysts say the current 3.3% reading isn't as troublesome as it might have been in years past. "It's not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporations are not behaving in a traditional manner," says <PERSON>James H. Coxon</PERSON>, head of stock investments for <ORGANIZATION>Cigna Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the Philadelphia-based insurer. 
Rather than increasing dividends, some companies have used cash to buy back some of their shares, notes <PERSON>Steven G. Einhorn</PERSON>, co-chairman of the investment policy committee at <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, for instance, is forecasting growth in <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 dividends of just under 5% in 1990, down from an estimated 11% this year.
In other years in which there have been moderate economic slowdowns -- the environment the firm expects in 1990 -- the change in dividends ranged from a gain of 4% to a decline of 1% , according to <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON>Thomas Doerflinger</PERSON>. 
Dividend growth on the order of 12% is expected by both <PERSON>Mr. Coxon</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Cigna</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Mr. Einhorn</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Einhorn</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs</ORGANIZATION> estimates the stock market will deliver a 12% to 15% total return from appreciation and dividends over the next 12 months -- vs. a "cash rate of return" of perhaps 7% or 8% if dividend growth is weak. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Boesel</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>T. Rowe Price</ORGANIZATION>, who also expects 12% growth in dividends next year, doesn't think it will help the overall market all that much. "Having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook, but I don't think it's a main consideration," he says.
The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> voted to boost the federal minimum wage for the first time since early 1981, casting a solid 382-37 vote for a compromise measure backed by President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>. 
But the legislation reflected a compromise agreed to on Tuesday by President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and Democratic leaders in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, after congressional Republicans urged the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> to bend a bit from its previous resistance to compromise. 
"There are no smiles about this bill," Rep. <PERSON>Pat Williams</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Mont</LOCATION>.) said during <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> floor debate yesterday.
While the minimum wage had traditionally been pegged at half the average <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> manufacturing wage, the level of $4.25 an hour in 1991 will still be less than 35% of average factory pay, <PERSON>Mr. Williams</PERSON> said. 
But Rep. <PERSON>Marge Roukema</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>) instead praised the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>'s acceptance of a new youth "training" wage, a subminimum that <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> administrations have sought for many years.
<ORGANIZATION>R.P. Scherer Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it completed the $10.2 million sale of its <ORGANIZATION>Southern Optical</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary to a group led by the unit's president, <PERSON>Thomas R. Sloan</PERSON>, and other managers. 
Following the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>R.P. Scherer</ORGANIZATION> by a buy-out group led by <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton</ORGANIZATION> earlier this year, the maker of gelatin capsules decided to divest itself of certain of its non-encapsulating businesses.
Related to that decision, the company said it was converting its <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, factory to a research and development facility.
"This is a company that has invested in capacity additions more aggressively than any other company in the industry and now the industry is growing more slowly and they are suddenly poorly positioned," said <PERSON>Michael Stark</PERSON>, chip analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Robertson, Stephens & Co.</ORGANIZATION> "I think the stock is dead money for a while." Yesterday's announcement was made after markets closed. 
Your Oct. 6 article "<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s Financial Firms Lure Science Graduates" states, "Industrial companies are accusing financial institutions of jeopardizing <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s economy by raising the salary stakes for new employees." The Japanese industrial companies should know better.
<PERSON>Takuma Yamamoto</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Fujitsu Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, believes "the `money worship' among young people . . . caused the problem." He is just passing the buck to young people.
Separately, <PERSON>John Phelan</PERSON> told a closed <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee meeting in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> that he would support <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> halts of program trading during market emergencies.
The <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Merc</ORGANIZATION> said a new one-hour price limit would take effect in its <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor</ORGANIZATION>'s 500 stock-index futures pit once <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 futures fell 20 index points -- the equivalent of about a 150-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Late that afternoon the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 stock-index futures contract fell a total of 30 index points, hitting a <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> circuit breaker limit that remained in effect for the rest of the trading session. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> said that its existing 30-minute, 12-point limit on <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 stock-index futures trading (equal to about 100 points on the Dow Jones industrials), which was triggered Oct. 13, will remain in effect. 
<PERSON>Leo Melamed</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> executive committee chairman, said that the 12-point limit appeared to lessen the selling panic Oct. 13.
Several traders maintained that the <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION>'s 12-point circuit-breaker aggravated the market slide Oct. 13 by directing additional selling pressure to the floor of the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 
In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> aides said <PERSON>Mr. Phelan</PERSON> told congressmen that the collar, which banned program trades through the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s computer when the <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> Industrial Average moved 50 points, didn't work well.
In a post-hearing news conference, <PERSON>Mr. Phelan</PERSON>, who has publicly expressed concern about market volatility, said he told the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> finance and telecommunications subcommittee that he would support the program-trading halt proposal "providing the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> would be comfortable with the language" in a bill. 
The program-trading issue is heating up on <LOCATION>Capitol Hill</LOCATION> as it is on Wall Street, and several legislators want to grant the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> the power to shut off the programs when trading becomes too volatile.
<ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Richard Breeden</PERSON> has said he would be willing to consider circuit breakers that have preset trigger points, but he doesn't want discretionary power to stop programs. 
A <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> aide suggested that <PERSON>Mr. Phelan</PERSON> was so "vague and mushy" that it was the kind of meeting where people of all viewpoints could "come out feeling good." At one point, <PERSON>Mr. Phelan</PERSON> angered the subcommittee's chairman, Rep. <PERSON>Edward Markey</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>), by not going much beyond what already had been reported in the morning newspapers. 
At another point during the hearing, Rep. <PERSON>Markey</PERSON> asked <PERSON>Mr. Phelan</PERSON> what would be discussed at a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> exchange board meeting today.
<PERSON>Mr. Phelan</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> is likely to study the program-trading issue.
That response annoyed Rep. <PERSON>Markey</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> aides said, and the congressman snapped back that there had been enough studies of the issue and that it was time for action on the matter. 
Fifteen of the 26 subcommittee members attended the hearing, most notably Rep. <PERSON>John Dingell</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>), the full <ORGANIZATION>House Energy and Commerce Committee</ORGANIZATION> chairman, who has been willing to let <PERSON>Mr. Markey</PERSON> carry the legislation in recent months. 
But in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, where computer-driven trading now plays a small but growing role, traders say a number of hurdles loom. 
Government officials, especially in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, probably would resist any onslaught of program trading by players trying to shrug off the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> furor over their activities and marching abroad with their business.
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> is "very concerned" about the possible effects of program trading, a senior Japanese official said after the Oct. 13 stock plunge in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stock-index futures aren't even traded in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> now.
It all adds up to a barrier to American-style index arbitrage, the most popular form of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> program trading that seeks to exploit brief differences between prices of stocks in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and the price of a futures contract in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> based on those stocks. 
About 11.6% of all program trading by <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> firms in September took place in foreign markets, according to <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> data. 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Finance Ministry</ORGANIZATION> already is scrutinizing institutional investors' activity to see whether policy changes are needed to cope with the current level of program trading, said <PERSON>Makato Utsumi</PERSON>, vice minister for international finance. 
Program trading has taken off in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> since last year's introduction of home-market stock-index futures trading on the <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Osaka</LOCATION> stock exchanges.
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Finance Ministry</ORGANIZATION> had set up mechanisms to limit how far futures prices could fall in a single session and to give market operators the authority to suspend trading in futures at any time. "Maybe it wasn't enough," a <ORGANIZATION>Finance Ministry</ORGANIZATION> official noted after the Dec. 7 surge.
<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s leading program traders are the big <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> securities houses, though the Japanese are playing catch-up.
Some <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> firms, notably <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, have reaped a hefty chunk of their Japanese earnings from index arbitrage, both for customers and for their own accounts. (<ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley</ORGANIZATION> last week joined a growing list of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> securities firms that have stopped doing index arbitrage for their own accounts.) 
Both <PERSON>Deryck C. Maughan</PERSON>, who heads <ORGANIZATION>Salomon</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>John S. Wadsworth</PERSON>, who heads <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley</ORGANIZATION> there, ascribe a good part of their firms' success in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> to their ability to offer sophisticated, futures-related investment strategies to big institutional clients.
"It has not been disruptive in the markets here," <PERSON>Mr. Maughan</PERSON> said. "The real difference seems to be that the cash market here . . . is big enough and liquid enough that the futures market isn't having the same impact it does in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>." 
Index-arbitrage trading is "something we want to watch closely," an official at <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> said. "We don't think there is cause for concern at the moment." 
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> serves increasingly as a conduit for program trading of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stocks.
First, the trading is done over the counter and isn't reported on either the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> stock trading tapes.
Second, it can be used to unwind positions before <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trading begins, but at prices pegged to the previous session's <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> close.
Still, "Much less {index-arbitrage activity} is done over here than in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>" said <PERSON>Richard Barfield</PERSON>, chief investment manager at <ORGANIZATION>Standard Life Assurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which manages about #15 billion ($23.72 billion) in <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> institutional funds. 
A <ORGANIZATION>Financial Times-Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> 100-share index option contract is traded on the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Traded Options Market</ORGANIZATION>.
And an FT-SE futures contract is traded on the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>International Financial Futures Exchange</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Lancaster Colony Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it acquired <ORGANIZATION>Reames Foods Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in a cash transaction.
<ORGANIZATION>Reames</ORGANIZATION>, a maker and marketer of frozen noodles and pre-cooked pasta based in <LOCATION>Clive</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, has annual sales of about $11 million, <ORGANIZATION>Lancaster</ORGANIZATION> said. 
When it's time for their biannual powwow, the nation's manufacturing titans typically jet off to the sunny confines of resort towns like <LOCATION>Boca Raton</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hot Springs</LOCATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Manufacturers</ORGANIZATION> settled on the Hoosier capital of <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION> for its fall board meeting.
On the receiving end of the message were officials from giants like <ORGANIZATION>Du Pont</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Maytag</ORGANIZATION>, along with lesser knowns like <ORGANIZATION>Trojan Steel</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Valley Queen Cheese Factory</ORGANIZATION>. 
For starters, the executives joined Mayor <PERSON>William H. Hudnut III</PERSON> for an evening of the <ORGANIZATION>Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra</ORGANIZATION> and a guest pianist-comedian <PERSON>Victor Borge</PERSON>.

Rekindled hope that two <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> states will allow broader interstate banking boosted <ORGANIZATION>Nasdaq</ORGANIZATION>'s bank stocks, but the over-the-counter market was up only slightly in lackluster trading. 
The bank stocks got a boost when <ORGANIZATION>Connecticut Bank & Trust</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Bank of New England</ORGANIZATION> said they no longer oppose pending legislation that would permit banks from other regions to merge with <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> banks.
<ORGANIZATION>Bank of New England</ORGANIZATION>'s shares are traded on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 
But speculators, anticipating that <ORGANIZATION>Connecticut</ORGANIZATION> will approve a law permitting such interstate banking soon, immediately bid up shares of <ORGANIZATION>Connecticut</ORGANIZATION> banks on the news. "A lot of the stocks that have been under water finally saw a reason to uptick," said <PERSON>George Jennison</PERSON>, head trader of banking issues in <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>OTC</ORGANIZATION> department. 
The <LOCATION>Stamford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, concern has agreed to a buy-out by <ORGANIZATION>Bank of New York</ORGANIZATION> in a transaction with an indicated value of about $100 a share that expires next August.
<PERSON>Ed Macheski</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Wilton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, money manager who follows bank stocks, said the announcement effectively gives the deal "the green light." 
<PERSON>Mr. Jennison</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Northeast Bancorp</ORGANIZATION> also fared well because takeover stocks have returned to favor among investors.

<PERSON>Dan E. Nelms</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Valley Federal</ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer, said the one-time charge substantially eliminates future losses associated with the unit.
<ORGANIZATION>Weisfield</ORGANIZATION>'s surged 6 3/4 to 55 1/2 and <ORGANIZATION>Ratners Group</ORGANIZATION>'s American depositary receipts, or ADRs, gained 5/8 to 12 1/4.
The two concerns said they entered into a definitive merger agreement under which <ORGANIZATION>Ratners</ORGANIZATION> will begin a tender offer for all of <ORGANIZATION>Weisfield</ORGANIZATION>'s common shares for $57.50 each. 
After troubled <ORGANIZATION>Heritage Media</ORGANIZATION> proposed acquiring <ORGANIZATION>POP Radio</ORGANIZATION> in a stock swap, <ORGANIZATION>POP Radio</ORGANIZATION>'s shares tumbled 4 to 14 3/4.
<ORGANIZATION>Heritage Media</ORGANIZATION>, which already owns about 51% of <ORGANIZATION>POP Radio</ORGANIZATION>, proposed paying <ORGANIZATION>POP Radio</ORGANIZATION> shareholders with shares of a new class of <ORGANIZATION>Heritage Media</ORGANIZATION> preferred stock that would be convertible into four shares of <ORGANIZATION>Heritage Media</ORGANIZATION>'s common.

Department officials say that <ORGANIZATION>HHS</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Louis Sullivan</PERSON> will support <PERSON>Dr. Mason</PERSON>'s ruling, which will be issued soon in the form of a letter to the acting director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Institutes of Health</ORGANIZATION>.
Both <PERSON>Dr. Mason</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dr. Sullivan</PERSON> oppose federal funding for abortion, as does President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, except in cases where a woman's life is threatened. 
The controversy began in 1987 when the <ORGANIZATION>National Institutes of Health</ORGANIZATION>, aware of the policy implications of its research, asked for an <ORGANIZATION>HHS</ORGANIZATION> review of its plan to implant fetal tissue into the brain of a patient suffering from Parkinson's disease.
The dispute has hampered the administration's efforts to recruit prominent doctors to fill prestigious posts at the helm of the <ORGANIZATION>NIH</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Antonio Novello</PERSON>, whom <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> nominated to serve as surgeon general, reportedly has assured the administration that she opposes abortion.
<PERSON>Dr. Novello</PERSON> is deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</ORGANIZATION>. 
Earlier this week, <PERSON>Dr. Sullivan</PERSON> tried to defuse these charges by stressing that candidates to head the <ORGANIZATION>NIH</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> will be judged by "standards of scientific and administrative excellence," not politics. 
But the administration's handling of the fetal-tissue transplant issue disturbs many scientists. "When scientific progress moves into uncharted ground, there has to be a role for society to make judgments about its applications," says <PERSON>Myron Genel</PERSON>, associate dean of the <ORGANIZATION>Yale Medical School</ORGANIZATION>. "The disturbing thing about this abortion issue is that the debate has become polarized, so that no mechanism exists" for finding a middle ground. 
But <PERSON>Dr. Genel</PERSON> warns that <PERSON>Dr. Mason</PERSON>'s ruling may discourage private funding. "The unavailability of federal funds, and the climate in which the decision was made, certainly don't provide any incentive for one of the more visible foundations to provide support," he said. 
<ORGANIZATION>New England Electric System</ORGANIZATION> bowed out of the bidding for <ORGANIZATION>Public Service Co. of New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION>, saying that the risks were too high and the potential payoff too far in the future to justify a higher offer. 
The move leaves <ORGANIZATION>United Illuminating Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Northeast Utilities</ORGANIZATION> as the remaining outside bidders for <ORGANIZATION>PS of New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION>, which also has proposed an internal reorganization plan in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings under which it would remain an independent company. 
<ORGANIZATION>New England Electric</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Westborough</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, had offered $2 billion to acquire <ORGANIZATION>PS of New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION>, well below the $2.29 billion value <ORGANIZATION>United Illuminating</ORGANIZATION> places on its bid and the $2.25 billion <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> says its bid is worth.
<ORGANIZATION>United Illuminating</ORGANIZATION> is based in <LOCATION>New Haven</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> is based in <LOCATION>Hartford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>PS of New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Manchester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.H.</LOCATION>, values its internal reorganization plan at about $2.2 billion. 
<PERSON>John Rowe</PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>New England Electric</ORGANIZATION>, said the company's return on equity could suffer if it made a higher bid and its forecasts related to <ORGANIZATION>PS of New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION> -- such as growth in electricity demand and improved operating efficiencies -- didn't come true. "When we evaluated raising our bid, the risks seemed substantial and persistent over the next five years, and the rewards seemed a long way out.
<PERSON>Mr. Rowe</PERSON> also noted that political concerns also worried <ORGANIZATION>New England Electric</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Wilbur Ross Jr.</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Rothschild Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the financial adviser to the troubled company's equity holders, said the withdrawal of <ORGANIZATION>New England Electric</ORGANIZATION> might speed up the reorganization process.
The fact that <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> proposed lower rate increases -- 4.8% over seven years against around 5.5% boosts proposed by the other two outside bidders -- complicated negotiations with state officials, <PERSON>Mr. Ross</PERSON> asserted. "Now the field is less cluttered," he added. 
Separately, the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</ORGANIZATION> turned down for now a request by <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> seeking approval of its possible purchase of <ORGANIZATION>PS of New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> said it would refile its request and still hopes for an expedited review by the <ORGANIZATION>FERC</ORGANIZATION> so that it could complete the purchase by next summer if its bid is the one approved by the bankruptcy court. 
<ORGANIZATION>PS of New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION> shares closed yesterday at $3.75, off 25 cents, in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading. 
<ORGANIZATION>Hudson General Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's president and chief executive officer, <PERSON>Alan J. Stearn</PERSON>, resigned. 
<PERSON>Mr. Stearn</PERSON>, who had been with the company more than 20 years and had been president since 1984, will act as a consultant to <ORGANIZATION>Hudson General</ORGANIZATION>.
Investor <PERSON>Harold Simmons</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>NL Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> offered to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Gulf Corp.</ORGANIZATION> for $50 a share, or about $1.1 billion, stepping up the pressure on the commodity chemicals concern. 
The offer follows an earlier proposal by <ORGANIZATION>NL</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON> to help <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Gulf</ORGANIZATION> restructure or go private in a transaction that would pay shareholders $55 a share.
Late yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Gulf</ORGANIZATION> said it reviewed the <ORGANIZATION>NL</ORGANIZATION> proposal as well as interests from "third parties" regarding business combinations.
Analysts saw the latest offer as proof that <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON>, an aggressive and persistent investor, won't leave <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Gulf</ORGANIZATION> alone until some kind of transaction is completed. "He has clamped on their ankle like a pit bull," says <PERSON>Paul Leming</PERSON>, a vice president with <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley & Co.</ORGANIZATION> "He appears to be in it for the long haul." <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>NL</ORGANIZATION> already own a 9.9% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Gulf</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON> owns 88% of <ORGANIZATION>Valhi Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which in turn owns two-thirds of <ORGANIZATION>NL</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>NL</ORGANIZATION> is officially making the offer. 
<PERSON>Mr. Leming</PERSON> wasn't surprised by the lower price cited by <ORGANIZATION>NL</ORGANIZATION>, saying he believes that $55 a share is "the most you can pay for <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Gulf</ORGANIZATION> before it becomes a bad acquisition." 
<ORGANIZATION>Georgia Gulf</ORGANIZATION> stock rose $1.75 a share yesterday to close at $51.25 a share, while <ORGANIZATION>NL</ORGANIZATION> shares closed unchanged at $22.75 and <ORGANIZATION>Valhi</ORGANIZATION> rose 62.5 cents to $15, all in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading. 
<PERSON>J. Landis Martin</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>NL</ORGANIZATION> president and chief executive officer, said <ORGANIZATION>NL</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON> cut the price they were proposing for <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Gulf</ORGANIZATION> because they initially planned a transaction that included about $250 million in equity and a substantial amount of high-yield subordinated debt.
He also said that the group reduced its offer because it wasn't allowed to see <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Gulf</ORGANIZATION>'s confidential financial information without agreeing that it wouldn't make an offer unless it had <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Gulf</ORGANIZATION>'s consent. 
In a letter to <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Gulf</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Jerry R. Satrum</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Martin</PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Gulf</ORGANIZATION> to answer its offer by Tuesday. 
It wasn't clear how <ORGANIZATION>NL</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON> would respond if <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Gulf</ORGANIZATION> spurns them again.
<PERSON>Mr. Martin</PERSON> said they haven't yet decided what their next move would be, but he didn't rule out the possibility of a consent solicitation aimed at replacing <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Gulf</ORGANIZATION>'s board.
Although <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Gulf</ORGANIZATION> hasn't been eager to negotiate with <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>NL</ORGANIZATION>, a specialty chemicals concern, the group apparently believes the company's management is interested in some kind of transaction.
<ORGANIZATION>Fujitsu Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> 's top executive took the unusual step of publicly apologizing for his company's making bids of just one yen for several local government projects, while computer rival <ORGANIZATION>NEC Corp.</ORGANIZATION> made a written apology for indulging in the same practice. 
<ORGANIZATION>Fujitsu</ORGANIZATION> said it bid the equivalent of less than a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> penny on three separate municipal contracts during the past two years.
But <ORGANIZATION>Fujitsu</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s No. 1 computer maker, isn't alone.
In both cases, <ORGANIZATION>NEC</ORGANIZATION> lost the contract to <ORGANIZATION>Fujitsu</ORGANIZATION>, which made the same bid and won a tie-breaking lottery.
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Fair Trade Commission</ORGANIZATION> has said it is considering investigating the bids for possible antitrust-law violations. 
"We would like to apologize for having caused huge trouble," <ORGANIZATION>Fujitsu</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Takuma Yamamoto</PERSON>, read from a prepared statement as he stood before a packed news conference at his company's downtown headquarters.
<ORGANIZATION>NEC</ORGANIZATION> released a statement saying, "We feel sorry for having caused trouble to society," a form of apology common in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> for companies caught in embarrassing situations. 
But in one of the auctions in question, <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION> made a bid substantially higher than the <ORGANIZATION>Fujitsu</ORGANIZATION> offer, according to the municipality.
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government in recent years has accused Japanese companies of excessively slashing prices on semiconductors and supercomputers -- products <ORGANIZATION>Fujitsu</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NEC</ORGANIZATION> make. 
Asked whether the bidding flap would hurt <LOCATION>U.S.-Japan</LOCATION> relations, <PERSON>Mr. Yamamoto</PERSON> said, "this will be a minus factor." 
The "one-yen" controversy first came to a head last week when the city of <LOCATION>Hiroshima</LOCATION> announced that <ORGANIZATION>Fujitsu</ORGANIZATION> won a contract to design a computer system to map its waterworks.
Then Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION>Fujitsu</ORGANIZATION> said it made a similar bid to win a library contract in <LOCATION>Nagano</LOCATION> prefecture two weeks earlier.
It also said that in July, it bid 10,000 yen to design a system for the <ORGANIZATION>Saitama prefectural library</ORGANIZATION>, and two years ago, it bid one yen to plan the telecommunications system for <LOCATION>Wakayama</LOCATION> prefecture. 
The company said it has offered to withdraw its bids in <LOCATION>Hiroshima</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nagano</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Fujitsu</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NEC</ORGANIZATION> said they were still investigating, and that knowledge of more such bids could emerge.
"One yen is not ethical," <PERSON>Michio Sasaki</PERSON>, an official at <ORGANIZATION>Keidanren</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Japan Federation of Economic Organizations</ORGANIZATION>, said. "Profit may be low, but at least costs should be covered." 
The survival of spinoff <ORGANIZATION>Cray Computer Corp.</ORGANIZATION> as a fledgling in the supercomputer business appears to depend heavily on the creativity -- and longevity -- of its chairman and chief designer, <PERSON>Seymour Cray</PERSON>. 
Documents filed with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> on the pending spinoff disclosed that <ORGANIZATION>Cray Research Inc.</ORGANIZATION> will withdraw the almost $100 million in financing it is providing the new firm if <PERSON>Mr. Cray</PERSON> leaves or if the product-design project he heads is scrapped. 
"We didn't have much of a choice," <ORGANIZATION>Cray Computer</ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer, <PERSON>Gregory Barnum</PERSON>, said in an interview. "The theory is that <PERSON>Seymour</PERSON> is the chief designer of the Cray-3, and without him it could not be completed.
<ORGANIZATION>Cray Research</ORGANIZATION> did not want to fund a project that did not include <PERSON>Seymour</PERSON>." 
The filing on the details of the spinoff caused <ORGANIZATION>Cray Research</ORGANIZATION> stock to jump $2.875 yesterday to close at $38 in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading. 
Analysts noted yesterday that <ORGANIZATION>Cray Research</ORGANIZATION>'s decision to link its $98.3 million promissory note to <PERSON>Mr. Cray</PERSON>'s presence will complicate a valuation of the new company. "It has to be considered as an additional risk for the investor," said <PERSON>Gary P. Smaby</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Smaby Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>. "<ORGANIZATION>Cray Computer</ORGANIZATION> will be a concept stock," he said. "You either believe Seymour can do it again or you don't." 
<ORGANIZATION>Cray Computer</ORGANIZATION> also will face intense competition, not only from <ORGANIZATION>Cray Research</ORGANIZATION>, which has about 60% of the world-wide supercomputer market and which is expected to roll out the C-90 machine, a direct competitor with the Cray-3, in 1991.
The spinoff also will compete with <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s Big Three -- <ORGANIZATION>Hitachi Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>NEC Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Fujitsu Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 
Under terms of the spinoff, <ORGANIZATION>Cray Research</ORGANIZATION> stockholders are to receive one <ORGANIZATION>Cray Computer</ORGANIZATION> share for every two <ORGANIZATION>Cray Research</ORGANIZATION> shares they own in a distribution expected to occur in about two weeks.
Along with the note, <ORGANIZATION>Cray Research</ORGANIZATION> is transferring about $53 million in assets, primarily those related to the Cray-3 development, which has been a drain on <ORGANIZATION>Cray Research</ORGANIZATION>'s earnings. 
<PERSON>Mr. Cray</PERSON>, who couldn't be reached for comment, will work for the new <LOCATION>Colorado Springs</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, company as an independent contractor -- the arrangement he had with <ORGANIZATION>Cray Research</ORGANIZATION>.
Regarded as the father of the supercomputer, <PERSON>Mr. Cray</PERSON> was paid $600,000 at <ORGANIZATION>Cray Research</ORGANIZATION> last year.
<PERSON>Cray</PERSON> and <PERSON>Barnum</PERSON>, other senior management at the company includes <PERSON>Neil Davenport</PERSON>, 47, president and chief executive officer; <PERSON>Joseph M. Blanchard</PERSON>, 37, vice president, engineering; <PERSON>Malcolm A. Hammerton</PERSON>, 40, vice president, software; and <PERSON>Douglas R. Wheeland</PERSON>, 45, vice president, hardware.
She had seen cheating before, but these notes were uncanny. "A stockbroker is an example of a profession in trade and finance. . . . At the end of World War II, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> surrendered before <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. . . . <ORGANIZATION>The Senate-House conference committee</ORGANIZATION> is used when a bill is passed by the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> in different forms." 
<PERSON>Mrs. Yeargin</PERSON> was fired and prosecuted under an unusual <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> law that makes it a crime to breach test security.
The 1987 statute <PERSON>Mrs. Yeargin</PERSON> violated was designed to enforce provisions of <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>'s school-improvement laws.
"There is incredible pressure on school systems and teachers to raise test scores," says <PERSON>Walt Haney</PERSON>, an education professor and testing specialist at <ORGANIZATION>Boston College</ORGANIZATION>. "So efforts to beat the tests are also on the rise." And most disturbing, it is educators, not students, who are blamed for much of the wrongdoing. 
A 50-state study released in September by <ORGANIZATION>Friends for Education</ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION>Albuquerque</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.M.</LOCATION>, school-research group, concluded that "outright cheating by American educators" is "common." The group says standardized achievement test scores are greatly inflated because teachers often "teach the test" as <PERSON>Mrs. Yeargin</PERSON> did, although most are never caught. 
Use of Scoring High is widespread in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> and common in <LOCATION>Greenville County</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mrs. Yeargin</PERSON>'s school district. 
<ORGANIZATION>Friends of Education</ORGANIZATION> rates <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> one of the worst seven states in its study on academic cheating.
Says the organization's founder, <PERSON>John Cannell</PERSON>, prosecuting <PERSON>Mrs. Yeargin</PERSON> is "a way for administrators to protect themselves and look like they take cheating seriously, when in fact they don't take it seriously at all." 
<PERSON>Paul Sandifer</PERSON>, director of testing for the <ORGANIZATION>South Carolina department of education</ORGANIZATION>, says <PERSON>Mr. Cannell</PERSON>'s allegations of cheating "are purely without foundation," and based on unfair inferences.
<LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>'s reforms were designed for schools like <ORGANIZATION>Greenville High School</ORGANIZATION>.
Standing on a shaded hill in a run-down area of this old textile city, the school has educated many of <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>'s best and brightest, including the state's last two governors, Nobel Prize winning physicist <PERSON>Charles Townes</PERSON> and actress <PERSON>Joanne Woodward</PERSON>.
Another was <PERSON>Nancy Yeargin</PERSON>, who came to <LOCATION>Greenville</LOCATION> in 1985, full of the energy and ambitions that reformers wanted to reward. 
While <PERSON>Mrs. Ward</PERSON> fired and restructured staff and struggled to improve curriculum, <PERSON>Mrs. Yeargin</PERSON> worked 14-hour days and fast became a student favorite.
Encouraged by <PERSON>Mrs. Ward</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mrs. Yeargin</PERSON> taught honor students in the state "teacher cadet" program, a reform creation designed to encourage good students to consider teaching as a career.
"She was an inspirational lady; she had it all together," says <PERSON>Laura Dobson</PERSON>, a freshman at the <ORGANIZATION>University of South Carolina</ORGANIZATION> who had <PERSON>Mrs. Yeargin</PERSON> in the teacher-cadet class last year.
<PERSON>Mary Beth Marchand</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Greenville</LOCATION> 11th grader, also says <PERSON>Mrs. Yeargin</PERSON> inspired her to go into education. "She taught us more in Western Civilization than I've ever learned in other classes," says <PERSON>Kelli Green</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Greenville</LOCATION> senior. 
"She just never gave it up," says <PERSON>Mary Marchand</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mary Beth</PERSON>'s mother. "You'd see her correcting homework in the stands at a football game." 
<PERSON>Mary Elizabeth Ariail</PERSON>, another social-studies teacher, says she believed <PERSON>Mrs. Yeargin</PERSON> wanted to keep her standing high so she could get a new job that wouldn't demand good hearing.
Last March, after attending a teaching seminar in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mrs. Yeargin</PERSON> says she returned to <LOCATION>Greenville</LOCATION> two days before annual testing feeling that she hadn't prepared her low-ability geography students adequately.
<PERSON>Mrs. Yeargin</PERSON> says that she also wanted to help lift <ORGANIZATION>Greenville High School</ORGANIZATION>'s overall test scores, usually near the bottom of 14 district high schools in rankings carried annually by local newspapers.
They found students in an advanced class a year earlier who said she gave them similar help, although because the case wasn't tried in court, this evidence was never presented publicly. "That pretty much defeats any inkling that she was out to help the poor underprivileged child," says <PERSON>Joe Watson</PERSON>, the prosecutor in the case, who is also president of <ORGANIZATION>Greenville High School</ORGANIZATION>'s alumni association.
<PERSON>Mr. Watson</PERSON> says <PERSON>Mrs. Yeargin</PERSON> never complained to school officials that the standardized test was unfair. "Do I have much sympathy for her?" <PERSON>Mr. Watson</PERSON> asks. "Not really.
<PERSON>Mrs. Yeargin</PERSON> declined. "She said something like `You just want to make it easy for the school. ' I was dumbfounded," <PERSON>Mrs. Ward</PERSON> recalls. "It was like someone had turned a knife in me." 
Editorials in the <LOCATION>Greenville</LOCATION> newspaper allowed that <PERSON>Mrs. Yeargin</PERSON> was wrong, but also said the case showed how testing was being overused. 
Partly because of the show, <PERSON>Mr. Watson</PERSON> says, the district decided not to recommend <PERSON>Mrs. Yeargin</PERSON> for a first-time offenders program that could have expunged the charges and the conviction from her record.
At <ORGANIZATION>Greenville High School</ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, some students -- especially on the cheerleading squad -- were crushed. "It's hard to explain to a 17-year-old why someone they like had to go," says <PERSON>Mrs. Ward</PERSON>.
On the back, the shirts read, "We have all the answers." Many colleagues are angry at <PERSON>Mrs. Yeargin</PERSON>. "She did a lot of harm," says <PERSON>Cathryn Rice</PERSON>, who had discovered the crib notes. "We work damn hard at what we do for damn little pay, and what she did cast unfair aspersions on all of us." 
Despite the strong evidence against <PERSON>Mrs. Yeargin</PERSON>, popular sentiment was so strong in her favor, <PERSON>Mrs. Ward</PERSON> says, that "I'm afraid a jury wouldn't have convicted her." 
PAPERS: <ORGANIZATION>Backe Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> agreed to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Atlantic Publications Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which has 30 community papers and annual sales of $7 million.
<ORGANIZATION>Backe</ORGANIZATION> is a closely held media firm run by former <ORGANIZATION>CBS Inc</ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON>John Backe</PERSON>. 
TV: <ORGANIZATION>Price Communications Corp.</ORGANIZATION> completed the sale of four of its TV stations to <ORGANIZATION>NTG Inc.</ORGANIZATION> for $120 million in cash and notes, retaining a 10% equity stake in the new concern.
<ORGANIZATION>NTG</ORGANIZATION> was formed by <ORGANIZATION>Osborn Communications Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Desai Capital</ORGANIZATION>. 
It was <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON>'s first visit to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> in 1972 that set in motion the historic rapprochement between <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
But the former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> president's sixth visit to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, during which he spoke at length with Chinese leaders, was nowhere near as successful at easing strains that have recently afflicted the Sino-U.S. relationship. 
<PERSON>Mr. Nixon</PERSON>, the most prominent American to come to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> since <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>'s bloody suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators in June, harped on international outrage over the massacre.
One official newspaper, Legal Daily, even directly criticized <PERSON>Mr. Nixon</PERSON>, who is normally referred to here as an "old friend." The paper accused him of being a leading proponent of "peaceful evolution," a catch phrase to describe what <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> believes is the policy of Western countries to seduce socialist nations into the capitalist sphere. 
Instead, <PERSON>Mr. Nixon</PERSON> reminded his host, Chinese President <PERSON>Yang Shangkun</PERSON>, that Americans haven't forgiven <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s leaders for the military assault of June 3-4 that killed hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of demonstrators. 
"Many in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, including many friends of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, believe the crackdown was excessive and unjustified," <PERSON>Mr. Nixon</PERSON> told <PERSON>Mr. Yang</PERSON>, who was directly involved in ordering the attack. "The events of April through June damaged the respect and confidence which most Americans previously had for the leaders of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>." 
In talks with <PERSON>Mr. Nixon</PERSON>, Chinese leaders expressed no regret for the killings, and even suggested that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> was prominently involved in the demonstrations this spring.
In a meeting Tuesday, supreme leader, <PERSON>Deng Xiaoping</PERSON>, told <PERSON>Mr. Nixon</PERSON>, "Frankly speaking, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> was involved too deeply in the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion which occurred in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> not long ago.
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> was the real victim and it is unjust to reprove <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> for it." 
Despite the harsh exchanges, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> still seem to be looking for a way to mend relations, which have deteriorated into what <PERSON>Mr. Nixon</PERSON> referred to as "the greatest crisis in Chinese-American relations" since his initial visit to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 17 years ago.
In his return toast to <PERSON>Mr. Nixon</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Yang</PERSON> said the relationship had reached a "stalemate." 
Relations between <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> have been tense since June 7, when Chinese dissident <PERSON>Fang Lizhi</PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON>Li Shuxian</PERSON>, took refuge in the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>.
Shortly afterwards, <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> imposed a series of anti-China sanctions, including suspension of most high-level talks, which could be codified in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> congressional legislation in the coming weeks. 
<PERSON>Mr. Nixon</PERSON> is traveling in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> as a private citizen, but he has made clear that he is an unofficial envoy for the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration.
<PERSON>Mr. Nixon</PERSON> met <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> and his national security adviser, <PERSON>Brent Scowcroft</PERSON>, before coming to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> on Saturday.
<PERSON>Mr. Nixon</PERSON> was to leave <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> today. 
These included <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s economic policies, human rights and the question of <PERSON>Mr. Fang</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr. Nixon</PERSON> also proposed that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> restore its participation in the Fulbright Program, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government-funded academic exchange.
In his talks, the former president urged <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s leaders to acknowledge that their nation is part of the world community and welcome the infusion of outside contacts and ideas. "Ideas are going over borders, and there's no SDI ideological weapon that can shoot them down," he told a group of Americans at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. 
In a meeting with Premier <PERSON>Li Peng</PERSON> on Monday, <PERSON>Mr. Nixon</PERSON> said that he hoped he wouldn't encounter guards with machine guns during his visit to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Embassy. 
The purchases show the strong interest of Japanese investors in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> mortgage-based instruments, <ORGANIZATION>Fannie Mae</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, <PERSON>David O. Maxwell</PERSON>, said at a news conference.
The rest went to investors from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>. 
That fund was put together by <ORGANIZATION>Blackstone Group</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investment bank.
The latest two funds were assembled jointly by <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Daiwa Securities Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
By addressing those problems, <PERSON>Mr. Maxwell</PERSON> said, the new funds have become "extremely attractive to Japanese and other investors outside the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>" 
They also have become large purchasers of <ORGANIZATION>Fannie Mae</ORGANIZATION>'s corporate debt, buying $2.4 billion in <ORGANIZATION>Fannie Mae</ORGANIZATION> bonds during the first nine months of the year, or almost a tenth of the total amount issued. 
<ORGANIZATION>SHAREDATA Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it will amend a registration statement filed with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> to delete a plan to sell 500,000 newly issued common shares.
The <LOCATION>Chandler</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, company said it will resubmit the registration to cover only the 2.3 million warrants, each exercisable for the purchase of one common share.
<ORGANIZATION>Integra</ORGANIZATION>, which owns and operates hotels, said that <ORGANIZATION>Hallwood Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> has agreed to exercise any rights that aren't exercised by other shareholders.
<LOCATION>Hallwood</LOCATION>, a <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> merchant bank, owns about 11% of <ORGANIZATION>Integra</ORGANIZATION>. 
Oil production from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Bass Strait</LOCATION> fields will be raised by 11,000 barrels a day to about 321,000 barrels with the launch of the <LOCATION>Whiting</LOCATION> field, the first of five small fields scheduled to be brought into production before the end of 1990. 
<ORGANIZATION>Esso Australia Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of New York-based <ORGANIZATION>Exxon Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Broken Hill Pty.</ORGANIZATION> operate the fields in a joint venture. 
<ORGANIZATION>Esso</ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION>Whiting</LOCATION> field started production Tuesday.
The <LOCATION>Perch</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Dolphin</LOCATION> fields are expected to start producing early next year, and the <LOCATION>Seahorse</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tarwhine</LOCATION> fields later next year.
<PERSON>Kenneth Mayland</PERSON>, economist for <ORGANIZATION>Society Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> bank, said demand for exports of factory goods is beginning to taper off.
"This conforms to the `soft landing' scenario," said <PERSON>Elliott Platt</PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.</ORGANIZATION> "I don't see any signs that inventories are excessive." A soft landing is an economic slowdown that eases inflation without leading to a recession. 
<PERSON>David Berson</PERSON>, economist for the <ORGANIZATION>Mortgage Bankers Association</ORGANIZATION>, predicted the drop in interest rates eventually will boost spending on single-family homes, but probably not until early next year. 
The government's construction spending figures contrast with a report issued earlier in the week by <ORGANIZATION>McGraw-Hill Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>F.W. Dodge Group</ORGANIZATION>.
Although the purchasing managers' index continues to indicate a slowing economy, it isn't signaling an imminent recession, said <PERSON>Robert Bretz</PERSON>, chairman of the association's survey committee and director of materials management at <ORGANIZATION>Pitney Bowes Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Stamford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Pamela Sebastian</PERSON> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> contributed to this article. 
<ORGANIZATION>Furukawa Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> said it will acquire two construction machinery plants and a sales unit in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> formerly belonging to <ORGANIZATION>Dresser Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
Last October, the company also bought a wheel-loader manufacturing plant in <LOCATION>Heidelberg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, from <ORGANIZATION>Dresser</ORGANIZATION>. 
As an actor, <PERSON>Charles Lane</PERSON> isn't the inheritor of <PERSON>Charlie Chaplin</PERSON>'s spirit.
But it is <PERSON>Mr. Lane</PERSON>, as movie director, producer and writer, who has been obsessed with refitting <PERSON>Chaplin</PERSON>'s Little Tramp in a contemporary way.
In 1976, as a film student at the <LOCATION>Purchase</LOCATION> campus of the <ORGANIZATION>State University of New York</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Lane</PERSON> shot "A Place in Time," a 36-minute black-and-white film about a sketch artist, a man of the streets.
Composer <PERSON>Marc Marder</PERSON>, a college friend of <PERSON>Mr. Lane</PERSON>'s who earns his living playing the double bass in classical music ensembles, has prepared an exciting, eclectic score that tells you what the characters are thinking and feeling far more precisely than intertitles, or even words, would. 
Much of <PERSON>Mr. Lane</PERSON>'s film takes a highly romanticized view of life on the streets (though probably no more romanticized than <PERSON>Mr. Chaplin</PERSON>'s notion of the Tramp as the good-hearted free spirit).
Filmed in lovely black and white by <PERSON>Bill Dill</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> streets of "Sidewalk Stories" seem benign.
Yet this woman, <PERSON>Marie-Louise Giraud</PERSON>, carries historical significance, both as one of the last women to be executed in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and as a symbol of the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> government's hypocrisy.
As presented by <PERSON>Mr. Chabrol</PERSON>, and played with thin-lipped intensity by <PERSON>Isabelle Huppert</PERSON>, <PERSON>Marie-Louise</PERSON> (called <PERSON>Marie Latour</PERSON> in the film) was not a nice person.

Some media experts question whether a young magazine can risk turning off Madison Avenue's big spenders. "You really need the <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Soups</ORGANIZATION> of the world to be interested in your magazine if you're going to make a run of it," says <PERSON>Mike White</PERSON>, senior vice president and media director at <ORGANIZATION>DDB Needham</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. "The economics of magazine publishing pretty much require that you have a pretty solid base" of big-time ad spenders, he adds. 
The first two issues featured ads from only a handful of big advertisers, including <ORGANIZATION>General Electric</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Adolph Coors</ORGANIZATION>, but the majority were from companies like <ORGANIZATION>Waste Management Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Bumkins International</ORGANIZATION>, firms that don't spend much money advertising and can't be relied on to support a magazine over the long haul. 
According to <PERSON>Ms. Poore</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Old-House Journal Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, her publishing company, printed and sold all 126,000 copies of the premiere issue.
<ORGANIZATION>INTERPUBLIC</ORGANIZATION> ON TV: <ORGANIZATION>Interpublic Group</ORGANIZATION> said its television programming operations -- which it expanded earlier this year -- agreed to supply more than 4,000 hours of original programming across <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> in 1990.
It said the programs, largely game shows, will be provided by its <ORGANIZATION>E.C. Television</ORGANIZATION> unit along with <ORGANIZATION>Fremantle International</ORGANIZATION>, a producer and distributor of game shows of which it recently bought 49%.

<PERSON>Mr. Baris</PERSON> is a lawyer in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
While worry grows about big Japanese investments in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s big trading companies are rapidly increasing their stake in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s smaller business. 
Take the deal with <ORGANIZATION>Candela Laser Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Wayland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, manufacturer of high-tech medical devices, which three years ago set its sights on <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> as an export market.
Partly to help clear the myriad obstacles facing any overseas company trying to penetrate <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, tiny <ORGANIZATION>Candela</ORGANIZATION> turned to <ORGANIZATION>Mitsui & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s largest trading companies, for investment. 
In a joint-venture deal, <ORGANIZATION>Mitsui</ORGANIZATION> guided <ORGANIZATION>Candela</ORGANIZATION> through <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s bureaucratic maze.
It eventually secured <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Health</ORGANIZATION> import approval for two <ORGANIZATION>Candela</ORGANIZATION> laser products -- one that breaks up kidney stones and another that treats skin lesions.
At last count, <ORGANIZATION>Candela</ORGANIZATION> had sold $4 million of its medical devices in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
The deal also gave <ORGANIZATION>Mitsui</ORGANIZATION> access to a high-tech medical product. "They view this as a growth area so they went about it with a systematic approach," says <PERSON>Richard Olsen</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Candela</ORGANIZATION> vice president.
In the first half of 1989 alone, Japanese corporations invested $214 million in minority positions in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies, a 61% rise from the figure for all of 1987, reports <ORGANIZATION>Venture Economics Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
The <LOCATION>Needham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, concern tracks investments in new businesses.
Heightened Japanese interest in American small business parallels an acceleration of investments giving Japanese companies control of large, highly visible <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> corporations, such as <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc</ORGANIZATION>. Only this week, it was announced that <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Estate Co.</ORGANIZATION> had acquired a 51% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Rockefeller Group</ORGANIZATION>, which owns <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s prestigious Rockefeller Center. 
<ORGANIZATION>Free State Glass Industries</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Warrenton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, a small fabricator of architectural glass, was foundering under its original management.
Last year, <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi International Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the New York-based arm of <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, bought controlling interest in the glass company in a joint venture with <PERSON>Ronald Bodner</PERSON>, a glass industry executive and <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi</ORGANIZATION> consultant. 
The deal is chiefly designed to give <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi</ORGANIZATION> a window on the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> glass industry, says <PERSON>Ichiro Wakui</PERSON>, an executive in <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi</ORGANIZATION>'s general merchandise department in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. "It's not just a simple investment in a small company," <PERSON>Mr. Wakui</PERSON> says. "We want to see the glass market from the inside, not the outside." 
<ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi</ORGANIZATION>'s investment in <ORGANIZATION>Free State</ORGANIZATION> is "very small . . . less than $4 million," <PERSON>Mr. Wakui</PERSON> says.
Trading companies such as <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Mitsui</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>C. Itoh & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Nissho-Iwai Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which make many of the Japanese investments in small <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> concerns, have no <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> counterpart.
"All the "sogo-shosha" are looking for new business," says <PERSON>Arthur Klauser</PERSON>, adviser to the president of <ORGANIZATION>Mitsui, U.S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, using the Japanese term for the largest of the global trading houses. 
Adds <PERSON>Takeshi Kondo</PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION>C. Itoh America Inc.</ORGANIZATION>: "We have a great interest in making investments, particularly in new ventures." 
A host of electronics firms in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Silicon Valley</LOCATION> were financed with trading-company venture capital.
In investing on the basis of future transactions, a role often performed by merchant banks, trading companies can cut through the logjam that small-company owners often face with their local commercial banks. "It's the classic problem of the small businessman," says <PERSON>Malcolm Davies</PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION>Trading Alliance Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. "People are queuing at the door to take his product but he doesn't have the working capital to make the thing and commercial banks are very unsympathetic.
Adds <ORGANIZATION>Mitsui</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Klauser</PERSON>: "Unlike corporations in this country, trading companies aren't so much interested in a high return on investment as they are on increasing trade flows.
<PERSON>Mr. Klauser</PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION>Mitsui</ORGANIZATION> has 75 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> subsidiaries in which it holds 35% interest or more and the trading company hopes to double the number of its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> affiliates in 1990.
The multilevel railcars, scheduled for delivery in 1990, will be made by <ORGANIZATION>Thrall Manufacturing Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Chicago Heights</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, division of closely held <ORGANIZATION>Duchossois Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Elmhurst</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill</LOCATION>.
Lead underwriters for the issue are <ORGANIZATION>Scotia McLeod Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>RBC Dominion Securities Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, both Toronto-based investment dealers.
"This form forces a lawyer to become, in effect, a witness against his client," said <PERSON>Neal R. Sonnett</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers</ORGANIZATION>. "The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> is asking lawyers to red-flag a criminal problem to the government," added <PERSON>Mr. Sonnett</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> lawyer who has heard from dozens of attorneys who received letters in recent days and has himself received the computer-generated <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> forms sent by certified mail. 
The defense lawyers' group formed a task force this week, chaired by <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> attorney <PERSON>Gerald Lefcourt</PERSON>, to deal with the matter. 
The <ORGANIZATION>American Bar Association's House of Delegates</ORGANIZATION> passed a resolution in 1985 condemning the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> reporting requirement.
<PERSON>Michael Ross</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> lawyer who heads the <ORGANIZATION>ABA</ORGANIZATION>'s grand jury committee, said that lawyers are prohibited by the <ORGANIZATION>ABA</ORGANIZATION>'s code of ethics from disclosing information about a client except where a court orders it or to prevent the client from committing a criminal act that could result in death. 
<PERSON>Mr. Ross</PERSON> said he met with officials of the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>, which would bring any enforcement actions against taxpayers, to discuss the issue last May.
<PERSON>Mr. Ross</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> officials opposed the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>'s moderate stance on the matter. 
But in the letters sent in recent days, <PERSON>Christopher J. Lezovich</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> computing center in <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, told attorneys that "failing to voluntarily submit the requested information could result in summons enforcement action being initiated." In some cases, the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> asked for information dating back to forms it received in 1985. 
Individuals familiar with the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>'s policy said that <ORGANIZATION>Justice</ORGANIZATION> officials hadn't any knowledge of the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>'s actions in the last week. 
Often, judges ease into more lucrative private practice with little fanfare, but not federal <PERSON>Judge Raul A. Ramirez</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
At his new job, as partner in charge of federal litigation in the <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION>Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe</ORGANIZATION>, he will make out much better. 
Cartoonist <PERSON>Garry Trudeau</PERSON> is suing the <ORGANIZATION>Writers Guild of America East</ORGANIZATION> for $11 million, alleging it mounted a "campaign to harass and punish" him for crossing a screenwriters' picket line. 
The dispute involves <ORGANIZATION>Darkhorse Productions Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a TV production company in which <PERSON>Mr. Trudeau</PERSON> is a co-owner.
<PERSON>Mr. Trudeau</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Writers Guild</ORGANIZATION> member, also was employed as a writer for <ORGANIZATION>Darkhorse</ORGANIZATION>, which was covered by a guild collective-bargaining agreement. 
In his lawsuit, <PERSON>Mr. Trudeau</PERSON> says the strike illegally included <ORGANIZATION>Darkhorse</ORGANIZATION>, and the cartoonist refused to honor the strike against the company.
<PERSON>Mr. Trudeau</PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON>Norman K. Samnick</PERSON>, said the harassment consists mainly of the guild's year-long threats of disciplinary action.
<PERSON>Mr. Samnick</PERSON> said a guild disciplinary hearing is scheduled next Monday in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
The rule also prohibits funding for activities that "encourage, promote or advocate abortion." Title X funds are the single largest source of federal funding for family-planning services, according to the opinion by the <ORGANIZATION>Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Jack Hampton</PERSON> had sparked calls for a judicial inquiry with his remarks to the press last December, two weeks after sentencing an 18-year-old defendant to 30 years in state prison for killing two homosexual men in a city park.
But <PERSON>Robert R. Murray</PERSON>, a special master appointed by the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Judge Hampton</PERSON> didn't breach any judicial standards of fairness, although he did violate the state's judicial code by commenting publicly on a pending case.
<PERSON>Mr. Murray</PERSON> also said <PERSON>Judge Hampton</PERSON>'s comments didn't discredit the judiciary or the administration of justice. 
Attorneys in the third stock-manipulation trial of <ORGANIZATION>GAF Corp.</ORGANIZATION> began opening arguments yesterday in the <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> courtroom of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Mary Johnson Lowe</PERSON>.
In an eight-count indictment, the government has charged <ORGANIZATION>GAF</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Wayne</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, specialty chemical maker, and its Vice Chairman <PERSON>James T. Sherwin</PERSON> with attempting to manipulate the common stock of <ORGANIZATION>Union Carbide Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in advance of <ORGANIZATION>GAF</ORGANIZATION>'s planned sale of a large block of the stock in November 1986.
SWITCHING TO THE DEFENSE: A former member of the prosecution team in the Iran/Contra affair joined the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> firm of <ORGANIZATION>Mayer, Brown & Platt</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Michael R. Bromwich</PERSON>, a member since January 1987 of the three-lawyer trial team in the prosecution of <PERSON>Oliver North</PERSON>, became a partner in the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, office of the 520-lawyer firm.
<PERSON>Mr. Bromwich</PERSON>, 35, also has served as deputy chief and chief of the narcotics unit for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney's office for the <ORGANIZATION>Southern District of New York</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>. 
But in August, <ORGANIZATION>First Atlanta National Bank</ORGANIZATION> introduced its Crown Account, a package designed to lure customers such as <PERSON>Ms. Driskill</PERSON>.
"You're dead in the water if you aren't segmenting the market," says <PERSON>Anne Moore</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Synergistics Research Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a bank consulting firm in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>NCNB Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, recently introduced its Financial Connections Program aimed at young adults just starting careers.
In September, <ORGANIZATION>Union Planters Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, launched The Edge account, a package designed for the "thirtysomething" crowd with services that include a credit card and line of credit with no annual fees, and a full percentage point off on installment loans.
<PERSON>Judie MacDonald</PERSON>, vice president of retail sales at <ORGANIZATION>Barnett Banks Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Jacksonville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, says the company now targets sub-segments within the market by tailoring its popular Seniors Partners Program to various life styles. 
She says individual <ORGANIZATION>Barnett</ORGANIZATION> branches can add different benefits to their Seniors Partners package -- such as athletic activities or travel clubs -- to appeal to local market interests. "An active 55-year-old in <LOCATION>Boca Raton</LOCATION> may care more about Senior Olympic games, while a 75-year-old in <LOCATION>Panama City</LOCATION> may care more about a seminar on health," she says. 
In 1973, <ORGANIZATION>Wells Fargo & Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> launched the Gold Account, which included free checking, a credit card, safe-deposit box and travelers checks for a $3 monthly fee. 
The competition has grown more intense as bigger banks such as <ORGANIZATION>Norwest Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Chemical Banking Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> extend their market-share battles into small towns across the nation. "Today, a banker is worrying about local, regional and money-center {banks}, as well as thrifts and credit unions," says <PERSON>Ms. Moore</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Synergistics Research</ORGANIZATION>. "So people who weren't even thinking about targeting 10 years ago are scrambling to define their customer base." 
The competition has cultivated a much savvier consumer. "The average household will spread 19 accounts over a dozen financial institutions," says <PERSON>Michael P. Sullivan</PERSON>, who runs his own bank consulting firm in <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION> "This much fragmentation makes attracting and keeping today's rate-sensitive customers costly." 
<ORGANIZATION>Chemical Bank</ORGANIZATION> spent more than $50 million to introduce its ChemPlus line, several packages aimed at different segments, in 1986, according to <PERSON>Thomas Jacob</PERSON>, senior vice president of marketing. "It's not easy to roll out something that comprehensive, and make it pay," <PERSON>Mr. Jacob</PERSON> says. 
Some banks are already moving in that direction, according to <PERSON>Alvin T. Sale</PERSON>, marketing director at <ORGANIZATION>First Union Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>.
While market sentiment remains cautiously bearish on the dollar based on sluggish <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economic indicators, dealers note that Japanese demand has helped underpin the dollar against the yen and has kept the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> currency from plunging below key levels against the mark. 
<PERSON>Jay Goldinger</PERSON>, with <ORGANIZATION>Capital Insight Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, reasons that while the mark has posted significant gains against the yen as well -- the mark climbed to 77.70 yen from 77.56 yen late Tuesday in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> -- the strength of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> bond market compared to its foreign counterparts has helped lure investors to dollar-denominated bonds, rather than mark bonds. 
"Dollar-yen {trade} is the driving force in the market," said <PERSON>Tom Trettien</PERSON>, a vice president with <ORGANIZATION>Banque Paribas</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, "but I'm not convinced it will continue.
In <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Thursday, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> currency opened for trading at 143.93 yen, up from Wednesday's <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> close of 143.08 yen. 
<PERSON>Douglas Madison</PERSON>, a corporate trader with <ORGANIZATION>Bank of America</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, traced the dollar's recent solid performance against the yen to purchases of securities by Japanese insurance companies and trust banks and the sense that another wave of investment is waiting in the wings. 
He contends that the perception in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> of a vitriolic <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> response to <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's announcement of its purchase of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ORGANIZATION> has been temporarily mollified.
He cites the recent deal between the <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Estate Co.</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Rockefeller Group</ORGANIZATION>, as well as the possible white knight role of an undisclosed Japanese company in the <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION>Great Northern Nekoosa Corp.</ORGANIZATION> as evidence. 
Meanwhile, traders in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> say that the prospect of lower <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> interest rates has spurred dollar buying by Japanese institutions. 
They point out that these institutions want to lock in returns on high-yield <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Treasury</ORGANIZATION> debt and suggest demand for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unit will continue unabated until rates in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> recede. 
The market again showed little interest in further evidence of a slowing <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economy, and traders note that the market in recent weeks has taken its cues more from Wall Street than <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economic indicators. 
On the <ORGANIZATION>Commodity Exchange</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, gold for current delivery settled at $374.20 an ounce, down 50 cents.
<LOCATION>ASLACTON</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> -- Of all scenes that evoke rural <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, this is one of the loveliest: An ancient stone church stands amid the fields, the sound of bells cascading from its tower, calling the faithful to evensong. 
Like most of the other 6,000 churches in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> with sets of bells, <ORGANIZATION>St. Michael</ORGANIZATION> once had its own "band" of ringers, who would herald every Sunday morning and evening service.
<PERSON>Mr. Hammond</PERSON> worries that old age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the ranks of the East Anglian group that keeps the <LOCATION>Aslacton</LOCATION> bells pealing.
A look at a Thursday night practice at <ORGANIZATION>St. Mary Abbot church</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>Kensington district</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> gives an idea of the work involved.
"Ringing does become a bit of an obsession," admits <PERSON>Stephanie Pattenden</PERSON>, master of the band at <ORGANIZATION>St. Mary Abbot</ORGANIZATION> and one of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s best female ringers. 
Two years ago, the Rev. <PERSON>Jeremy Hummerstone</PERSON>, vicar of <LOCATION>Great Torrington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Devon</LOCATION>, got so fed up with ringers who didn't attend service he sacked the entire band; the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest. "They were a self-perpetuating club that treated the tower as sort of a separate premises," the Vicar <PERSON>Hummerstone</PERSON> says. 
At <ORGANIZATION>St. Mary's Church</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Ilminster</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Somerset</LOCATION>, the bells have fallen silent following a dust-up over church attendance.
The vicar, <PERSON>W.D. Jones</PERSON>, refuses to talk about it, saying it would "reopen the wound." But <PERSON>C.J.B. Marshall</PERSON>, vicar of a nearby church, feels the fault is in the stairs from the bell tower that are located next to the altar. "So crunch, crunch, crunch, bang, bang, bang -- here come the ringers from above, making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer," he says. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Central Council of Church Bell Ringers</ORGANIZATION>, a sort of parliament of ringing groups, aims to improve relations with vicars, says <PERSON>John C. Baldwin</PERSON>, president.
The oldest bell-ringing group in the country, the <ORGANIZATION>Ancient Society of College Youths</ORGANIZATION>, founded in 1637, remains male-only, a fact that's particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s most prestigious churches, <ORGANIZATION>St. Paul's Cathedral</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Westminster Abbey</ORGANIZATION>. 
In the torrent of replies that followed, one woman ringer from <LOCATION>Solihull</LOCATION> observed that "the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be desired: badly dressed, decorated with acne and a large beer-belly, frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals." Another women wrote from <LOCATION>Sheffield</LOCATION> to say that in her 60 years of ringing, "I have never known a lady to faint in the belfry.
Judging from the Americana in <PERSON>Haruki Murakami</PERSON>'s "A Wild Sheep Chase" (<ORGANIZATION>Kodansha</ORGANIZATION>, 320 pages, $18.95), baby boomers on both sides of the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> have a lot in common.
They read <PERSON>Mickey Spillane</PERSON> and talk about <PERSON>Groucho</PERSON> and <PERSON>Harpo</PERSON>.
The 40-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Murakami</PERSON> is a publishing sensation in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
But he is just one of several youthful writers -- <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s brat pack -- who are dominating the best-seller charts in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
In <PERSON>Robert Whiting</PERSON>'s "You Gotta Have Wa" (<ORGANIZATION>Macmillan</ORGANIZATION>, 339 pages, $17.95), the Beatles give way to baseball, in the Nipponese version we would be hard put to call a "game." As <PERSON>Mr. Whiting</PERSON> describes it, Nipponese baseball is a "mirror of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s fabled virtues of hard work and harmony." "Wa" is Japanese for "team spirit" and Japanese ballplayers have miles and miles of it.
Polls once named <ORGANIZATION>Tokyo Giants</ORGANIZATION> star <PERSON>Tatsunori Hara</PERSON>, a "humble, uncomplaining, obedient soul," as the male symbol of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
"Funny Business" (<ORGANIZATION>Soho</ORGANIZATION>, 228 pages, $17.95) by <PERSON>Gary Katzenstein</PERSON> is anything but.
It's the petulant complaint of an impudent American whom <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> hosted for a year while he was on a Luce Fellowship in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> -- to the regret of both parties. 
In sometimes amusing, more often supercilious, even vicious passages, <PERSON>Mr. Katzenstein</PERSON> describes how <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> invades even the most mundane aspects of its workers' lives -- at the regimented office, where employees are assigned lunch partners -- and at "home" in the austere company dormitory run by a prying caretaker. 
All of this must have been enormously frustrating to <PERSON>Mr. Katzenstein</PERSON>, who went to <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> with degrees in business and computer science and was raring to invent another Walkman. 
But <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> ultimately took a lesson from the American management books and fired <PERSON>Mr. Katzenstein</PERSON>, after he committed the social crime of making an appointment to see the venerable <PERSON>Akio Morita</PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Katzenstein</PERSON> certainly would have learned something, and it's even possible <PERSON>Mr. Morita</PERSON> would have too. 
<PERSON>Ms. Kirkpatrick</PERSON>, the Journal's deputy editorial features editor, worked in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> for three years. 
In <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Siti Zaharah Sulaiman</PERSON>, a deputy minister in the prime minister's office, launched a "No-Smoking Week" at the <ORGANIZATION>Mara Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION>Kuala Lumpur</LOCATION> and urged other schools to ban on-campus smoking. 
The study by the <ORGANIZATION>Backer Spielvogel Bates</ORGANIZATION> ad agency also found that the colony's consumers feel more pressured than those in any of the other surveyed markets, which include the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
The survey found that nearly half of <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> consumers espouse what it identified as materialistic values, compared with about one-third in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
More than three in five said they are under a great deal of stress most of the time, compared with less than one in two <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> consumers and one in four in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.

In happier news, <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>, in establishing diplomatic ties with <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> yesterday, announced $450 million in loans to the financially strapped <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION> government. 
In a victory for environmentalists, <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>'s parliament terminated a multibillion-dollar <LOCATION>River Danube</LOCATION> dam being built by Austrian firms. 
In ending <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>'s part of the project, Parliament authorized Prime Minister <PERSON>Miklos Nemeth</PERSON> to modify a 1977 agreement with <LOCATION>Czechoslovakia</LOCATION>, which still wants the dam to be built. 
<PERSON>Mr. Nemeth</PERSON> said in parliament that <LOCATION>Czechoslovakia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> would suffer environmental damage if the twin dams were built as planned. 
<LOCATION>Czechoslovakia</LOCATION> said in May it could seek $2 billion from <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> if the twindam contract were broken.
A painting by <PERSON>August Strindberg</PERSON> set a Scandinavian price record when it sold at auction in <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION> for $2.44 million. "Lighthouse II" was painted in oils by the playwright in 1901 . . . After years of decline, weddings in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> showed a 2.2% upturn last year, with 6,000 more couples exchanging rings in 1988 than in the previous year, the national statistics office said.
<ORGANIZATION>Copperweld Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a specialty steelmaker, said 445 workers at a plant in <LOCATION>Shelby</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, began a strike after the <ORGANIZATION>United Steelworkers Local 3057</ORGANIZATION> rejected a new contract on Tuesday. 
The previous contract between <ORGANIZATION>Copperweld</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ohio Steel Tube</ORGANIZATION> division and the union expired at midnight Tuesday.
The protracted downturn reflects the intensity of <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Japan</ORGANIZATION> yen-support intervention since June, when the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> currency temporarily surged above the 150.00 yen level. 
<PERSON>Norman Ricken</PERSON>, 52 years old and former president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION>Toys "R" Us Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Frederick Deane Jr.</PERSON>, 63, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Signet Banking Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, were elected directors of this consumer electronics and appliances retailing chain.
They succeed <PERSON>Daniel M. Rexinger</PERSON>, retired <ORGANIZATION>Circuit City</ORGANIZATION> executive vice president, and <PERSON>Robert R. Glauber</PERSON>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Treasury undersecretary, on the 12-member board. 
<ORGANIZATION>Sea Containers</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Hamilton</LOCATION>, Bermuda-based shipping concern, said Tuesday that it would sell $1.1 billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about 50% of its common shares for $70 apiece. 
The move is designed to ward off a hostile takeover attempt by two European shipping concerns, <ORGANIZATION>Stena Holding AG</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Tiphook PLC</ORGANIZATION>.
In May, the two companies, through their jointly owned holding company, <ORGANIZATION>Temple</ORGANIZATION>, offered $50 a share, or $777 million, for <ORGANIZATION>Sea Containers</ORGANIZATION>.
Yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Sea Containers</ORGANIZATION>' chief executive officer, <PERSON>James Sherwood</PERSON>, said in an interview that, under the asset-sale plan, <ORGANIZATION>Sea Containers</ORGANIZATION> would end up with a cash surplus of approximately $620 million.
That $130 million, <PERSON>Mr. Sherwood</PERSON> said, "gives us some flexibility in case <ORGANIZATION>Temple</ORGANIZATION> raises its bid.
<PERSON>Mr. Sherwood</PERSON> speculated that the leeway that <ORGANIZATION>Sea Containers</ORGANIZATION> has means that <ORGANIZATION>Temple</ORGANIZATION> would have to "substantially increase their bid if they're going to top us." 
<ORGANIZATION>Temple</ORGANIZATION>, however, harshly criticized <ORGANIZATION>Sea Containers</ORGANIZATION>' plan yesterday, characterizing it as a "highly conditional device designed to entrench management, confuse shareholders and prevent them from accepting our superior cash offer." 
A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Temple</ORGANIZATION> estimated that <ORGANIZATION>Sea Containers</ORGANIZATION>' plan -- if all the asset sales materialize -- would result in shareholders receiving only $36 to $45 a share in cash.
<ORGANIZATION>Temple</ORGANIZATION> added that <ORGANIZATION>Sea Containers</ORGANIZATION> is still mired in legal problems in <LOCATION>Bermuda</LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> has temporarily barred <ORGANIZATION>Sea Containers</ORGANIZATION> from buying back its own stock in a case brought by <ORGANIZATION>Stena</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Tiphook</ORGANIZATION>. {The court has indicated it will rule on the case by the end of the month.} 
<ORGANIZATION>Temple</ORGANIZATION> also said <ORGANIZATION>Sea Containers</ORGANIZATION>' plan raises "numerous legal, regulatory, financial and fairness issues," but didn't elaborate. 
<PERSON>Mr. Sherwood</PERSON> said reaction to <ORGANIZATION>Sea Containers</ORGANIZATION>' proposal has been "very positive." In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Sea Containers</ORGANIZATION> closed at $62.625, up 62.5 cents. 
The discussions are still in preliminary stages, and the specific details haven't been worked out between the <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> aerospace company and <ORGANIZATION>Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Giant Group</ORGANIZATION> is led by three <ORGANIZATION>Rally</ORGANIZATION>'s directors, <PERSON>Burt Sugarman</PERSON>, <PERSON>James M. Trotter III</PERSON> and <PERSON>William E. Trotter II</PERSON>, who last month indicated they hold a 42.5% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Rally's</ORGANIZATION> and plan to seek a majority of seats on <ORGANIZATION>Rally's</ORGANIZATION> nine-member board. 
<ORGANIZATION>Eaton Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it sold its <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Sierra Research Corp.</ORGANIZATION> unit to a company formed by employees of that unit.
<LOCATION>Pacific Sierra</LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, has about 200 employees and supplies professional services and advanced products to industry.
The <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> said it plans to sell $30 billion in notes and bonds next week, but said the auctions will be postponed unless <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> acts quickly to lift the federal debt ceiling. 
<PERSON>Michael Basham</PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary for federal finance, said the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> may wait until late Monday or even early Tuesday to announce whether the autions are to be rescheduled.
Unless it can raise money in financial markets, <PERSON>Mr. Basham</PERSON> said, the federal government won't have the cash to pay off $13.8 billion in <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bills that mature on Thursday. 
"Each day that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> fails to act . . . will cause additional disruption in our borrowing schedule, possibly resulting in higher interest costs to the taxpayer," Treasury Secretary <PERSON>Nicholas Brady</PERSON> said in a speech prepared for delivery last night to a group of bankers. "To avoid these costs, and a possible default, immediate action is imperative." 
None of the securities will be eligible for when-issued trading until <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> approves an increase in the debt ceiling, clearing the way for a formal offering, <PERSON>Mr. Basham</PERSON> said. 
The remaining $21.9 billion could be raised through the sale of short-term <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bills, two-year notes in November and five-year notes in early December, the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> said. 
<PERSON>Clark J. Vitulli</PERSON> was named senior vice president and general manager of this <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales and marketing arm of Japanese auto maker <ORGANIZATION>Mazda Motor Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
In the new position he will oversee <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales, service, parts and marketing operations.
Previously, <PERSON>Mr. Vitulli</PERSON>, 43 years old, was general marketing manager of <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> division.
The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> said President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has approved duty-free treatment for imports of certain types of watches that aren't produced in "significant quantities" in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Virgin Islands</LOCATION> and other <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> possessions. 
The action came in response to a petition filed by <ORGANIZATION>Timex Inc.</ORGANIZATION> for changes in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Generalized System of Preferences for imports from developing nations.
<ORGANIZATION>Timex</ORGANIZATION> had requested duty-free treatment for many types of watches, covered by 58 different <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> tariff classifications.
The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> decided to grant duty-free status for 18 categories, but turned down such treatment for other types of watches "because of the potential for material injury to watch producers located in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Virgin Islands</LOCATION>." 
<ORGANIZATION>Timex</ORGANIZATION> is a major <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> producer and seller of watches, including low-priced battery-operated watches assembled in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> and other developing nations covered by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> tariff preferences. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade officials said the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> would be the main beneficiaries of the president's action. 
Imports of the types of watches that now will be eligible for duty-free treatment totaled about $37.3 million in 1988, a relatively small share of the $1.5 billion in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> watch imports that year, according to an aide to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON>Carla Hills</PERSON>.

The next province? "Anything's possible -- how about the <LOCATION>New Guinea</LOCATION> Fund?" quips <PERSON>George Foot</PERSON>, a managing partner at <ORGANIZATION>Newgate Management Associates</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Northampton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>.
The surge brings to nearly 50 the number of country funds that are or soon will be listed in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
"People are looking to stake their claims" now before the number of available nations runs out, says <PERSON>Michael Porter</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
And many emerging markets have outpaced more mature markets, such as the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
When the stock market dropped nearly 7% Oct. 13, for instance, the <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> Fund plunged about 18% and the <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> Fund fell 16%.
"I'm very alarmed to see these rich valuations," says <ORGANIZATION>Smith Barney</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Porter</PERSON>. 
Unlike many <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> investors, those in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> seeking foreign-stock exposure may be less resistant to paying higher prices for country funds. 
They argue that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> investors often can buy American depositary receipts on the big stocks in many funds; these so-called ADRs represent shares of foreign companies traded in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
For people who insist on jumping in now to buy the funds, <ORGANIZATION>Newgate</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Foot</PERSON> says: "The only advice I have for these folks is that those who come to the party late had better be ready to leave quickly." 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> are holding technical talks about possible repayment by <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> of $188 million in pre-Communist Russian debts owed to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government, the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> said. 
If the debts are repaid, it could clear the way for Soviet bonds to be sold in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> However, after two meetings with the Soviets, a <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said that it's "too early to say" whether that will happen. 
Coincident with the talks, the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> said it has permitted a Soviet bank to open a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> branch.
Under a 1934 law, the Johnson Debt Default Act, as amended, it's illegal for Americans to extend credit to countries in default to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government, unless they are members of the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION>, trying to keep pace with rival <ORGANIZATION>Time magazine</ORGANIZATION>, announced new advertising rates for 1990 and said it will introduce a new incentive plan for advertisers. 
The new ad plan from <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of the <ORGANIZATION>Washington Post Co.</ORGANIZATION>, is the second incentive plan the magazine has offered advertisers in three years.
Plans that give advertisers discounts for maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news weeklies and underscore the fierce competition between <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Time magazine</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Mortimer B. Zuckerman</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>U.S. News & World</ORGANIZATION> Report. 
<PERSON>Alan Spoon</PERSON>, recently named <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION> president, said <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION>'s ad rates would increase 5% in January.
In mid-October, <ORGANIZATION>Time magazine</ORGANIZATION> lowered its guaranteed circulation rate base for 1990 while not increasing ad page rates; with a lower circulation base, <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION>'s ad rate will be effectively 7.5% higher per subscriber; a full page in <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION> costs about $120,000.
<PERSON>Mr. Spoon</PERSON> said the plan is not an attempt to shore up a decline in ad pages in the first nine months of 1989; <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION>'s ad pages totaled 1,620, a drop of 3.2% from last year, according to <ORGANIZATION>Publishers Information Bureau</ORGANIZATION>. "What matters is what advertisers are paying per page, and in that department we are doing fine this fall," said <PERSON>Mr. Spoon</PERSON>. 
Both <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>U.S. News</ORGANIZATION> have been gaining circulation in recent years without heavy use of electronic giveaways to subscribers, such as telephones or watches.
According to <ORGANIZATION>Audit Bureau of Circulations</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION>, the largest newsweekly, had average circulation of 4,393,237, a decrease of 7.3%.
The federal government suspended sales of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> savings bonds because <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> hasn't lifted the ceiling on government debt. 
Until <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> acts, the government hasn't any authority to issue new debt obligations of any kind, the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> said. 
The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> has voted to raise the ceiling to $3.1 trillion, but the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> isn't expected to act until next week at the earliest.
The <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> will default on Nov. 9 if <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> doesn't act by then. 
<ORGANIZATION>Alleghany Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it completed the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Sacramento Savings & Loan Association</ORGANIZATION> from the <ORGANIZATION>H.N. & Frances C. Berger Foundation</ORGANIZATION> for $150 million. 
A licensing company representing the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION> added <ORGANIZATION>Johnson & Johnson</ORGANIZATION> to its lawsuit challenging a university faculty member over rights to Retin-A acne medicine. 
<ORGANIZATION>University Patents Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Westport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, said it seeks <ORGANIZATION>Johnson & Johnson</ORGANIZATION>'s profits from sales of Retin-A, estimated at $50 million, a similar amount of punitive damages and the right to license Retin-A elsewhere. 
In May, <ORGANIZATION>University Patents</ORGANIZATION> filed a suit in federal court in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> against <PERSON>Albert M. Kligman</PERSON>, a researcher and professor at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine</ORGANIZATION> who developed Retin-A in the 1960s to combat acne.
<PERSON>Dr. Kligman</PERSON> patented the medicine while employed by the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION>, but later licensed the Retin-A to a division of <ORGANIZATION>Johnson & Johnson</ORGANIZATION>. 
In <LOCATION>New Brunswick</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Johnson & Johnson</ORGANIZATION> spokesman declined comment. 
<PERSON>Lord Chilver</PERSON>, 63-year-old chairman of <ORGANIZATION>English China Clays PLC</ORGANIZATION>, was named a nonexecutive director of this British chemical company. 
The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. International Trade Commission</ORGANIZATION> issued preliminary rulings under the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> anti-dumping act that imports of sweaters from <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> may be injuring a domestic industry. 
Because of the rulings, the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> will continue to investigate complaints by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sweater makers that the imports are reaching the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> at unfairly low prices in violation of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> anti-dumping act.
<ORGANIZATION>ITC</ORGANIZATION> officials said final <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>ITC</ORGANIZATION> rulings won't come until next March or later.
If both agencies find violations of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade law, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> would assess penalty duties on the imports, which already are subject to import quotas under bilateral textile and apparel trade agreements. 
Imports of manmade-fiber sweaters in 1988 totaled about $405 million from <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>, $400 million from <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> and $125 million from <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION>ITC</ORGANIZATION>. 
In another action, the <ORGANIZATION>ITC</ORGANIZATION> dismissed anti-dumping act complaints filed by <ORGANIZATION>Du Pont Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Wilmington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Del.</LOCATION>, against imports of neoprene, a type of synthetic rubber, from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Travelers</ORGANIZATION> estimated that the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> earthquake last month will result in a fourth-quarter pre-tax charge of less than $10 million. 
<ORGANIZATION>Nissan Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s second-largest car maker, announced Wednesday that the parent concern's pretax earnings in the first half ended last Sept. 30 rose 14% to 88.32 billion yen ($618.1 million) from 77.6 billion yen a year earlier.
<PERSON>Atsushi Muramatsu</PERSON>, executive vice president and chief financial officer of <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>, said, "The company has experienced a remarkable turnaround in terms of profitability since the fiscal year ending March 1987, when the sharp and rapid appreciation of the yen caused many difficulties. 
On the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>, a "side car" is put into effect when the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> futures rise or fall 12 points.
On the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 futures are not allowed to fall further than 12 points from the previous day's close for half an hour.
The most common program-trading vehicles are futures contracts on <ORGANIZATION>Standard & poor</ORGANIZATION>'s 500-stock index (traded on the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION>); the Major Market Index, a 20-stock index that mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average (traded on the <ORGANIZATION>chicago Board of Trade</ORGANIZATION>); and the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 100 options (traded on the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Board Options Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, and based on 100 stocks selected from the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500). 
For example, there are options on the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 futures contract and on the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 100 index. 
<PERSON>William C. Walbrecher Jr.</PERSON>, an executive at San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION>1st Nationwide Bank</ORGANIZATION>, was named president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Citadel Holding Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and its principal operating unit, <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Federal Bank</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Edward L. Kane</PERSON> succeeded <PERSON>Mr. Taylor</PERSON> as chairman. 
In <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>Citadel</ORGANIZATION> shares closed yesterday at $45.75, down 25 cents. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ratners Group PLC</ORGANIZATION>, a fast-growing, acquisition-minded London-based jeweler, raised its price for Seattle-based specialty jeweler <ORGANIZATION>Weisfield's Inc.</ORGANIZATION> to $57.50 a share, or $62.1 million, from $50 a share, or $55 million, after another concern said it would be prepared to outbid <ORGANIZATION>Ratners</ORGANIZATION>'s initial offer.
<ORGANIZATION>Ratners</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, <PERSON>Gerald Ratner</PERSON>, said the deal remains of "substantial benefit to <ORGANIZATION>Ratners</ORGANIZATION>." In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> at mid-afternoon yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Ratners</ORGANIZATION>'s shares were up 2 pence (1.26 cents), at 260 pence ($1.64). 
The acquisition of 87-store <ORGANIZATION>Weisfield</ORGANIZATION>'s raises <ORGANIZATION>Ratners</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> presence to 450 stores.
About 30% of <ORGANIZATION>Ratners</ORGANIZATION>'s profit already is derived from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
Demand from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> also grew, but due to increasing production at local plants, overseas sales edged down 2.8%. 
The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration's nomination of <PERSON>Clarence Thomas</PERSON> to a seat on the federal appeals court here received a blow this week when the <ORGANIZATION>American Bar Association</ORGANIZATION> gave <PERSON>Mr. Thomas</PERSON> only a "qualified" rating, rather than "well qualified." 
People familiar with the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION>, which will vote on the nomination, said some liberal members of the panel are likely to question the <ORGANIZATION>ABA</ORGANIZATION> rating in hearings on the matter.
<PERSON>Mr. Thomas</PERSON>, currently chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</ORGANIZATION>, would add another conservative voice to the closely divided court.
Fourteen members of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> with jurisdiction over the <ORGANIZATION>EEOC</ORGANIZATION> have said they oppose <PERSON>Mr. Thomas</PERSON>'s nomination because of "serious questions about his judgment {and} respect for the law." 
A senior <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> official, however, said the administration isn't worried about the <ORGANIZATION>ABA</ORGANIZATION> rating. "We're pleased the <ORGANIZATION>ABA</ORGANIZATION> rated him qualified," <PERSON>David Runkel</PERSON>, the department's chief spokesman, said in an interview. 
<ORGANIZATION>Carnival Cruise Lines Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said potential problems with the construction of two big cruise ships from <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION> have been averted. 
Last week, Miami-based <ORGANIZATION>Carnival</ORGANIZATION> disclosed that <ORGANIZATION>Waertsilae Marine Industries</ORGANIZATION>, the Finnish shipyard that is building <ORGANIZATION>Carnival</ORGANIZATION>'s new cruise ships, planned to file for bankruptcy. 
Yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Carnival</ORGANIZATION> said a new company has been formed in <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION> that will carry on <ORGANIZATION>Waertsilae</ORGANIZATION>'s shipbuilding operations.
<ORGANIZATION>A.L. Williams Corp.</ORGANIZATION> was merged into <ORGANIZATION>Primerica Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, after a special meeting of <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION> shareholders cleared the transaction, the companies said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Primerica</ORGANIZATION>, which had owned nearly 70% of <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION>, will pay about 16.7 million shares, currently valued at almost $472 million, for the rest of <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION> shares, which were to be delisted from the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> after the close of composite trading yesterday, closed at $23.25, off 12.5 cents.
<ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Duluth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, is an insurance and financial-services holding company.
<ORGANIZATION>Intermec Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, offering of 1,050,000 common shares, via <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Middlesex Water Co.</ORGANIZATION>, offering of 150,000 shares of common stock, via <ORGANIZATION>Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Midwesco Filter Resources Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, initial offering of 830,000 common shares, to be offered by the company, via <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Prime Motor Inns Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, offering of up to $300 million zero coupon convertible debentures, via <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Montgomery Securities</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Service Fracturing Co.</ORGANIZATION>, proposed offering of 1.2 million shares of common stock, via <ORGANIZATION>Lovett Mitchell Webb & Garrison, Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Blunt Ellis & Loewi Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Western Gas Resources Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, initial offering of 3,250,000 shares of common stock, of which 3,040,000 shares will be sold by the company and 210,000 shares by a holder, via <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Capital Funding</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Smith Barney</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Harris Upham & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Hanifen, Imhoff Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Reuters Holdings PLC</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Michael Reupke</PERSON> resigned as general manager to pursue unspecified interests, a move the news organization termed an "amicable separation." 
<PERSON>Mr. Reupke</PERSON>, 52 years old and a 27-year <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> veteran, had been the information-services company's general manager for only six months.
No successor was named, and <PERSON>Mr. Reupke</PERSON>'s duties will be split among three other senior <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> executives, the company said. 
<PERSON>Mr. Reupke</PERSON> was one of three executives on <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION>'s eight-person executive committee who didn't also serve on the company's board of directors. "If I were choosing the people of tomorrow, I would have chosen the people who are now on the board," he said. 
A <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the departure reflects "no change in strategy or profits." <PERSON>Mark Shepperd</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>UBS Phillips & Drew</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, said, "I suspect (the departure) will be fairly irrelevant for the company.
I would be very surprised if his departure signals any change in strategy or change in profit expectations." On <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> shares rose five pence to 913 pence ($14.43).
In the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> over-the-counter market, American depositary shares for <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION>, each representing three shares in the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> market, closed unchanged at $43.875. 
The senior of the three executives who will assume <PERSON>Mr. Reupke</PERSON>'s duties is <PERSON>Nigel Judah</PERSON>, 58, finance director and a <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> board director.
<ORGANIZATION>Intelogic Trace Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, said it bought 2.7 million shares, or about 18%, of its common stock from an unaffiliated shareholder for $3.625 a share, or $9.9 million. 
The move boosts <ORGANIZATION>Intelogic</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Asher Edelman</PERSON>'s stake to 20% from 16.2% and may help prevent <PERSON>Martin Ackerman</PERSON> from making a run at the computer-services concern.
<PERSON>Mr. Ackerman</PERSON> already is seeking to oust <PERSON>Mr. Edelman</PERSON> as chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Datapoint Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, an <ORGANIZATION>Intelogic</ORGANIZATION> affiliate. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Intelogic</ORGANIZATION> shares rose 37.5 cents to close at $2.75. 
<PERSON>Mr. Edelman</PERSON> declined to specify what prompted the recent moves, saying they are meant only to benefit shareholders when "the company is on a roll." He added, "This has nothing to do with <PERSON>Marty Ackerman</PERSON> and it is not designed, particularly, to take the company private." 
But <PERSON>Mr. Ackerman</PERSON> said the buy-back, and the above-market price paid, prove that <PERSON>Mr. Edelman</PERSON> is running scared. 
<ORGANIZATION>DD Acquisition Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a partnership of <ORGANIZATION>Unicorp Canada Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Kingsbridge Capital Group</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Cara Operations Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, extended to Nov. 20 its $45-a-share offer for all <ORGANIZATION>Dunkin' Donuts Inc.</ORGANIZATION> shares outstanding. 
<ORGANIZATION>DD Acquisition</ORGANIZATION> has launched a suit in a <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION> court seeking the withdrawal of <PERSON>Dunkin</PERSON>'s poison pill rights and employee stock ownership plans, which it claims were put in place to deter bidders. 
<ORGANIZATION>Dunkin'</ORGANIZATION> is based in <LOCATION>Randolph</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Cara</ORGANIZATION>, a food services chain operator and <ORGANIZATION>Unicorp</ORGANIZATION>, a holding company, are based in <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>. 
Professors <PERSON>Philip Kurland</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Chicago</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Laurence Tribe</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Harvard Law School</ORGANIZATION> said any effort by President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to claim authority for a line-item veto would contradict the text of the Constitution and the intent of its authors, as well as the views of previous presidents. 
But the two legal experts, responding to an inquiry by <PERSON>Sen. Edward Kennedy</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>), wrote in a joint letter that the president "lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item veto." The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- <PERSON>Mr. Kurland</PERSON> is a conservative and <PERSON>Mr. Tribe</PERSON> is a liberal. 
<PERSON>Sen. Kennedy</PERSON> said in a separate statement that he supports legislation to give the president line-item veto power, but that it would be a "reckless course of action" for President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to claim the authority without congressional approval. 
Despite a deluge of economic news, the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> market remained quiet but the corporate market was abuzz over <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's huge debt offering. 
"There were so many economic reports but the market didn't care about any of them," said <PERSON>Kathleen Camilli</PERSON>, a money market economist at <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "So the focus turned to other fixed-income markets, corporate and mortgages in particular," she said. 
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>, the giant computer maker, offered $750 million of non-callable 30-year debentures priced to yield 8.47%, or about 1/2 percentage point higher than the yield on 30-year <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bonds. 
In the investment-grade corporate market, "it's rare that you get an opportunity to buy a name that has such broad appeal and has such attractive call features," said <PERSON>James Ednie</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> industrial bond trader. 
"Whether you thought the economy was growing weak or holding steady, �yesterday's� economic indicators didn't change your opinion," said <PERSON>Charles Lieberman</PERSON>, a managing director at <ORGANIZATION>Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
A survey by the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION>'s 12 district banks and the latest report by the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Purchasing Management</ORGANIZATION> blurred that picture of the economy.
In a monthly report prepared for use at the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>'s next <ORGANIZATION>Federal Open Market Committee</ORGANIZATION> meeting on Nov. 14., the nation's central bank found that price increases have moderated and economic activity has grown at a sluggish pace in recent weeks. 
The <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> districts, for example, reported declines in manufacturing activity while the <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> banks noted that business expanded. 
<ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION>'s said those returns compare with a 3.8% total return for longer-term <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> notes and bonds.
For the year to date, <ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION>'s said total returns were topped by the 16.5% of longer-term <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> issues, closely followed by 15% for investment-grade bonds.
Junk bonds trailed the group again. "Even the 7.2% return from the risk-free three-month <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bill has easily outdistanced the 4.1% return from junk bonds," wrote <ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION>'s economist <PERSON>John Lonski</PERSON> in yesterday's market report. "Little wonder that buyers for junk have been found wanting," he said. 
A $114 million issue of health facility revenue bonds from the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Health Facilities Financing Authority</ORGANIZATION> was temporarily withdrawn after being tentatively priced by a <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp.</ORGANIZATION> group. 
A $107.03 million offering of <ORGANIZATION>Santa Ana Community Redevelopment Agency</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, tax allocation bonds got off to a slow start and may be repriced at lower levels today, according to an official with lead underwriter <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
Bucking the market trend, an issue of $130 million general obligation distributable state aid bonds from <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, apparently drew solid investor interest.
The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> passed legislation designed to make it easier for the <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION> to block airline leveraged buy-outs. 
While the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Commerce Committee</ORGANIZATION> has approved legislation similar to the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> bill on airline leveraged buy-outs, the measure hasn't yet come to the full floor. 
Although the legislation would apply to acquisitions involving any major airline, it is aimed at giving the <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION> the chance to review in advance transactions financed by large amounts of debt. "The purpose of the bill is to put the brakes on airline acquisitions that would so load a carrier up with debt that it would impede safety or a carrier's ability to compete," Rep. <PERSON>John Paul Hammerschmidt</PERSON>, (R., <LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>) said. 
The bill, as it was approved by the <ORGANIZATION>House Public Works and Transportation Committee</ORGANIZATION>, would give the <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION> up to 50 days to review any purchase of 15% or more of the stock in an airline.
The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> approved an amendment offered by Rep. <PERSON>Peter DeFazio</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>) that would, in addition to the previous criteria, also require the department to block the acquisition of an airline if the added debt incurred were likely to result in a reduction in the number of the carrier's employees, or their wages or benefits. 
Rep. <PERSON>James Traficant</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>), said the amendment, which passed 271-147, would "let the American worker know that we consider them occasionally." But Rep. <PERSON>Hammerschmidt</PERSON> said that the provision, which he dubbed a "special interest" amendment, was likely to make the bill even more controversial. 
On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> approved a labor-backed amendment that would require the <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION> to reject airline acquisitions if the person seeking to purchase a carrier had run two or more airlines previously that have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. 
The provision, called the "two-time-losers" amendment by its supporters, apparently was aimed at preventing <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON> from attempting to take over another airline. 
<ORGANIZATION>Equitable of Iowa Cos.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Des Moines</LOCATION>, had been seeking a buyer for the 36-store <ORGANIZATION>Younkers</ORGANIZATION> chain since June, when it announced its intention to free up capital to expand its insurance business.
But <ORGANIZATION>Equitable</ORGANIZATION> said it was unable to find a buyer willing to pay what it considers "fair value" for <ORGANIZATION>Younkers</ORGANIZATION> because of recent turmoil in the bond and stock markets and in retailing. 
It operates stores mostly in <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Younkers</ORGANIZATION> management is likely to buy a 10% to 20% interest in the chain in January, said <PERSON>Fred S. Hubbell</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Equitable</ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer.
He said <ORGANIZATION>Equitable</ORGANIZATION> hopes to eventually reduce its stake in <ORGANIZATION>Younkers</ORGANIZATION> to less than 50%. 
The offer, valued at about $576 million for the 33% of <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> doesn't already own, had been set to expire Nov. 6. 
<ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION>, which owns about 64 million of <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION>'s 95 million common shares outstanding, said that about 24,000 shares have been tendered under its offer. 
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at $19.50, up 12.5 cents. 
The <LOCATION>Van Nuys</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, thrift had net income of $132,000, or three cents a share, a year ago. 
<PERSON>Robert L. Bernstein</PERSON>, chairman and president of <ORGANIZATION>Random House Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, announced his resignation from the publishing house he has run for 23 years. 
A successor wasn't named, which fueled speculation that <PERSON>Mr. Bernstein</PERSON> may have clashed with <PERSON>S.I. Newhouse Jr.</PERSON>, whose family company, <ORGANIZATION>Advance Publications Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, owns <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>.
In an interview, <PERSON>Mr. Bernstein</PERSON> said his departure "evolved out of discussions with <PERSON>Si Newhouse</PERSON> and that's the decision I reached." He declined to elaborate, other than to say, "It just seemed the right thing to do at this minute.
<PERSON>Mr. Newhouse</PERSON>, meanwhile, insisted that he isn't unhappy with <PERSON>Mr. Bernstein</PERSON> or the performance of <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>, the largest trade publishing house in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
The company said the publisher's annual sales volume increased to $800 million from $40 million during <PERSON>Mr. Bernstein</PERSON>'s tenure. "Bob has handled the extraordinary growth of the company quite brilliantly," said <PERSON>Mr. Newhouse</PERSON>. "The company is doing well, it's stable, it's got good people.
<PERSON>Mr. Bernstein</PERSON>, who succeeded <PERSON>Bennett Cerf</PERSON>, has been only the second president of <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> since it was founded in 1925.
Possible candidates include <PERSON>Susan Petersen</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Ballantine/Del Rey/ Fawcett</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>'s huge and successful paperback division.
Some say <PERSON>Anthony Cheetham</PERSON>, head of a recently acquired British company, <ORGANIZATION>Century Hutchinson</ORGANIZATION>, could be chosen. 
There is also speculation that <PERSON>Mr. Newhouse</PERSON> could bring in a powerhouse businessman or another <PERSON>Newhouse</PERSON> family member to run the business side, in combination with a publishing executive like <PERSON>Robert Gottlieb</PERSON>, who left <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Alfred A. Knopf</ORGANIZATION> to run the <ORGANIZATION>New Yorker</ORGANIZATION>, also owned by the <PERSON>Newhouse</PERSON> family. 
Not included on the most-likely-successor list are <PERSON>Joni Evans</PERSON>, recruited two years ago to be publisher of adult trade books for <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Sonny Mehta</ORGANIZATION>, president of the prestigious <ORGANIZATION>Alfred A. Knopf</ORGANIZATION> unit.
Most recently, <PERSON>Mr. Veraldi</PERSON>, 59 years old, has been vice president of product and manufacturing engineering at <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co</ORGANIZATION>.
But he is best known in the auto industry as the creator of a team car-development approach that produced the two midsized cars that were instrumental in helping the No. 2 auto maker record profits in recent years and in enabling the company's <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> division to eclipse <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Chevrolet</ORGANIZATION> division as the top-selling nameplate in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
Under the so-called Team Taurus approach, <PERSON>Mr. Veraldi</PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> product planners sought the involvement of parts suppliers, assembly-line workers, auto designers and financial staff members from the initial stages of the development cycle. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Donald E. Petersen</PERSON> said yesterday that <PERSON>Mr. Veraldi</PERSON> has "helped to change the world's perception of American-made cars." <PERSON>Mr. Veraldi</PERSON> worked at <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> for 40 years, holding a variety of car and parts-engineering positions. 
<ORGANIZATION>Meridian National Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it sold 750,000 shares of its common stock to the <PERSON>McAlpine</PERSON> family interests, for $1 million, or $1.35 a share.
The <PERSON>McAlpine</PERSON> family, which operates a number of multinational companies, including a London-based engineering and construction company, also lent to <ORGANIZATION>Meridian National</ORGANIZATION> $500,000.
The sale of shares to the <PERSON>McAlpine</PERSON> family along with the recent sale of 750,000 shares of <ORGANIZATION>Meridian</ORGANIZATION> stock to <ORGANIZATION>Haden MacLellan Holding PLC</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Surrey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and a recent public offering have increased <ORGANIZATION>Meridian</ORGANIZATION>'s net worth to $8.5 million, said <PERSON>William Feniger</PERSON>, chief executive officer of <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION>, Ohio-based <ORGANIZATION>Meridian</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>The Labor Department</ORGANIZATION> cited <ORGANIZATION>USX Corp.</ORGANIZATION> for numerous health and safety violations at two <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> plants, and proposed $7.3 million in fines, the largest penalty ever proposed for alleged workplace violations by an employer. 
The department's <ORGANIZATION>Occupational Safety and Health Administration</ORGANIZATION> proposed fines of $6.1 million for alleged violations at the company's <LOCATION>Fairless Hills</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, steel mill; that was a record for proposed penalties at any single facility.
A second citation covering the company's <LOCATION>Clairton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, coke works involved more than 200 alleged violations of electrical-safety and other requirements, for which <ORGANIZATION>OSHA</ORGANIZATION> proposed $1.2 million in fines. 
<PERSON>Gerard Scannell</PERSON>, the head of <ORGANIZATION>OSHA</ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> managers have known about many of the safety and health deficiencies at the plants for years, "yet have failed to take necessary action to counteract the hazards." 
"Particularly flagrant," <PERSON>Mrs. Dole</PERSON> said, "are the company's numerous failures to properly record injuries at its <LOCATION>Fairless</LOCATION> works, in spite of the firm promise it had made in an earlier corporate-wide settlement agreement to correct such discrepancies." That settlement was in April 1987. 
A <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the company hadn't yet received any documents from <ORGANIZATION>OSHA</ORGANIZATION> regarding the penalty or fine. "Once we do, they will receive very serious evaluation," the spokesman said. "No consideration is more important than the health and safety of our employees." 
<ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> said it has been cooperating with <ORGANIZATION>OSHA</ORGANIZATION> since the agency began investigating the <LOCATION>Clairton</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Fairless</LOCATION> works.
The <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> citations represented the first sizable enforcement action taken by <ORGANIZATION>OSHA</ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON>Mr. Scannell</PERSON>.
"The big problem is that <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> management has proved unwilling to devote the necessary resources and manpower to removing hazards and to safeguarding safety and health in the plants," said <PERSON>Linda Anku</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>OSHA</ORGANIZATION> regional administrator in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> has 15 working days to contest the citations and proposed penalties, before the independent <ORGANIZATION>Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission</ORGANIZATION>. 
Before the <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> case, <ORGANIZATION>OSHA</ORGANIZATION>'s largest proposed fine for one employer was $4.3 million for alleged safety violations at <ORGANIZATION>John Morrell & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a meatpacking subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>United Brands Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> learned during the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration that it could intimidate the executive branch by uttering again and again the same seven words: "Provided, that no funds shall be spent. . . ." This phrase once again is found throughout the many appropriations bills now moving through <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
The appropriations clause states that "No Money shall be drawn from the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law. . . ." The prevailing interpretation of the clause on <LOCATION>Capitol Hill</LOCATION> is that it gives <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of the president through the ability to withhold funding.
It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause (technically a limitation on legislative power) could be read as placing the president on <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>'s short leash, making the executive consist of the president and every member of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. 
The 1990 appropriations legislation attempts to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by Article II. Article II places on the president the duty to nominate, "and by and with the Advice and Consent of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>" appoint, ambassadors, judges, and other officers of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
It also empowers the president to make recess appointments, without <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> approval: "The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session." 
Yet Section 605 of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides: "No part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other Act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated after the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> has voted not to approve the nomination of said person." Thus, with one brief passage in an appropriations bill, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> repeals the president's power to make recess appointments under Article II. 
Perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better illustrates <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to usurp executive power than Section 609 of the executive-office bill: "None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement, administer, or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>." 
The <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>'s decision in <ORGANIZATION>INS</ORGANIZATION> v.
If President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> fails to do so in his first year, he will invite <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, for the remainder of his presidency, to rewrite Article II of the Constitution to suit its purposes.
By 1987, then-Speaker <PERSON>Jim Wright</PERSON> was discussing arms control in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> with <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON> and then attempting to direct the president, through an appropriations rider, to treat the Soviets as though the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> had ratified SALT II. 
If <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> does nothing, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> will have won.
If <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> takes the dispute to the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> (assuming it can establish standing to sue), President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> might win.
If President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> loses at the court, it might be disappointing, as <PERSON>Morrison</PERSON> v.
<PERSON>Olson</PERSON> was for the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration.
As it stands now, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> presumes after the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration that the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down.

The <LOCATION>Avon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, company's stock hit a high in 1983 after it unveiled its Adam home computer, but the product was plagued with glitches and the company's fortunes plunged.
A spokesman for the <LOCATION>Stamford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>based company said operations had a loss of $5.5 million for the quarter; in addition, the loss was magnified by nonrecurring charges totaling $23.5 million and $8.2 million in asset-valuation adjustments that he described as "unusual." The charges were partly offset by a $2 million gain on the sale of investments of two joint ventures, he said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Savin</ORGANIZATION> cited "a general softening in the demand for office products in the market segments in which <ORGANIZATION>Savin</ORGANIZATION> competes." 
The downgrading of debt issued by <ORGANIZATION>CS First Boston Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, by <ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, coupled with a <ORGANIZATION>Moody's</ORGANIZATION> announcement that <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION> is under review for a possible downgrade, sent shivers through the brokerage community this week.
But <ORGANIZATION>Moody's</ORGANIZATION> warned that <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>'s commercial paper rating could be lowered soon, a move that would reduce <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>'s profit margins on its borrowings and signal trouble ahead for other firms.
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> is 62%-owned by <ORGANIZATION>American Express Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
"Just as the 1980s bull market transformed the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> securities business, so too will the more difficult environment of the 1990s," says <PERSON>Christopher T. Mahoney</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Moody's</ORGANIZATION> vice president. "A sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible." <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor's Corp.</ORGANIZATION> says <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, in particular, are likely to have difficulty shoring up their credit standing in months ahead. 
"The recent disarray in the junk bond market suggests that brokers may become longer-term creditors than they anticipated and may face long delays" in getting their money back, says <PERSON>Jeffrey Bowman</PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION>, which raised a warning flag for the industry in April when it downgraded <ORGANIZATION>CS First Boston</ORGANIZATION>. 
"Wall Street is facing a Catch-22 situation," says <PERSON>Mr. Mahoney</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Moody's</ORGANIZATION>.
Both <ORGANIZATION>Moody's</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> cited <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION>'s reliance in recent years on merchant banking, which has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely held firm's profit.
The recent cash squeeze at <ORGANIZATION>Campeau Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION>'s most lucrative client of the decade, is proving costly to <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION> because it arranged more than $3 billion of high-yield, high-risk junk financings for <ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION> units.
In addition, a big loan that <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION> made to <ORGANIZATION>Ohio Mattress Co.</ORGANIZATION> wasn't repaid on time when its $450 million junk financing for a buy-out of the bedding company was withdrawn. 
"These two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of <ORGANIZATION>CS First Boston</ORGANIZATION>'s equity," <ORGANIZATION>Moody's</ORGANIZATION> said. "Total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm's equity." <ORGANIZATION>CS First Boston</ORGANIZATION>, however, benefits from the backing of its largest shareholder, <ORGANIZATION>Credit Suisse</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>'s third largest bank. 
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> "really only has $300 million of capital," says <PERSON>Mr. Bowman</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION>. 
A <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the firm isn't worried. "A year ago, <ORGANIZATION>Moody's</ORGANIZATION> also had <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> under review for possible downgrade," he said. "After two months of talks, our rating was maintained." <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, already competes at a disadvantage to its big Wall Street rivals because it has a slightly lower commercial paper rating. 
<ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> remains confident of its future creditworthiness. "We're well positioned with $1.7 billion of capital," a <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. "And as a leading investment and merchant banking firm, the fact that we are no longer subject to the uncertainties and vicissitudes of the retail business is a major plus in our view.

<ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION> completed its tender offer for <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, with <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> shareholders tendering 99.3% of all common shares outstanding by the Tuesday deadline. 
<ORGANIZATION>Sony Columbia Acquisition Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, formed for the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> deal, will formally take ownership of the movie studio later this month, a spokesman said.
Still unresolved is <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>'s effort to hire producers <PERSON>Jon Peters</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peter Guber</PERSON> to run the studio.
<ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>'s planned acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Guber/Peters Entertainment Co.</ORGANIZATION> for $200 million is scheduled to close Monday.
Guber/Peters has been locked in litigation with <ORGANIZATION>Warner Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in an attempt to get out of an exclusive production contract with <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>.
Everything will be taken over by the new company," said <PERSON>Christian Andersson</PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Oy Waertsilae</ORGANIZATION>, former parent of <ORGANIZATION>Waertsilae Marine</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Waertsilae Marine</ORGANIZATION>'s biggest creditor is Miami-based <ORGANIZATION>Carnival Cruise Lines Inc</ORGANIZATION>. Carnival, which has three ships on order from <ORGANIZATION>Waertsilae Marine</ORGANIZATION>, presented claims for $1.5 billion damages in the bankruptcy court this week. 
<ORGANIZATION>Waertsilae Marine</ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy proceedings began Tuesday in a <LOCATION>Helsinki</LOCATION> court. 
<ORGANIZATION>First Chicago Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it completed its $55.1 million cash-and-stock acquisition of closely held <ORGANIZATION>Ravenswood Financial Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, another <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> bank holding company. 
<ORGANIZATION>American City Business Journals Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said its president, <PERSON>Michael K. Russell</PERSON>, will resign rather than relocate to new headquarters in <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION> 
<PERSON>Mr. Russell</PERSON>, who co-founded the <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, Mo.-based local business publications concern here, said he would have a five-year consulting agreement with the company, which recently underwent an ownership change. 
Earlier this year <ORGANIZATION>Shaw Publishing Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>, acquired 30% of <ORGANIZATION>American City</ORGANIZATION> and has an agreement to acquire a further 25% from <ORGANIZATION>E.W. Scripps Co.</ORGANIZATION> next year.
<PERSON>Ray Shaw</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>American City</ORGANIZATION>, said he would assume <PERSON>Mr. Russell</PERSON>'s responsibilities if a successor isn't found this month. 
<PERSON>Harry Millis</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>McDonald & Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>GenCorp</ORGANIZATION>'s unanticipated losses come largely from an accident at a government-owned assembly plant in <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, run by a private subcontractor, that makes cluster bombs for <ORGANIZATION>GenCorp</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Aerojet Ordnance</ORGANIZATION> business. 
<ORGANIZATION>Transamerica Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, said third-quarter profit was essentially flat despite a large one-time gain a year earlier. 
Program trading is "a racket," complains <PERSON>Edward Egnuss</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>White Plains</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, investor and electronics sales executive, "and it's not to the benefit of the small investor, that's for sure." But although he thinks that it is hurting him, he doubts it could be stopped. 
"I think program trading is basically unfair to the individual investor," says <PERSON>Leo Fields</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> investor.
Or, as <PERSON>Dorothy Arighi</PERSON>, an interior decorator in <LOCATION>Arnold</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, puts it: "All kinds of funny things spook the market these days." But she believes that "program trading creates deviant swings.
At the <ORGANIZATION>Charles Schwab & Co.</ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Buckhead district</LOCATION>, a group of investors voices skepticism that federal officials would curb program trading.
Citing the October 1987 crash, <PERSON>Glenn Miller</PERSON> says, "It's like the last crash -- they threatened, but no one did anything." <PERSON>A. Donald Anderson</PERSON>, a 59-year-old <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> investor who says the stock market's "fluctuations and gyrations give me the heebie-jeebies," doesn't see much point in outlawing program trading.
Similarly, <PERSON>Rick Wamre</PERSON>, a 31-year-old asset manager for a <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> real-estate firm, would like to see program trading disappear because "I can't see that it does anything for the market or the country." Yet he isn't in favor of new legislation. "I think we've got enough securities laws," he says. "I'd much rather see them dealing with interest rates and the deficit." 
<PERSON>Peter Anthony</PERSON>, who runs an employment agency in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, decries program trading as "limiting the game to a few," but he also isn't sure it should be more strictly regulated. "I don't want to denounce it because denouncing it would be like denouncing capitalism," he explains. 
<PERSON>Glenn Britta</PERSON>, a 25-year-old <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> financial analyst who plays options for his personal account, says he is "factoring" the market's volatility "into investment decisions." He adds that program trading "increases liquidity in the market.
Also in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Israel Silverman</PERSON>, an insurance-company lawyer, comments that program trading "increases volatility, but I don't think it should be banned.
<PERSON>Jim Enzor</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> defends program trading because he believes that it can bring the market back up after a plunge. "If we have a real bad day, the program would say, `Buy, '" he explains. "If you could get the rhythm of the program trading, you could take advantage of it." 
<PERSON>Scott Taccetta</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> accountant, is going into money-market funds.
In October, before the market dropped, <PERSON>Mrs. Arighi</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Arnold</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, moved to sell the "speculative stocks" in her family trust "so we will be able to withstand all this flim-flammery" caused by program trading.
<PERSON>Lucille Gorman</PERSON>, an 84-year-old <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> housewife, has become amazingly immune to stock-market jolts.
Junk-bond markdowns, an ongoing <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> investigation, a <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert</ORGANIZATION> connection, a fizzled buy-out rumor. 
All this has cast a pall over <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Savings & Loan Association</ORGANIZATION> and its high-rolling 43-year-old chairman, <PERSON>Thomas Spiegel</PERSON>, who built the $12.7 billion <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, thrift with high-yield junk bonds.
And some investors fault <PERSON>Mr. Spiegel</PERSON>'s life style; he earns millions of dollars a year and flies around in <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s jet planes. 
<ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> stock recently hit 4 1/8, after reaching 11 3/4 earlier this year on rumors that <PERSON>Mr. Spiegel</PERSON> would take the thrift private.
<PERSON>Mr. Spiegel</PERSON>'s fans say <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> branches are highly salable, and the thrift has $458 million of shareholders equity underlying its assets.
Other big common holders are <PERSON>Carl Lindner</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>American Financial</ORGANIZATION>, investor <PERSON>Irwin Jacobs</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Financial Research</ORGANIZATION>, though the latter cut its stake this summer. 
While many problems would attend a restructuring of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>, investors say <PERSON>Mr. Spiegel</PERSON> is mulling such a plan to mitigate <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s junk problems.
Indeed, <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> executives recently told reporters they were interested in creating a separate unit to hold <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s junk bonds and perhaps do merchant banking. 
<ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>, a longtime <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> client, won't provide current data on its junk.
These were <ORGANIZATION>Allied Stores</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Western Union Telegraph</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Gillett Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>SCI Television</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>, though many other bonds in <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s portfolio also have lost value.
One trial balloon <PERSON>Mr. Spiegel</PERSON> is said to have floated to investors: <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> might be broken up, as <ORGANIZATION>Mellon Bank</ORGANIZATION> was split into a good bank and a bad bank.
But <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s good bank would be a regulated thrift, while the bad bank would be a private investment company, holding some of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s junk bonds, real estate and equity investments. 
Some think <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s thrift, which now is seeking a new chief operating officer, might be capitalized at, say $300 million, and shopped to a commercial bank that wants a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> presence.
Meanwhile, the bad bank with the junk bonds -- and some capital -- might be spun off to <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> shareholders, including <PERSON>Mr. Spiegel</PERSON>, who might then have a new career, investors say. 
You sell the good bank as an ongoing operation and use some of the proceeds to capitalize the bad bank," says thrift specialist <PERSON>Lewis Ranieri</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Ranieri Associates</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
Few people think <PERSON>Mr. Spiegel</PERSON> wants to run a bread-and-butter thrift, which current rules would force <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> to become. 
"They aren't really a thrift," says <PERSON>Jonathan Gray</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Sanford C. Bernstein</ORGANIZATION> analyst. 
And some investment bankers say a restructuring isn't feasible while the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> still is scrutinizing <PERSON>Mr. Spiegel</PERSON>'s past junk-bond trades.

After years of struggling, the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Herald Examiner</ORGANIZATION> will publish its last edition today, shut down by its parent, <ORGANIZATION>Hearst Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, following unsuccessful efforts to sell the venerable newspaper. 
But it faces stiff competition in <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> from the <ORGANIZATION>Orange County Register</ORGANIZATION>, which sells more than 300,000 copies a day, and in the <LOCATION>San Fernando Valley</LOCATION> from the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Daily News</ORGANIZATION>, which sells more than 170,000.
Nearby cities such as <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION> also have large dailies. 
In July, closely held <ORGANIZATION>Hearst</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, put the paper on the block.
The prospective buyers included investor <PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Sun</ORGANIZATION>. 
Further, the <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> seemed torn editorially between keeping its old-time <ORGANIZATION>Hearst</ORGANIZATION> readership -- blue-collar and sports-oriented -- and trying to provide a sprightly, upscale alternative to the sometimes staid Times.
The <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> joins the <ORGANIZATION>Baltimore News-American</ORGANIZATION>, which folded, and the <ORGANIZATION>Boston Herald-American</ORGANIZATION>, which was sold, as cornerstones of the old <ORGANIZATION>Hearst</ORGANIZATION> newspaper empire abandoned by the company in the 1980s.
Its fanciful offices were designed by architect <PERSON>Julia Morgan</PERSON>, who built the <ORGANIZATION>Hearst</ORGANIZATION> castle at <LOCATION>San Simeon</LOCATION>.
Analysts said the <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>'s demise doesn't necessarily represent the overall condition of the newspaper industry. "The <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> was a survivor from a bygone age," said <PERSON>J. Kendrick Noble</PERSON>, a media analyst with <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "Actually, the long deterioration in daily newspapers shows signs of coming to an end, and the industry looks pretty healthy." 
Founded as the <ORGANIZATION>Examiner</ORGANIZATION> in 1903 by <PERSON>Mr. Hearst</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> was crippled by a bitter, decade-long strike that began in 1967 and cut circulation in half.
In 1979, <ORGANIZATION>Hearst</ORGANIZATION> hired editor <PERSON>James Bellows</PERSON>, who brightened the editorial product considerably.
For example, the <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> consistently beat its much-larger rival on disclosures about <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Tom Bradley</PERSON>'s financial dealings.
<PERSON>Robert J. Danzig</PERSON>, vice president and general manager of <ORGANIZATION>Hearst Newspapers</ORGANIZATION>, stood up in the paper's newsroom yesterday and announced that no buyers had stepped forward and that the paper would fold, putting more than 730 full-time employees out of work.

At <ORGANIZATION>Christie's</ORGANIZATION>, a folio of 21 prints from <PERSON>Alfred Stieglitz</PERSON>'s "Equivalents" series sold for $396,000, a single-lot record.
This information used to be poorly documented and largely anecdotal, says <PERSON>Beth Gates-Warren</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's</ORGANIZATION>. "There is finally some sort of sense in the market," she says. 
Corporations and museums are among the serious buyers, giving greater market stability, says <PERSON>Robert Persky</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Photograph Collector</ORGANIZATION>. "When I see prints going into the hands of institutions, I know they aren't going to come back on the market." Most in demand: classic photographs by masters such as <PERSON>Stieglitz</PERSON> and <PERSON>Man Ray</PERSON>.

<ORGANIZATION>Metallgesellschaft AG</ORGANIZATION> said it agreed to acquire 51% of <ORGANIZATION>Lentjes AG</ORGANIZATION> from the <ORGANIZATION>Ferdinand Lentjes Foundation</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Metallgesellschaft</ORGANIZATION>, a diversified <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, West Germany-based metals group, said it is buying the stake in the specialized engineering company to expand its production of environmental supplies for power plants.
Researchers at <ORGANIZATION>American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Bell Laboratories</ORGANIZATION> reported they raised the electrical current-carrying capacity of new superconductor crystals by a factor of 100, moving the materials closer to commercial use. 
But "it won't lead to imminent use" of new superconductors, cautioned <PERSON>Robert B. van Dover</PERSON>, one of the <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> researchers.
<PERSON>Mr. van Dover</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> team created the desired crystal changes by bombarding superconductor samples with neutrons, a process that creates some radioactivity in the samples and may not be feasible for large-scale commercial use. 
The <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> team also is trying to combine their latest superconductor process with "melt-textured growth," a process discovered earlier at <ORGANIZATION>Bell Laboratories</ORGANIZATION>.
FOREIGN PRIME RATES: <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> 13.50%; <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> 9%; <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> 4.875%; <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> 8.50%; <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> 15%.
<ORGANIZATION>FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORP.</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Freddie Mac</ORGANIZATION>): Posted yields on 30-year mortgage commitments for delivery within 30 days. 9.82%, standard conventional fixed-rate mortgages; 8.25%, 2% rate capped one-year adjustable rate mortgages.
<ORGANIZATION>FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Fannie Mae</ORGANIZATION>): Posted yields on 30 year mortgage commitments for delivery within 30 days (priced at par) 9.75%, standard conventional fixed-rate mortgages; 8.70%, 6/2 rate capped one-year adjustable rate mortgages.
A man from the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration came before the <ORGANIZATION>House Agriculture Committee</ORGANIZATION> yesterday to talk about the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>'s intention to send some $100 million in food aid to <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, with more to come from the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>.
Rep. <PERSON>Gary Ackerman</PERSON> noted that past food aid had harmed farmers in <LOCATION>El Salvador</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Oshkosh Truck Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Oshkosh</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION>, estimated earnings for its fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 fell 50% to 75% below the year-earlier $4.5 million, or 51 cents a share. 
Although his team lost the World Series, <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco Giants</ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON>Bob Lurie</PERSON> hopes to have a new home for them.
Something like one-third of the nation's 60 largest cities are thinking about new stadiums, ranging from <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>St. Petersburg</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Pepperdine University</ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON>Dean Baim</PERSON> scoffs at that.
<PERSON>George Christopher</PERSON>, the former <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> mayor who built Candlestick Park for the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> in the 1960s, won't endorse the new ballpark.
<ORGANIZATION>Miami Dolphins</ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON>Joe Robbie</PERSON> disagrees, and he can prove it.
But to <PERSON>Moon Landrieu</PERSON>, the former <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> mayor who helped build that city's cavernous, money-losing Superdome, questions of who benefits or the bottom line are of little relevance. "The Superdome is an exercise in optimism, a statement of faith," he has said. "It is the very building of it that is important, not how much of it is used or its economics." 
<PERSON>R. Gordon McGovern</PERSON> was forced out as <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Soup Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's president and chief executive officer, the strongest evidence yet of the power that <PERSON>Dorrance</PERSON> family members intend to wield in reshaping the troubled food company. 
<PERSON>Herbert M. Baum</PERSON>, the 53-year-old president of the company's <ORGANIZATION>Campbell U.S.A.</ORGANIZATION> unit, and <PERSON>Edwin L. Harper</PERSON>, 47, the chief financial officer, will run <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> as a team, dividing responsibilities rather evenly until a successor is named.
In heavy trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>'s shares rose $3.375 to close at $47.125. 
"The profit motive of the major shareholders has clearly changed for the better," said <PERSON>John McMillin</PERSON>, a food industry analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. McGovern</PERSON> was widely seen as sales, and not profit, oriented. "New managers would think a little more like Wall Street," <PERSON>Mr. McMillin</PERSON> added.
<ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>'s international businesses, particularly in the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, appear to be at the heart of its problems.
For example, <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> is a distant third in the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> frozen foods market, where it recently paid 24 times earnings for <ORGANIZATION>Freshbake Foods PLC</ORGANIZATION> and wound up with far more capacity than it could use.
Similarly, <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>'s Italian biscuit operation, <ORGANIZATION>D. Lazzaroni & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, has been hurt by overproduction and distribution problems. 
However, neither <PERSON>Mr. Baum</PERSON> nor <PERSON>Mr. Harper</PERSON> has much international experience. 
<PERSON>Mr. Baum</PERSON>, a seasoned marketer who is said to have a good rapport with <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> employees, will have responsibility for all domestic operations except the <ORGANIZATION>Pepperidge Farm</ORGANIZATION> unit.
<PERSON>Mr. Harper</PERSON>, a veteran of several manufacturing companies who joined <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> in 1986, will take charge of all overseas operations as well as <ORGANIZATION>Pepperidge</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. McGovern</PERSON>, 63, had been under intense pressure from the board to boost <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>'s mediocre performance to the level of other food companies.
The board is dominated by the heirs of the late <PERSON>John T. Dorrance Jr.</PERSON>, who controlled about 58% of <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>'s stock when he died in April.
<ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> officials said <PERSON>Mr. McGovern</PERSON> wasn't available yesterday to discuss the circumstances of his departure.
But people familiar with the agenda of the board's meeting last week in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> said <PERSON>Mr. McGovern</PERSON> was fired. 
<PERSON>Mr. McGovern</PERSON> himself had said repeatedly that he intended to stay on until he reached the conventional retirement age of 65 in October 1991, "unless I get fired." <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Mr. McGovern</PERSON> had withdrawn his name as a candidate for re-election as a director at the annual shareholder meeting, scheduled for Nov. 17. 
<PERSON>Mr. Baum</PERSON> said he and <PERSON>Mr. Harper</PERSON> both advocated closing some plants as long ago as early 1988. "You've got to make the restructuring work," said <PERSON>Mr. Baum</PERSON>. "You've got to make those savings now." 
<PERSON>Mr. Harper</PERSON> expressed confidence that he and <PERSON>Mr. Baum</PERSON> can convince the board of their worthiness to run the company. "We look upon this as a great opportunity to prove the fact that we have a tremendous management team," he said.
<PERSON>Mr. Baum</PERSON> said the two have orders to "focus on bottom-line profits" and to "take a hard look at our businesses -- what is good, what is not so good." Analysts generally applaud the performance of <ORGANIZATION>Campbell U.S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, the company's largest division, which posted 6% unit sales growth and a 15% improvement in operating profit for fiscal 1989. "The way that we've been managing <ORGANIZATION>Campbell U.S.A.</ORGANIZATION> can hopefully spread to other areas of the company," <PERSON>Mr. Baum</PERSON> said. 
Criminal charges were filed against <ORGANIZATION>Diceon Electronics Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and two company officials alleging waste disposal violations in its <LOCATION>Chatsworth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, facility. 
The <LOCATION>Los Angeles County</LOCATION> district attorney's office filed seven felony and five misdemeanor counts charging that late last year and early this year the <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>, Calif.-based circuit-board manufacturer illegally disposed of acid, caustic and heavy metals into the sewer system, and stored hazardous materials in leaky, unlabeled or open-top containers. 
Named as defendants were <PERSON>Roland Matthews</PERSON>, president, and <PERSON>Peter Jonas</PERSON>, executive vice president and chief financial officer, as well as a former plant manager.
"The sharp stock market decline in late October appears to have had little or no effect on consumers," said <PERSON>Fabian Linden</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Conference Board</ORGANIZATION>'s consumer research center. "Survey returns received after the drop in the Dow Jones average were about the same as the views expressed prior to that event." 
The consumer confidence survey, covering 5,000 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> households, is conducted in the first two weeks of each month for the <ORGANIZATION>Conference Board</ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION>National Family Opinion Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, market researcher.
If you'd really rather have a <ORGANIZATION>Buick</ORGANIZATION>, don't leave home without the <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> card. 
<ORGANIZATION>American Express Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's beleaguered <ORGANIZATION>Buick</ORGANIZATION> division are joining forces in a promotion aimed at boosting <ORGANIZATION>Buick</ORGANIZATION>'s sales while encouraging broader use of the <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> card. 
The companies are giving four-day vacations for two to <ORGANIZATION>Buick</ORGANIZATION> buyers who charge all or part of their down payments on the <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> green card.
<ORGANIZATION>Buick</ORGANIZATION> approached <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> about a joint promotion because its card holders generally have a "good credit history" and are "good at making payments," says a spokeswoman for the division.
<PERSON>Phillip Riese</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> executive vice president, says the promotion with <ORGANIZATION>Buick</ORGANIZATION> is his company's first with an auto maker, but "hopefully {will be} the first of many" in the company's effort to promote its green card as "the total car-care card." To that end, <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> has been signing up gasoline companies, car repair shops, tire companies and car dealers to accept the card. 
Many auto dealers now let car buyers charge part or all of their purchase on the <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> card, but few card holders realize this, <PERSON>Mr. Riese</PERSON> says. 
Until now, however, buyers who wanted to finance part of a car purchase through <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Acceptance Corp.</ORGANIZATION> couldn't put their down payment on a charge card because of possible conflicts with truth-in-lending and state disclosure laws over finance rates, says a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> finance arm.
But <ORGANIZATION>GMAC</ORGANIZATION> approved the <ORGANIZATION>Buick</ORGANIZATION> program, he says, because the <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> green card requires payment in full upon billing, and so doesn't carry any finance rates. 
<PERSON>Mr. Riese</PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> considers <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Buick</ORGANIZATION> "very sophisticated direct-mail marketers," so "by joining forces with them we have managed to maximize our direct-mail capability." In addition, <ORGANIZATION>Buick</ORGANIZATION> is a relatively respected nameplate among <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> card holders, says an <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman.
When the company asked members in a mailing which cars they would like to get information about for possible future purchases, <ORGANIZATION>Buick</ORGANIZATION> came in fourth among <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> cars and in the top 10 of all cars, the spokeswoman says. 
<ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> has more than 24 million card holders in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, and over half have the green card.
<ORGANIZATION>GMAC</ORGANIZATION> screened the card-member list for holders more than 30 years old with household incomes over $45,000 who hadn't "missed any payments," the <ORGANIZATION>Buick</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman says.
A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Visa International</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> subsidiary says his company is using promotions to increase use of its cards, but doesn't have plans for a tie-in similar to the American Express-Buick link. 
Three divisions at <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> are working with <ORGANIZATION>Buick</ORGANIZATION> on the promotion: the establishment services division, which is responsible for all merchants and companies that accept the card; the travel division; and the merchandise sales division. 
Destinations are <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Miami Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Orlando</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>; and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>
Card holders who receive the letter also are eligible for a sweepstakes with <ORGANIZATION>Buick</ORGANIZATION> cars or a <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> vacation as prizes.
Under terms of the new proposal, <ORGANIZATION>Equus</ORGANIZATION>, managed by <ORGANIZATION>Equus Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, would pay $12 cash and one new preferred share with a liquidation preference of $1.65 a share for each of <ORGANIZATION>Tony Lama</ORGANIZATION>'s 2.1 million shares outstanding.
The <LOCATION>El Paso</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, maker of Western boots and leather accessories said the preferred stock would accrue dividends at a 12% rate, but wouldn't be paid for the first two years.
Neither <ORGANIZATION>Equus</ORGANIZATION> nor <ORGANIZATION>Tony Lama</ORGANIZATION> gave a reason for the changed offer and <ORGANIZATION>Tony Lama</ORGANIZATION> couldn't be reached for comment.
One analyst, <PERSON>Arthur Stevenson</PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, estimated that 65% or more of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s newly made automobiles run on alcohol and can't use gasoline. "This is a demand that must be met, regardless of the price of oil," said <PERSON>Mr. Stevenson</PERSON>. 
"It is these 645,000 tons that are in question for this crop year," explained <PERSON>Judith Ganes</PERSON>, analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. "Producers were granted the right earlier this year to ship sugar and the export licenses were expected to have begun to be issued" yesterday. 
More than a half of all sugar produced in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> goes for alcohol production, according to <PERSON>Ms. Ganes</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Thomas Oxnard</PERSON>, sugar analyst for <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Hackensack</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, said: "I am highly skeptical that <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> will curtail sugar exports, particularly with the price of sugar at over 14 cents a pound." 
<PERSON>Mr. Oxnard</PERSON> observed that the situation in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> is also very complicated.
The firmness in heating oil was attributed to colder weather in parts of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and to the latest weekly report by the <ORGANIZATION>American Petroleum Institute</ORGANIZATION>, which showed a decline in inventories of the fuel. 
As an indicator of the tight grain supply situation in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, market analysts said that late Tuesday the Chinese government, which often buys <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> grains in quantity, turned instead to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> to buy 500,000 metric tons of wheat.
Traders said prices also were supported by widespread rumors that the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> is on the verge of receiving most favored nation status from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
According to news service reports, most workers at the <LOCATION>Disputado mines</LOCATION> owned by <ORGANIZATION>Exxon Corp.</ORGANIZATION> agreed to a new two-year wage contract that includes a 5% increase and other benefits.
Separately, <ORGANIZATION>Reuter</ORGANIZATION> reported that the <LOCATION>Papua-New Guinea</LOCATION> government urged its Parliament to extend a state of emergency in copper-rich <LOCATION>Bougainville Island</LOCATION> for two months.
The <LOCATION>Bougainville</LOCATION> copper mine has been inoperative since May 15 because of attacks by native landowners who want <LOCATION>Bougainville</LOCATION> to secede from <LOCATION>Papua-New Guinea</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>RMS International Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Hasbrouk Heights</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, facing a cash-flow squeeze, said it is seeking other financing sources and waivers from debenture holders. 
Rated triple-A by both <ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor's Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the issue will be sold through underwriters led by <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc</ORGANIZATION>.

<ORGANIZATION>Santa Ana Community Redevelopment Agency</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION> -- $107 million of tax allocation bonds, 1989 Series A-D, due 1991-1999, 2009 and 2019, tentatively priced by a <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.</ORGANIZATION> group to yield from 6.40% in 1991 to 7.458% in 2019.
<ORGANIZATION>Maryland Community Development Administration</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Department of Housing and Community Development</ORGANIZATION> -- $80.8 million of single-family program bonds, 1989 fourth and fifth series, tentatively priced by a <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ORGANIZATION> group to yield from 6.25% in 1992 for fourth series bonds to 7.74% in 2029 for fifth series bonds.
<ORGANIZATION>Heiwado Co.</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>) -- $100 million of Eurobonds due Nov. 16, 1993, with equity-purchase warrants, indicating a 3 7/8% coupon at par, via <ORGANIZATION>Daiwa Europe Ltd</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Svenska Intecknings Garanti Aktiebolaget</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>) -- 20 billion yen of 6% Eurobonds due Nov. 21, 1994, priced at 101 3/4 to yield 6.03% less full fees, via <ORGANIZATION>Mitsui Finance International</ORGANIZATION>.

<ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Pencil Co.</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>) -- 60 million Swiss francs of privately placed convertible notes due Dec. 31, 1993, with a fixed 0.25% coupon at par via <ORGANIZATION>Union Bank of Switzerland</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Koizumi Sangyo Corp.</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>) -- 20 million Swiss francs of 6 1/2% privately placed notes due Nov. 29, 1996, priced at 99 1/2 via <ORGANIZATION>Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Schweiz</LOCATION>).
The worst crop damage occurred in the <LOCATION>Midwestern Corn Belt</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>northern Great Plains</LOCATION>.
To the surprise of some analysts, net cash income rose in some of the hardest-hit states, including <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Dakotas</LOCATION>.
At the same time, export demand for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> wheat, corn and other commodities strengthened, said <PERSON>Keith Collins</PERSON>, a department analyst.
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> led the nation with $6.5 billion in net cash income last year, followed by <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, $3.9 billion; <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, $3.4 billion; <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, $3.1 billion; and <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, $2.7 billion.
<LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> were among the few major farm states to log a decline in net cash income. 
<PERSON>Peter Marcus</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said that a downturn in the appliance industry, coupled with sluggish automotive sales, hurt <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> results.
The company attributed lower sales and earnings for the steel segment to the loss of results from the <LOCATION>Lorain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, plant, which now is a 50-50 joint venture with <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Kobe Steel Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 
Still, <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> fared better than other major steelmakers, earning more per ton of steel shipped than either <ORGANIZATION>Bethlehem Steel Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which posted a 54% drop in net income, or <ORGANIZATION>Inland Steel Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, whose profit plummeted 70%. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> shares closed up $1.25, at $34.625, as the reported earnings exceeded projections by some analysts who hadn't expected as great a volume of asset sales.
<PERSON>Charles Bradford</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> may have received orders lost by competitors who were involved in labor contracts earlier this year.
<ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> announced in October that it was soliciting bids to sell <ORGANIZATION>TXO</ORGANIZATION>'s oil and gas reserves. 
The announced sale of the reserves was followed by news that investor <PERSON>Carl Icahn</PERSON> had increased his stake in <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> to 13.1% and threatened a takeover or other business combination.
<PERSON>Mr. Icahn</PERSON> has said he believes <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> would be worth more if broken up into steel and energy segments.

Of the approximately 200 sponsors of the recent march in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> for the homeless, you chose to cite such groups as the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Home Builders</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen</ORGANIZATION>, insinuating that the march got its major support from self-serving groups that "know a good thing when they see it," and that the crusade was based on greed or the profit motive.
Why didn't you mention the <ORGANIZATION>YMCA</ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION>YWCA</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Charities USA</ORGANIZATION> or a hundred other nonprofit organizations that participated in the march? 
<LOCATION>Cullowhee</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION> 
Rep. <PERSON>John Dingell</PERSON>, an important sponsor of President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s clean-air bill, plans to unveil a surprise proposal that would break with the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> on a centerpiece issue: acid rain. 
The <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> Democrat's proposal, which is expected today, is described by government sources and lobbyists as significantly weaker than the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration's plan to cut utility emissions that lead to acid rain.
As chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>House Energy and Commerce Committee</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Dingell</PERSON> has almost single-handed control over clean-air legislation. 
<ORGANIZATION>Campbell Soup</ORGANIZATION> forced out its president and chief executive, <PERSON>R. Gordon McGovern</PERSON>, the strongest indication yet that the <PERSON>Dorrance</PERSON> family plans to take charge of reshaping the troubled food company.
Also, <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Phelan</PERSON> said he would support <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> halts of program trading during market crises but not any revival of a "collar" on trading. 
<ORGANIZATION>Georgia Gulf</ORGANIZATION> received a new takeover bid from investor <PERSON>Harold Simmons</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>NL Industries</ORGANIZATION> of $50 a share, or about $1.1 billion.

"Feeding Frenzy" (<ORGANIZATION>Henry Holt</ORGANIZATION>, 326 pages, $19.95), a highly detailed account of the <ORGANIZATION>Wedtech</ORGANIZATION> scandal, begins on a reassuring note. 
When offered a free trip from the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Wedtech</ORGANIZATION>'s home, to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, by one of <ORGANIZATION>Wedtech</ORGANIZATION>'s principals, he tells the reader, "mindful of accepting anything of value from those I was writing about, I declined." 
Bribe by bribe, <PERSON>Mr. Sternberg</PERSON> and his co-author, <PERSON>Matthew C. Harrison Jr.</PERSON>, lead us along the path <ORGANIZATION>Wedtech</ORGANIZATION> traveled, from its inception as a small manufacturing company to the status of full-fledged defense contractor, entrusted with the task of producing vital equipment for the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>. 
The book revolves around <PERSON>John Mariotta</PERSON>, the founder of the company, and <PERSON>Fred Neuberger</PERSON>, who became his partner soon after <ORGANIZATION>Wedtech</ORGANIZATION>'s creation.
Although started in 1965, <ORGANIZATION>Wedtech</ORGANIZATION> didn't really get rolling until 1975, when <PERSON>Mr. Neuberger</PERSON> discovered the federal government's Section 8(A) minority business program.
<PERSON>Mr. Neuberger</PERSON> realized that, although of Italian ancestry, <PERSON>Mr. Mariotta</PERSON> still could qualify as a minority person since he was born in <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>.
Instead of 50/50 it became, on paper only, two-thirds <PERSON>Mariotta</PERSON>, one-third <PERSON>Neuberger</PERSON>, and they were in the program and off to the races. 
Besides being a "minority-owned company" <ORGANIZATION>Wedtech</ORGANIZATION> was located in the <LOCATION>South Bronx</LOCATION>, a blighted area, made famous by <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON> in his 1976 presidential campaign.
The company plugged itself right into <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> campaign rhetoric about rebuilding the <LOCATION>South Bronx</LOCATION> and kept using the minority -- <LOCATION>South Bronx</LOCATION> angle through the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> '80s. 
Starting with Congressman <PERSON>Mario Biaggi</PERSON> (now serving a jail sentence), the company began a career of bribing federal, state and local public officials and those close to public officials, right up to and including <PERSON>E. Robert Wallach</PERSON>, close friend and adviser to former Attorney General <PERSON>Ed Meese</PERSON>.
It made ample use of the modern techniques of influence peddling, retaining politically connected "respectable" law firms, investment bankers and political consultants, including <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> confidant <PERSON>Lyn Nofzinger</PERSON>.
The one character at least somewhat interesting was <PERSON>Irving Louis Lobsenz</PERSON>, a pediatrician who changed his name to <PERSON>Rusty Kent London</PERSON> and became a master gambler and author of a book on blackjack.
Numerous other scandals, among them the ones at <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION>, have the same characteristics as <ORGANIZATION>Wedtech</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Stern</PERSON> was chairman and chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION>New York State Urban Development Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, 1983-85. 
<ORGANIZATION>Young's Market Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a wholesaler of spirits, wines and other goods, said it will merge with a new corporation formed by the <PERSON>Underwood</PERSON> family, which controls <ORGANIZATION>Young's</ORGANIZATION>. 
The record corn-buying binge by the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> is causing serious bottlenecks in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> grain pipeline. 
The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> bought roughly 310 million bushels of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> corn in October, which is the most ever sold to the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> in one month from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
But it is particularly difficult this autumn because of low water levels on the <LOCATION>Mississippi River</LOCATION>, on which flows much of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> corn that is shipped overseas. 
"We are shipping the most corn in that short of time period to one customer on record," said <PERSON>William Dunton</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> transportation expert. "It is going to be real tight." 
Because of persistent dry weather in the <LOCATION>northern Plains</LOCATION>, the water level on the upper section of the <LOCATION>Mississippi River</LOCATION> is so low that many river operators are already trimming the number of barges their tows push at one time. 
In a few weeks, many barges probably won't be able to operate fully loaded south of <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> because the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</ORGANIZATION> is beginning to reduce the flow of the <LOCATION>Missouri River</LOCATION>, which feeds into the <LOCATION>Mississippi River</LOCATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Army Corps</ORGANIZATION> is cutting the flow of the <LOCATION>Missouri River</LOCATION> about two weeks earlier than normal because of low water levels in the reservoirs that feed it. 
Barge rates on the <LOCATION>Mississippi River</LOCATION> sank yesterday on speculation that widespread rain this week in the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> might temporarily alleviate the situation. 
At <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, the water level of the <LOCATION>Mississippi River</LOCATION> is already 6.5 feet below normal and it could drop an additional 2.5 feet when the flow of the <LOCATION>Missouri River</LOCATION> is slowed, an <ORGANIZATION>Army Corps</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said.
Many farmers probably wouldn't sell until prices rose at least 20 cents a bushel, said <PERSON>Lyle Reed</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Central & Pacific Railroad Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Waterloo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>. 
Although <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> corn stockpiles shrank by roughly half in the wake of the drought, the <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> projects that nearly one-fifth of the harvest will still be in storage before the 1990 corn harvest begins. 
Some analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry's problems might spark investors to begin buying corn futures contracts -- only to see little appreciation. "The public is buying the market when in reality there is plenty of grain to be shipped," said <PERSON>Bill Biedermann</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Allendale Inc.</ORGANIZATION> research director. 
Although much of this country's export corn goes to <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> by barge, it is possible for exporters to sidestep the <LOCATION>Mississippi River</LOCATION> by shipping a larger-than-normal amount of corn by train to the port. 
Ports in the <LOCATION>Great Lakes</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Atlantic Coast</LOCATION> can also relieve pressure on <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>.
One railroad, for example, is already increasing its grain hauling service from <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>. 
Precious metals, gold in particular, currently are being influenced more by stock market gyrations than the dollar as traders seek greater investment stability, according to <PERSON>William O'Neill</PERSON>, vice president of research at <ORGANIZATION>Elders Futures</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. "The recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities," he said.
In <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>, workers at two copper mines, <LOCATION>Los Bronces</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>El Soldado</LOCATION>, which belong to the Exxon-owned <ORGANIZATION>Minera Disputada</ORGANIZATION>, yesterday voted to begin a full strike tomorrow, an analyst said.
The <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> report raised the possibility that the October survey of the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Purchasing Management</ORGANIZATION> would also show a reading above 50%. 
For six years, <PERSON>T. Marshall Hahn Jr.</PERSON> has made corporate acquisitions in the <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> mode: kind and gentle.
<PERSON>Mr. Hahn</PERSON>, the 62-year-old chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> is leading the forest-product concern's unsolicited $3.19 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION>Great Northern Nekoosa Corp</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION> has given the offer a public cold shoulder, a reaction <PERSON>Mr. Hahn</PERSON> hasn't faced in his 18 earlier acquisitions, all of which were negotiated behind the scenes. 
So far, <PERSON>Mr. Hahn</PERSON> is trying to entice <ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION> into negotiating a friendly surrender while talking tough. "We are prepared to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction," he says. 
If a competitor enters the game, for example, <PERSON>Mr. Hahn</PERSON> could face the dilemma of paying a premium for <ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION> or seeing the company fall into the arms of a rival. 
"There's a price above which I'm positive <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> has the courage not to pay," says <PERSON>A.D. Correll</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president for pulp and paper.
Says long-time associate <PERSON>Jerry Griffin</PERSON>, vice president, corporate development, at <ORGANIZATION>WTD Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>: "He isn't of the old school of winning at any cost." 
The decision to make the bid for <ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION>, for example, was made only after all six members of <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s management committee signed onto the deal -- even though <PERSON>Mr. Hahn</PERSON> knew he wanted to go after the company early on, says <PERSON>Mr. Correll</PERSON>.
Associates say <PERSON>Mr. Hahn</PERSON> picked up that careful approach to management as president of <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Polytechnic Institute</ORGANIZATION>.
Assuming that post at the age of 35, he managed by consensus, as is the rule in universities, says <PERSON>Warren H. Strother</PERSON>, a university official who is researching a book on <PERSON>Mr. Hahn</PERSON>.
That impressed <PERSON>Robert B. Pamplin</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive at the time, whom <PERSON>Mr. Hahn</PERSON> had met while fundraising for the institute.
In 1975, <PERSON>Mr. Pamplin</PERSON> enticed <PERSON>Mr. Hahn</PERSON> into joining the company as executive vice president in charge of chemicals; the move befuddled many in <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> who didn't believe a university administrator could make the transition to the corporate world. 
<PERSON>Mr. Hahn</PERSON> also has engineered a surprising turnaround of <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s sales climbed to $9.5 billion last year, compared with $6 billion in 1983, when <PERSON>Mr. Hahn</PERSON> took the reins.
Says <PERSON>Kathryn McAuley</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>First Manhattan Co.</ORGANIZATION>: "This is the greatest acquisition challenge he has faced." 
"The primary purpose of a railing is to contain a vehicle and not to provide a scenic view," says <PERSON>Jack White</PERSON>, a planner with the <ORGANIZATION>Indiana Highway Department</ORGANIZATION>.
In <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION>, the type F railing is being used to replace arched openings on the G Street Bridge.
<PERSON>Garret Boone</PERSON>, who teaches art at <ORGANIZATION>Earlham College</ORGANIZATION>, calls the new structure "just an ugly bridge" and one that blocks the view of a new park below. 
In <LOCATION>Hartford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, the Charter Oak Bridge will soon be replaced, the cast-iron medallions from its railings relegated to a park. 
Citizens in <LOCATION>Peninsula</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, upset over changes to a bridge, negotiated a deal: The bottom half of the railing will be type F, while the top half will have the old bridge's floral pattern. 
Similarly, highway engineers agreed to keep the old railings on the Key Bridge in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, as long as they could install a crash barrier between the sidewalk and the road. 
The event continues into next year and includes an exchange program to swap design teachers at <ORGANIZATION>Carnegie-Mellon</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Leningrad</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Mutchin Institute</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Dan Droz</PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION>Carnegie-Mellon</ORGANIZATION> group, sees benefits all around.
<PERSON>Mr. Droz</PERSON> says the Soviets could even help <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> designers renew their sense of purpose. "In <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, they kept asking us things like, `Why do you make 15 different corkscrews, when all you need is one good one? '" he says. "They got us thinking maybe we should be helping <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies improve existing products rather than always developing new ones." 
Besides, <ORGANIZATION>Eggers</ORGANIZATION> says, grain elevators are worth preserving for aesthetic reasons -- one famed architect compared them to the pyramids of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>. 
A number of cities -- including <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> -- have vacant grain elevators, <ORGANIZATION>Eggers</ORGANIZATION> says.
A medium-sized one in <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>, it says, could be altered to house up to 1,000 inmates at a lower cost than building a new prison in <LOCATION>upstate New York</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Leon J. Level</PERSON>, vice president and chief financial officer of this computer services concern, and <PERSON>F. Warren McFarlan</PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard University</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Graduate School of Business</ORGANIZATION>, were elected directors, increasing board membership to nine. 
Its plans to be acquired dashed, <ORGANIZATION>Comprehensive Care Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it plans to sell most of its psychiatric and drug abuse facilities in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and some other assets to pay its debt and provide working capital. 
In addition, the company has replaced its president and chief executive, naming <PERSON>W. James Nichol</PERSON>, head of the company's contract health services, to succeed <PERSON>B. Lee Karns</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr. Nichol</PERSON> said he was "extremely disappointed in the continuing deterioration of the company's operations while it attempted to conclude the reorganization during the past four months." Concurrent with <PERSON>Mr. Nichol</PERSON>'s appointment, <ORGANIZATION>Comprehensive Care</ORGANIZATION> moved its corporate headquarters from <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, to <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, where the company maintained its contract services offices. 
<ORGANIZATION>Comprehensive Care</ORGANIZATION> had agreed to be acquired by closely held <ORGANIZATION>First Hospital Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, but the sale sputtered almost from the beginning and finally collapsed last week. 
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Comprehensive Care</ORGANIZATION> closed at $3.75 a share, up 12.5 cents. 
At <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Nikkei</ORGANIZATION> index of 225 selected issues, which gained 132 points Tuesday, added 14.99 points to 35564.43. 
In early trading in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION>Nikkei</ORGANIZATION> index fell 63.79 points to 35500.64. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Tokyo Stock Price Index</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Topix</ORGANIZATION>) of all issues listed in the First Section, which gained 16.05 points Tuesday, was down 1.46 points, or 0.05%, at 2691.19. 
<PERSON>Akio Yamamoto</PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION>Nomura Investment Trust Management</ORGANIZATION>, said that if the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> federal funds rate declines to around 8.5%, institutions would acquire a clearer idea regarding the direction of the market and thus more comfortably participate in active buying.
<ORGANIZATION>Tokyu Group</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Estate</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Bridgestone/Firestone</ORGANIZATION>, which advanced Tuesday, declined on profit-taking.
<ORGANIZATION>Showa Shell</ORGANIZATION> gained 20 to 1,570 and <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Oil</ORGANIZATION> rose 50 to 1,500. 
<ORGANIZATION>Sumitomo Metal Mining</ORGANIZATION> fell five yen to 692 and <ORGANIZATION>Nippon Mining</ORGANIZATION> added 15 to 960. 
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> share prices were bolstered largely by continued gains on Wall Street and technical factors affecting demand for <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s blue-chip stocks. 
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> luxury auto maker being pursued by <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION>, gained 10 pence (16 cents) a share to close at 879 pence ($13.90).
Dealers said the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> government's decision Tuesday to waive its protective "golden share" in the auto maker raised prospects of a bidding war between the two <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auto giants. 
But the waiver also was seen as a signal that <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>, a major <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> auto industry employer, was able to gain government acceptance of its bid for control of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>B.A.T Industries</ORGANIZATION>, which is being pursued by Sir <PERSON>James Goldsmith</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Hoylake Investments</ORGANIZATION>, rose 9 to 753 on speculation that <ORGANIZATION>Hoylake</ORGANIZATION> will sweeten its bid, dealers said.
<ORGANIZATION>Reed International</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> publishing group, gained 15 to 397 despite reporting a 3.7% drop in interim pretax profit. 
Stocks boosted by market-makers shopping to cover book requirements in <ORGANIZATION>FT-SE</ORGANIZATION> 100 shares included <ORGANIZATION>Carlton Communications</ORGANIZATION>, which climbed 32 to 778. 
<ORGANIZATION>Glaxo</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION>'s largest pharmaceutical concern, advanced 23 to #14.13. 
Stock prices closed higher in <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> and lower in <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION> were closed for a holiday.
Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION>, were mixed in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>, lower in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> and little changed in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>.
Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> financier <PERSON>Saul Steinberg</PERSON> sought federal permission to buy more than 15% of <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>' parent, <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, saying he might seek control of the nation's second-largest airline. 
Although takeover experts said they doubted <PERSON>Mr. Steinberg</PERSON> will make a bid by himself, the application by his <ORGANIZATION>Reliance Group Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION> could signal his interest in helping revive a failed labor-management bid. 
Takeover stock traders were puzzled by the <ORGANIZATION>Reliance</ORGANIZATION> filing and cautioned that it doesn't mean <PERSON>Mr. Steinberg</PERSON> will definitely seek control. "Maybe he just wants to make something happen," said one takeover expert. 
One investment banker said <PERSON>Mr. Steinberg</PERSON> may be trying to position himself as a friendly investor who could help <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Stephen Wolf</PERSON> revive a failed labor-management bid.
<PERSON>Mr. Steinberg</PERSON>, he suggested, could replace <ORGANIZATION>British Airways PLC</ORGANIZATION>, which has withdrawn from the buy-out group. 
<ORGANIZATION>Reliance</ORGANIZATION> had already bought and sold <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stock at a big profit without making an antitrust filing before the collapse Oct. 13 of the $6.79 billion, $300-a-share labor-management buy-out.
<ORGANIZATION>Reliance</ORGANIZATION> acquired a 7% <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stake early this year at an average cost of $110 a share, and reduced its stake to 4.7% after <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> accepted the bid at prices higher than $282 a share. 
Market sources said <ORGANIZATION>Reliance</ORGANIZATION> has already sold its entire <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stake, and thus wouldn't have any reason to file the application simply to boost the value of its stock.
The filing adds a new twist to market speculation that <ORGANIZATION>Coniston Partners</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> money manager, has bought more than 5% of <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stock and may challenge the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> board's decision last week to remain independent.
<ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> wouldn't elaborate on a statement that it had been notified of the filing by <ORGANIZATION>Reliance</ORGANIZATION>.
Some takeover experts were skeptical, saying it was possible that <PERSON>Mr. Steinberg</PERSON> made the filing only to help boost the value of any remaining <ORGANIZATION>Reliance</ORGANIZATION> stake in <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Steinberg</PERSON> is thought to be on friendly terms with <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Wolf</PERSON>.
The investor was instrumental in tapping <PERSON>Mr. Wolf</PERSON> to run the air cargo unit of <ORGANIZATION>Tiger International Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Wolf</PERSON>'s success in that job helped him land the top job with <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> in December 1987. 
Due to an editing error, a letter to the editor in yesterday's edition from <PERSON>Frederick H. Hallett</PERSON> mistakenly identified the <ORGANIZATION>NRDC</ORGANIZATION>.
"This market's still going through its pains," said <PERSON>Philip Puccio</PERSON>, head of equity trading at <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities</ORGANIZATION>. "The psychology is still: `We want (stocks) up, but if they don't carry we're going to sell them. '" 
Trading is expected to remain subdued as the market awaits tomorrow's release of the jobs data with the hope that it will point toward a decline in interest rates. "I sense that some people are reluctant to stick their necks out in any aggressive way until after the figures come out," said <PERSON>Richard Eakle</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Eakle Associates</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Fair Haven</LOCATION>, 
<ORGANIZATION>Campbell Soup</ORGANIZATION> jumped 3 3/8 to 47 1/8 as the resignation of <PERSON>R. Gordon McGovern</PERSON> as president and chief executive officer sparked a revival of rumors that the company could become a takeover target.
<ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities</ORGANIZATION> boosted the stock's short-term investment rating in response to the departure; analyst <PERSON>John McMillin</PERSON> said he believes the company will turn to new management "that's more financially oriented." 
Other rumored takeover and restructuring candidates to attract buyers included <ORGANIZATION>Woolworth</ORGANIZATION>, which went up 1 3/4 to 59 1/2; <ORGANIZATION>Avon Products</ORGANIZATION>, up 1 3/4 to 29 1/4; <ORGANIZATION>Paramount Communications</ORGANIZATION>, up 2 to 57 7/8, and <ORGANIZATION>Ferro</ORGANIZATION>, up 2 5/8 to 28 3/4. 
<ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> climbed 1 3/4 to 73 1/8 amid rumors that <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> developer <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> was seeking financing to mount a new, lower offer for the parent company of <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert</ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON>Michael Derchin</PERSON> said he sees a 70% chance that the parent of <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, the target of a failed $300-a-share offer from a labor-management group, will be acquired or restructured within six months. 
<ORGANIZATION>Georgia Gulf</ORGANIZATION> added 1 3/4 to 51 1/4 after <ORGANIZATION>NL Industries</ORGANIZATION>, controlled by <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Harold Simmons</PERSON>, offered to acquire the stock it doesn't already own for $50 a share.
<ORGANIZATION>Great Northern Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION>, which surged 20 1/8 Tuesday after <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> launched a $3.18 billion offer for the company, dropped 1 3/8 to 61 1/2 in <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> composite trading of 5.1 million shares.
<ORGANIZATION>Mead</ORGANIZATION> rose 3/4 to 39 1/2, <ORGANIZATION>Federal Paper Board</ORGANIZATION> added 1/2 to 24 3/8 and <ORGANIZATION>Scott Paper</ORGANIZATION> gained 1/2 to 48 3/8, while <ORGANIZATION>International Paper</ORGANIZATION>> fell 7/8 to 48 7/8,>< Champion In< ternational lost 3/8 to 31 1/2 and <ORGANIZATION>Louisiana-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> dropped 1/8 to 40 1/4. 
<ORGANIZATION>Odyssey Partners Limited Partnership</ORGANIZATION>, an investment firm, completed the purchase of <ORGANIZATION>May Department Stores Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Caldor</ORGANIZATION> discount chain for $500 million plus the assumption of $52 million in debt. 
<LOCATION>Caldor</LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION>Norwalk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, operates 118 stores in the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION>; it reported revenue of $1.6 billion last year.
May Stores, <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, runs such well-known department stores as <ORGANIZATION>Lord & Taylor</ORGANIZATION>. 
But some analysts questioned how much of an impact the retirement package will have, because few jobs will end up being eliminated. "It's a cosmetic move," said <PERSON>Jonathan S. Gelles</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Wertheim Schroder & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Upjohn</ORGANIZATION> shares rose 87.5 cents to $38.875 apiece. 
Earnings at <ORGANIZATION>Xerox</ORGANIZATION>'s financial-services operations actually rose slightly, but that was largely because capital gains at <ORGANIZATION>Crum & Forster</ORGANIZATION> offset Hurricane Hugo payments and the reserves set up to cover future payments. 
Beginning in 1980, courts in several states including <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> decided to suspend the common-law rule that plaintiffs must prove that the defendants are the ones who are liable.
<ORGANIZATION>Lilly</ORGANIZATION>, where the highest <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> court expanded the market-share approach for the first time to say that drug makers that could prove <PERSON>Mindy Hymowitz</PERSON>'s mother didn't use their pill must still pay their share of any damages. 
But as <ORGANIZATION>Duke University</ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON>William Van Alstyne</PERSON> notes, by this reasoning a defendant could be held liable in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> for a bad apple even if he sold all his apples in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
The <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> justices noted that the fear of litigation already forced the only remaining anti-morning-sickness drug, Bendectin, off the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market. 
As liability expert <PERSON>Peter Huber</PERSON> tells us, after the <PERSON>Hymowitz</PERSON> case, if any drug maker introduces an anti-miscarriage drug "it's time to sell that company's stock short." We also know that the tort system is a lousy way to compensate victims anyway; some win the legal lottery, others get much less and contingency-fee lawyers take a big cut either way. 
We have no doubt this is one reason judges in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and justices on the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> are willing to trash the law in the DES cases.
The <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, a major futures marketplace, yesterday announced the addition of another layer of trading halts designed to slow program traders during a rapidly falling stock market, and the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> is expected today to approve some additional restrictions on program trading. 
<ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> stock specialists, in a bold palace revolt, began shortly after Oct. 13 to telephone the corporate executives of the companies whose stock is listed on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> to have them pressure the exchange to ban program trading. 
<PERSON>Charles Wohlstetter</PERSON>, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Contel Corp.</ORGANIZATION> who is rallying other CEOs to the anti-program trading cause, says he has received "countless" letters offering support. "They said universally, without a single exception: Don't even compromise.
Last week, <PERSON>Robert M. Bradley</PERSON>, one of the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s most respected floor traders and head of a major traders' organization, surrendered.
He sold his exchange seat and wrote a bitter letter to <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>John J. Phelan Jr.</PERSON> in which he said the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> is too focused on machines, rather than people.
At <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION>, and other big brokerage firms, stockbrokers battle their own firm's program traders a few floors away.
Corporations like <ORGANIZATION>Contel</ORGANIZATION> denounce program trading, yet <ORGANIZATION>Contel</ORGANIZATION> has in the past hired pension fund managers like <ORGANIZATION>Bankers Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION> that are also big program traders. 
But the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s leadership -- over the specialists' protests -- two weeks ago began trading a new stock "basket" product designed to facilitate program trading. "A lot of people would like to go back to 1970," before program trading, <PERSON>Mr. Phelan</PERSON> said this week. "I would like to go back to 1970.
They say greedy market manipulators have made a shambles of the nation's free-enterprise system, turning the stock market into a big gambling den, with the odds heavily stacked against the small investor. "The public didn't come to the market to play a game; they can go to Off-Track Betting for that," says <PERSON>A. Brean Murray</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Brean Murray, Foster Securities</ORGANIZATION>, a traditional money management firm. 
Critics like <PERSON>Mr. Murray</PERSON> "are looking for witches, and people who use computers to trade are a convenient boogieman," says <PERSON>J. Thomas Allen</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Advanced Investment Management Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> firm that runs a $200 million fund that uses index arbitrage. "Just a blind fear of the unknown is causing them to beg the regulators for protection." 
Like other forms of arbitrage, it merely seeks to take advantage of momentary discrepancies in the price of a single product -- in this case, a basket of stocks -- in different markets -- in this case the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> futures markets. 
The speed with which such program trades take place and the volatile price movements they can cause are what program trading critics profess to despise. "If you continue to do this, the investor becomes frightened -- any investor: the odd lotter, mutual funds and pension funds," says <PERSON>Larry Zicklin</PERSON>, managing partner at <ORGANIZATION>Neuberger & Berman</ORGANIZATION>. 
But many experts and traders say that program trading isn't the main reason for stock-market gyrations. "I have not seen one iota of evidence" to support restrictions on program trading, says a <ORGANIZATION>Vanderbilt University</ORGANIZATION> finance professor, <PERSON>Hans Stoll</PERSON>, an authority on the subject.
Says the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Phelan</PERSON>, "Volatility is greater than program trading." 
The Oct. 13 plunge was triggered not by program traders, but by news of the unraveling of the $6.79 billion buy-out of <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Unable to unload <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> and other airline shares, takeover-stock speculators, or risk arbitragers, dumped every blue-chip stock they had.
<PERSON>Susan Del Signore</PERSON>, head trader at <ORGANIZATION>Travelers Investment Management Co.</ORGANIZATION>, says critics are ignoring "the role the {takeover stock} speculator is taking in the market as a source of volatility." Many arbs are "overleveraged," she says, and they "have to sell when things look like they fall apart." 
And they believe the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>, under <PERSON>Mr. Phelan</PERSON>, has abandoned their interest.
They are still trying to lure back small investors spooked by the 1987 stock-market crash and the market's swings since then. "Small investors are absolutely dismayed that Wall Street is stacking the deck against them, and these wide swings are scaring them to death," says <PERSON>Raymond A. Mason</PERSON>, chairman of regional broker <ORGANIZATION>Legg Mason Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>.
Index traders who buy all 500 stocks in the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 often don't even know what the companies they own actually do, complains <PERSON>Andrew Sigler</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Champion International Corp.</ORGANIZATION> "Do you make sweatshirts or sparkplugs?
Among the top practitioners were Wall Street blue bloods: <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Kidder Peabody</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Group Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
Now, on a good day, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s stock-index traders trade more dollars worth of stock futures than the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> trades in stock. 
Program traders' "power to create total panic is so great that they can't be allowed to have their way," says Rep. <PERSON>Edward Markey</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> Democrat. "We have to have a system that says to those largest investors: `Sit down! You will not panic, you will not put the financial system in jeopardy. '" 
The <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s directors meet today to approve some program-trading restrictions, but a total ban isn't being considered, <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> officials say. 
<ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>John Phelan</PERSON> said yesterday that he could support letting federal regulators suspend program trading during wild stock-price swings.
In index arbitrage, the widget is the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500, and its price is constantly compared between the futures market in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> and the stock markets largely in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
To profit from an index-arbitrage opportunity, someone who owns the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 widget in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> must sell it and replace it with a cheaper <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 widget in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. 
An index-arbitrage trade is never executed unless there is sufficient difference between the markets in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> to cover all transaction costs.
Think about what causes the difference in prices between the two markets for <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 stocks -- usually it is large investors initiating a buy or sell in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. 
Arbitrage simply transfers his selling pressure from <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, while functioning as a buyer in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>.
Why does this large hypothetical seller trade in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> instead of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>?
If not <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, then in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>; if not the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, then overseas. 
<PERSON>Mr. Allen</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> firm, <ORGANIZATION>Advanced Investment Management Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, executes program trades for institutions. 
<ORGANIZATION>Allergan</ORGANIZATION> was spun off in July from <ORGANIZATION>SmithKline Beckman Corp.</ORGANIZATION> as part of the merger of <ORGANIZATION>SmithKline</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Beecham Group</ORGANIZATION> 
The funding mechanism, which has received congressional approval and is expected to be signed by President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, would affect the antitrust operations of the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Trade Commission</ORGANIZATION>. 
As a part of overall efforts to reduce spending, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> cut by $30 million the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration's request for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1.
Some Democrats, led by Rep. <PERSON>Jack Brooks</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>), unsuccessfully opposed the measure because they fear that the fees may not fully make up for the budget cuts. 
But <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>FTC</ORGANIZATION> officials said they expect the filing fees to make up for the budget reductions and possibly exceed them. "It could operate to augment our budget," <PERSON>James Rill</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>'s antitrust chief, said in an interview. 
Under measures approved by both houses of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, the administration's request for $47 million for the <ORGANIZATION>Antitrust Division</ORGANIZATION> would be cut $15 million.
Under that law, parties proposing mergers or acquisitions valued at $15 million or more must notify <ORGANIZATION>FTC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> antitrust regulators before completing the transactions.
Proponents of the funding arrangement predict that, based on recent filing levels of more than 2,000 a year, the fees will yield at least $40 million this fiscal year, or $10 million more than the budget cuts. "When you do that, there is not a cut, but there is in fact a program increase of $5 million" each for the <ORGANIZATION>FTC</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON>Neal Smith</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>) said during <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> debate. 
But Rep. <PERSON>Don Edwards</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>) responded that a recession could stifle merger activity, reducing the amount of fees collected.
The antitrust staffs of both the <ORGANIZATION>FTC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> were cut more than 40% in the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration, and enforcement of major merger cases fell off drastically during that period. "Today is not the time to signal that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in any way sanctions the dismal state into which antitrust enforcement has fallen," <PERSON>Mr. Edwards</PERSON> argued. 
<PERSON>David A. DiLoreto</PERSON>, president of metal container division, was named to the additional post of group vice president, packaging products, at this packaging, industrial and aerospace products concern, succeeding <PERSON>Delmont A. Davis</PERSON>, who was named president and chief operating officer in August. 
<ORGANIZATION>Heritage Media Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said it offered to buy the shares of <ORGANIZATION>POP Radio Corp.</ORGANIZATION> it doesn't already own in a stock swap. 
<ORGANIZATION>Heritage</ORGANIZATION>, which owns 51% of <ORGANIZATION>POP</ORGANIZATION>'s 3.6 million shares outstanding, said it will exchange one share of a new preferred stock for each <ORGANIZATION>POP</ORGANIZATION> common share it doesn't already own.
Depending upon how many warrants and options are exercised prior to completion of the transaction, <ORGANIZATION>Heritage</ORGANIZATION> would issue between 1.8 million and 2.35 million preferred shares, a <ORGANIZATION>Heritage</ORGANIZATION> spokesman estimated.
You now may drop by the <ORGANIZATION>Voice of America</ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and read the text of what the <ORGANIZATION>Voice</ORGANIZATION> is broadcasting to those 130 million people around the world who tune in to it each week.
The law let scholars, reporters and researchers read texts of <ORGANIZATION>VOA</ORGANIZATION> material, only at <ORGANIZATION>VOA</ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, but it barred them from copying texts.
For a funny thing happened on the way to the ruling: <ORGANIZATION>The United States Information Agency</ORGANIZATION>, which runs the <ORGANIZATION>Voice</ORGANIZATION>, changed its position on three key points. 
The word dissemination, it decided, referred only to itself. "The <ORGANIZATION>USIA</ORGANIZATION> officially and publicly declared the absolute right of everyone except the <ORGANIZATION>USIA</ORGANIZATION> to disseminate agency program materials in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>," my lawyer, the scholarly <PERSON>Mark McCormick</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Des Moines</LOCATION>, said in a memo pointing out the facts and trying to make me feel good after the press reported that I had lost.
The court noted the new <ORGANIZATION>USIA</ORGANIZATION> position but, just in case, officially found "that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> did not intend to preclude plaintiffs from disseminating <ORGANIZATION>USIA</ORGANIZATION> information domestically." 
-- The <ORGANIZATION>USIA</ORGANIZATION> said that, on reflection, anyone could view the <ORGANIZATION>VOA</ORGANIZATION> materials, not just the reporters, scholars, researchers and congressmen who are mentioned in the statute. "The <ORGANIZATION>USIA</ORGANIZATION> publicly and officially stated in the litigation that all persons are allowed access to the materials, notwithstanding the statutory designations, because the <ORGANIZATION>USIA</ORGANIZATION> has determined that it will not check the credentials of any person appearing and requesting to see the materials," <PERSON>Mr. McCormick</PERSON> noted. 
-- And the <ORGANIZATION>USIA</ORGANIZATION> said that all of us could take extensive notes. "The agency publicly and officially declared in the lawsuit that persons who examine the materials may make notes and, while the agency position is that persons may not take verbatim notes, no one will check to determine what notes a person has taken," <PERSON>Mr. McCormick</PERSON> reported. 
So now the situation is this: You have a right to read <ORGANIZATION>Voice of America</ORGANIZATION> scripts if you don't mind traveling to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> every week or so and visiting the <ORGANIZATION>Voice</ORGANIZATION> office during business hours.
Indeed, <PERSON>Judge O'Brien</PERSON> ruled that "it would be easy to conclude that the <ORGANIZATION>USIA</ORGANIZATION>'s position is `inappropriate or even stupid, '" but it's the law.
Section 501 of the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 says <ORGANIZATION>Voice</ORGANIZATION> material shall be available to certain of us (but now, thanks to the <ORGANIZATION>USIA</ORGANIZATION>'s new position, all of us) "for examination only." If those words weren't there, the nice people at the <ORGANIZATION>Voice</ORGANIZATION> would be able to send you the information or, at the very least, let you photocopy it. 
"You have . . . raised important questions which ought to be answered: What does <ORGANIZATION>USIA</ORGANIZATION> say about <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> abroad; how do we say it; and how can American taxpayers get the answers to these questions?" a man wrote me a couple of years ago.
<PERSON>Mr. Gartner</PERSON> is editor and co-owner of the <ORGANIZATION>Daily Tribune</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Ames</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, and president of <ORGANIZATION>NBC News</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
A <ORGANIZATION>House-Senate</ORGANIZATION> conference approved major portions of a package for more than $500 million in economic aid for <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> that relies heavily on $240 million in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal 1990 in hopes of stimulating future trade and investment. 
For the <ORGANIZATION>Agency for International Development</ORGANIZATION>, appropriators approved $200 million in secondary loan guarantees under an expanded trade credit insurance program, and total loan guarantees for the <ORGANIZATION>Overseas Private Investment Corp.</ORGANIZATION> are increased by $40 million over fiscal 1989 as part of the same <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> package. 
The agreement on <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill, which has already provoked veto threats by the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> and is sharply confined under this year's budget.
These fiscal pressures are also a factor in shaping the <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> package, and while more ambitious authorizing legislation is still pending, the appropriations bill in conference will be more decisive on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>. 
To accommodate the additional cash assistance, the <ORGANIZATION>House Appropriations Committee</ORGANIZATION> last week was required to reallocate an estimated $140 million from the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> are divided over whether the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> Population Fund will receive any portion of these appropriations, but the size of the increase is itself significant. 
The sweeping nature of the bill draws a variety of special interest amendments, running from an import exemption for a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> airplane museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s quota of exports to the profitable <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market. 
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> was stripped of this right because of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> differences with the <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> regime, but the Central American country would have received a quota of 30,537 metric tons over a 21-month period ending Sept. 30, 1990.
The potential sales are nearly $9.3 million, and <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Majority Whip <LOCATION>William Gray</LOCATION> (D., <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>) began the bidding this year by proposing language that the quota be allocated to English-speaking countries of the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>, such as <LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Barbados</LOCATION>.
Rep. <PERSON>Jerry Lewis</PERSON>, a conservative Californian, added a provision of his own intended to assist <LOCATION>Bolivia</LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> then broadened the list further by including all countries in the <LOCATION>U.S. Caribbean Basin</LOCATION> initiate as well as the Philippines-backed by the powerful <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> Democrat <PERSON>Sen. Daniel Inouye</PERSON>.
<LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION>, wary of upsetting its <LOCATION>Caribbean Basin</LOCATION> allies, has apparently instructed its lobbyist to abandon the provision initially drafted by <PERSON>Mr. Gray</PERSON>, but the greater question is whether <PERSON>Mr. Inouye</PERSON>, who has strong ties to the sugar industry, is able to insert a claim by the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>. 
The funding is attached to an estimated $27.1 billion transportation bill that goes next to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and carries with it a proposed permanent smoking ban on virtually all <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> domestic airline flights. 
The leadership hopes to move the compromise measure promptly to the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>, but in recent days, the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> has been as likely to bounce bills back to the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>.
The most recent example was a nearly $17.3 billion fiscal 1990 bill funding the <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Justice</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Commerce departments</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>First of America</ORGANIZATION>, which now has 45 banks and $12.5 billion in assets, announced an agreement to acquire the <LOCATION>Peoria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, bank holding company in January. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Midwest Financial</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary banks will continue to operate under their current names until early 1990, when each will adopt the <ORGANIZATION>First of America</ORGANIZATION> name. 
<LOCATION>Kalamazoo</LOCATION>, Mich.-based <ORGANIZATION>First of America</ORGANIZATION> said it will eliminate the 13 management positions of the former <ORGANIZATION>Midwest Financial</ORGANIZATION> parent company.
<ORGANIZATION>First of America</ORGANIZATION> said some of the managers will take other jobs with <ORGANIZATION>First of America</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Trinity Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it reached a preliminary agreement to sell 500 railcar platforms to <ORGANIZATION>Trailer Train Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>.
The <LOCATION>Rockford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, maker of fasteners also said it expects to post sales in the current fiscal year that are "slightly above" fiscal 1989 sales of $155 million.
THE HIGH-SCHOOL dropout rate in <LOCATION>Pope County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, is markedly lower than one stated in a page-one article Oct. 13, according to the area's high-school principal.
(See: "River of Despair: Along the Rich Banks of the Mississippi Live Poorest of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Poor --- They Endure a Lack of Jobs and <ORGANIZATION>Plantation Mentality</ORGANIZATION>, While Landowners Thrive --- <ORGANIZATION>Where Dreams of Blacks Die</ORGANIZATION>" -- WSJ Oct. 23, 1989) 
The <LOCATION>Dearborn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, energy company stopped paying a dividend in the third quarter of 1984 because of troubles at its <LOCATION>Midland</LOCATION> nuclear plant.
<ORGANIZATION>Charter One Financial Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a bank holding company, expects to report that third-quarter net income jumped 30% to $4.5 million, <PERSON>Charles John Koch</PERSON>, president and chief executive officer, said. 
Last year's figures have been restated to reflect the August 1989 mergers of <ORGANIZATION>Western Reserve Savings Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>First Federal Savings of Akron</ORGANIZATION> with Charter One.
<PERSON>Mr. Koch</PERSON> also said that <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>'s strong economy has helped Charter One, as well as other thrifts in the state.
In a year when scores of such institutions failed in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> and other states, <PERSON>Mr. Koch</PERSON> said only a few of <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>'s 221 thrifts have failed. "The institutions in <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> that failed were primarily those that made loans outside of <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>," he said. "Those that have succeeded have continued to lend in local areas." 
In addition to <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Akron</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>First Federal Savings</ORGANIZATION> also serves the <LOCATION>Youngstown</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Portsmouth</LOCATION> areas and in <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION> operates under the name of <ORGANIZATION>People's Savings</ORGANIZATION>. 
<LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> is nearing an agreement with its creditors on a plan for restructuring $1.8 billion of its commercial debt, a <ORGANIZATION>Bank of America</ORGANIZATION> executive said. 
<LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> is one of several debtor countries trying to buy back some of their loans under a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> initiative named after <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Nicholas Brady</PERSON>. 
Negotiations have been rushed in order to be completed in time for President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s trip to <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>, and the agreement is likely to be announced today.
"We are reasonably close to an agreement on a Brady-type plan for <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>," said <PERSON>Peter McPherson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Bank of America</ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president.
<ORGANIZATION>Bank of America</ORGANIZATION>, which chairs a committee representing <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>'s creditors, said the prospective plan would enable the country to buy back about $1 billion of debt at a "substantial discount." The repurchase is to be financed by fresh credits from the <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> and donor governments. 
<LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> also would be able to pay overdue interest on its still-outstanding loans at "more favorable terms" than regular debtors, other <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> bankers said. 
"Batibot," which started in 1983 as a hybrid of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> program "Sesame Street," has developed into a distinctly <LOCATION>Philippine</LOCATION> effort.
Filipino -- once known as <PERSON>Pilipino</PERSON> -- is predominantly <PERSON>Tagalog</PERSON>, the Malay-based language spoken in a part of the country's principal island of <LOCATION>Luzon</LOCATION>. 
But while better-off Filipinos are quick to cite the logic in using a language as widespread as English, they are often slow to reveal that they are prejudiced against <PERSON>Filipino</PERSON>, say advocates of the native language. "For the middle and upper-middle class {Filipino} is declasse," says <PERSON>Bien Lumbera</PERSON>, a Philippine-studies professor at <LOCATION>Quezon City</LOCATION>'s University of the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>. 
It is entrenched in the country's colonial bonds to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, in <LOCATION>Philippine</LOCATION> class structure, in the regional loyalties of its people and in its island geography.
As they did when the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> was a colony of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, teachers for the most part teach in English, even though it is a foreign language for most <LOCATION>Philippine</LOCATION> children.
There are only two large puppets in the program: <PERSON>Pong Pagong</PERSON> and a monkey named <PERSON>Kiko Matsing</PERSON>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Commodity Futures Trading Commission</ORGANIZATION> alleges that <PERSON>Mr. Monieson</PERSON> was warned that some brokers at his <ORGANIZATION>GNP Commodities Inc.</ORGANIZATION> were bilking investors and that he failed to stop them promptly.
His scheduled character witnesses at the Nov. 6 hearing include: <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Agriculture Secretary <PERSON>Clayton Yeutter</PERSON>, who was <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> president under <PERSON>Mr. Monieson</PERSON>; <PERSON>Leo Melamed</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION>'s executive committee, and <PERSON>Robert K. Wilmouth</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>National Futures Association</ORGANIZATION>, an industry-funded regulatory group. 
<PERSON>Mr. Monieson</PERSON>'s attorney in the matter is <PERSON>Jerrold E. Salzman</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION>'s influential outside counsel. 
<PERSON>Mr. Monieson</PERSON>, a childhood math whiz and self-described computer nerd, denies these charges and expects that he and <ORGANIZATION>GNP</ORGANIZATION> will be exonerated.
Noting that <ORGANIZATION>GNP</ORGANIZATION> processed some nine million trades last year, he says, "Who the (heck) would know what's going on with 50 trades out of nine million?" If he loses at the hearing, <PERSON>Mr. Monieson</PERSON> can appeal to the full panel of <ORGANIZATION>CFTC</ORGANIZATION> commissioners and then to the federal courts. 
Melamed, <PERSON>Salzman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Wilmouth</PERSON> came to their friend's aid despite the fact that the <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>National Futures Association</ORGANIZATION> brought similar failure-to-supervise charges against GNP, though not against <PERSON>Mr. Monieson</PERSON> personally. 
"The problem with self-regulation is always that the regulators are tinged with self-interest," says <PERSON>David Ruder</PERSON>, the just-departed chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>. 
One would counsel the avoidance of an appearance of a conflict." <PERSON>Mr. Ruder</PERSON> adds of <PERSON>Mr. Yeutter</PERSON>: "It seems odd that people in high government positions would intervene to testify." 
<PERSON>Mr. Salzman</PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> gave him permission to represent <PERSON>Mr. Monieson</PERSON>, adding there's no conflict because he has recused himself from the <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION>'s case. "I've had a long personal relationship with Brian," <PERSON>Mr. Salzman</PERSON> says. "I couldn't say no." 
<PERSON>Mr. Melamed</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Wilmouth</PERSON> both said they see no conflict because their organizations didn't charge <PERSON>Mr. Monieson</PERSON> personally, and they're only testifying to his character.
In an interview in his corner office in the <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> tower, <PERSON>Mr. Monieson</PERSON> contends he is a victim of his own celebrity. "The <ORGANIZATION>CFTC</ORGANIZATION> was looking for something high-profile," he says. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Board</ORGANIZATION>, which had to approve <ORGANIZATION>GNP</ORGANIZATION>'s sale to <PERSON>Banque Indosuez</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> bank, learned of the <ORGANIZATION>CFTC</ORGANIZATION> investigation. 
A distressed <PERSON>Mr. Monieson</PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION>CFTC</ORGANIZATION>, and asked its two top lawyers no fewer than five times to divulge confidential details of its probe into GNP.
They refused, even after <PERSON>Mr. Monieson</PERSON> warned that the deal's collapse would become an "international incident" between the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, according to a memo one of the lawyers wrote.
<PERSON>Mr. Monieson</PERSON>'s defense at the <ORGANIZATION>CFTC</ORGANIZATION> hearing will partly be that he is a busy man and wasn't personally involved in <ORGANIZATION>GNP</ORGANIZATION>'s retail brokerage business.
During his years as <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> chairman, 1983 through 1985, <PERSON>Mr. Monieson</PERSON> played host to prime ministers and crown princes; his attorneys have prepared charts showing the many <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> meetings he attended and the time he spent away on business.
<PERSON>Mr. Monieson</PERSON>, born on <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>North Side</LOCATION>, by age five was a faithful reader of the Racing Form, regularly joining his father at the track, he says.
Later, he bet the ponies with a high school friend, <PERSON>Myron Rosenthal</PERSON>, who would become his partner in <ORGANIZATION>GNP</ORGANIZATION> and other ventures. 
In 1965, he and <PERSON>Mr. Rosenthal</PERSON> set up what would become <ORGANIZATION>Indecon Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a computer processing firm.
<PERSON>Mr. Monieson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Rosenthal</PERSON> got together $50,000 and started trading pork belly futures at the <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> based on the program's predictions. 
They formed <ORGANIZATION>GNP</ORGANIZATION> in 1973 not out of any desire to run a futures clearing firm, <PERSON>Mr. Monieson</PERSON> says, but because they were tired of paying brokerage commissions. 
A decade later, <ORGANIZATION>GNP</ORGANIZATION> was trading all over the <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> floor, mostly in financial futures.
Yet pork bellies still held a fascination for <PERSON>Mr. Monieson</PERSON>, and his trading in that pit would earn him a dubious distinction: the only <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> chairman to be found guilty of committing trading violations while running the exchange. 
<PERSON>Mr. Monieson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Rosenthal</PERSON> were fined, $10,000 and $70,000 respectively, for taking speculative positions beyond the exchange's limits.
A company controlled by <PERSON>Mr. Monieson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Rosenthal</PERSON> lent the other traders more than $6.5 million to help finance the trades. 
One of the associates was <PERSON>Norman Furlett</PERSON>, a GNP salesman and one of <PERSON>Mr. Monieson</PERSON>'s closest friends.
What GNP didn't know was that <PERSON>Mr. Greenspon</PERSON> already was under investigation by the <ORGANIZATION>CFTC</ORGANIZATION> for alleged trade allocating at his previous firm.
The <ORGANIZATION>CFTC</ORGANIZATION> later concluded that <PERSON>Mr. Furlett</PERSON> had been allocating trades as well. 
According to separate <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> charges against the two men and <ORGANIZATION>GNP</ORGANIZATION>, which haven't been made public, during the first two months of 1986, accounts they maintained, including one named <ORGANIZATION>Horse Trading</ORGANIZATION>, had profits of $62,372.95.
<PERSON>Robert L. Sutermeister</PERSON>, a retired trucking company owner in <LOCATION>Dayton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, says he lost nearly all of the $10,000 he sent the brokers.
<PERSON>Larry Margler</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>McKinleyville</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Ca.</LOCATION>, engineer, says he lost about $3,000 of the $5,000 he turned over to <PERSON>Mr. Furlett</PERSON>. 
Between June 1985 and May 1986, the <ORGANIZATION>CFTC</ORGANIZATION> alleges, <PERSON>Mr. Monieson</PERSON> was warned by at least five <ORGANIZATION>GNP</ORGANIZATION> employees that <PERSON>Mr. Furlett</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Greenspon</PERSON> were defrauding customers.
After the <ORGANIZATION>Banque Indosuez</ORGANIZATION> deal collapsed in January 1987, the two salesmen left <ORGANIZATION>GNP</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Accor S.A.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> withdrew from an agreement to acquire a 51% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Greetings Group Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, an Australian hotel operator. 
A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Credit Lyonnais May Mellor Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, Accor's Australian financial adviser, said in a telephone interview that <PERSON>Accor</PERSON> "decided that the deal as originally structured wasn't suitable." 
In September, <ORGANIZATION>Accor</ORGANIZATION> entered into an option agreement with major shareholders of Greetings that would have given <PERSON>Accor</PERSON> a 51% stake through an issue of new shares. 
<PERSON>Mr. Grobstein</PERSON> had been a vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Ernst & Whinney</ORGANIZATION>, an accounting firm that merged with rival <PERSON>Arthur Young</PERSON> in July to form <ORGANIZATION>Ernst & Young</ORGANIZATION>, a major accounting, tax and management consulting firm.
Also, other firms including <ORGANIZATION>American Express Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ORGANIZATION> unit and <ORGANIZATION>Oppenheimer & Co.</ORGANIZATION> -- are debating whether to follow PaineWebber's lead and pull back from program trading. 
And <ORGANIZATION>Sears, Roebuck & Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</ORGANIZATION> unit, which used to be the 10th-biggest program trader on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, said it is sending a program-bashing letter to more than two million clients over the next month, among other actions that may include a nationwide advertising campaign. 
The criticism came to a head Tuesday when <ORGANIZATION>Kemper Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a big insurance and financial-services firm, cut off four Wall Street firms that engage in program trading -- Oppenheimer, <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Kidder, Peabody & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Bear, Stearns & Co.</ORGANIZATION> -- from getting any more of <PERSON>Kemper</PERSON>'s stock-trading business. 
Yesterday, another institutional investor -- <ORGANIZATION>Keystone Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> mutual-fund company -- said it will boycott firms that engage in index arbitrage.
"These firms, by using proprietary index-arbitrage trading techniques, have been competing with their own customers," said <PERSON>Albert H. Elfner III</PERSON>, president of <PERSON>Keystone</PERSON>. "Their actions can hurt long-term, fundamentally oriented investors, and have undermined public trust in the fairness of the markets." 
Another institutional investor, <ORGANIZATION>Penn Mutual Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, said it might join <PERSON>Kemper</PERSON> in avoiding program-trading brokerage firms.
Such companies as <ORGANIZATION>Keystone</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Kemper</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Penn Mutual</ORGANIZATION> are dependent on business from small investors, who have been peppering them with complaints about program trading and have retreated from the financial markets since the 1987 crash. 
But there's a chance we might," said <PERSON>David Wilson</PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION>Penn Mutual</ORGANIZATION>'s $100 million stock portfolio. "We are very upset about what has happened to the stock market.
<ORGANIZATION>Penn Mutual</ORGANIZATION> owns the regional brokerage firm <ORGANIZATION>Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>.
Yesterday, several officials from <LOCATION>Janney</LOCATION> visited the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> to lobby against program trading.
<PERSON>Donald B. Marron</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer, said the firm decided after the close of trading yesterday that it would stop doing index arbitrage for clients.
<ORGANIZATION>Goldman</ORGANIZATION>, which doesn't do index arbitrage for itself but does for customers, is concerned about the fallout. "Our corporate, institutional and individual clients are concerned about what they perceive to be excessive volatility," said <PERSON>Robert E. Mnuchin</PERSON>, senior partner in charge of <ORGANIZATION>Goldman</ORGANIZATION>'s equity trading. "We share their concern.
For the time being, <PERSON>James Wiess</PERSON>, an associate of <PERSON>Mr. Liptak</PERSON>'s, "is now our index arbitrager," said the spokesman. 
At <ORGANIZATION>Kidder Peabody</ORGANIZATION>, for example, the firm's leaders staunchly defend its aggressive use of index arbitrage for both <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION>'s own account and for customers.
Said <PERSON>Charles V. Sheehan</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION>'s managing director in charge of retail business: "To try to talk to {stockbrokers} about the virtues of program trading is like trying to talk about the virtues of nuclear power to the <ORGANIZATION>Audubon Society</ORGANIZATION>." He conceded "there is a little bit of a conflict there" between <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION>'s active program trading and its wooing of individual investors. 
There's a similar split at <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s 3rd-biggest program-trading firm.
Program trading is "scaring small investors away," said <PERSON>Michael Keyes</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Merrill</ORGANIZATION> broker in <LOCATION>Ogden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Richard Grasso</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> president, said "it's too early to reflect on the comments" made this week by <PERSON>Kemper</PERSON> and the other program-bashing firms.
When <PERSON>Kemper</PERSON> cut off four program-trading Wall Street firms from getting any of the big insurance and financial company's trading business, it complained that the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> has "vested interests" in its big member securities firms that engage in program trading. 
<PERSON>Christopher J. Chipello</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> contributed to this article. 
<PERSON>Yasumichi Morishita</PERSON>, whose art gallery last month became a major shareholder in <ORGANIZATION>Christies International PLC</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> auction house, is one man who doesn't fit the mold. 
Nearly 20 years ago, <PERSON>Mr. Morishita</PERSON>, founder and chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Aichi Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a finance company, received a 10-month suspended sentence from a <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> court for violating a money-lending law and an income tax law.
Christies says it has had no contact with <PERSON>Mr. Morishita</PERSON> since the stock purchase, but that it's happy to deal with him. "We like to make our own judgments" about <PERSON>Mr. Morishita</PERSON>, says <PERSON>Christopher Davidge</PERSON>, <PERSON>Christies</PERSON>' group managing director. "People have a different reputation country by country." 
<PERSON>Mr. Morishita</PERSON> is a leading figure among <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s 38,000 "machikin," which lend to small companies, and "sarakin," which lend to individuals.
But the interest rates they charge are often near <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s 54.75% legal limit, says <PERSON>Kenji Utsunomiya</PERSON>, a lawyer specializing in loan troubles. 
Last month, <PERSON>Mr. Morishita</PERSON>'s new gallery, <ORGANIZATION>Aska International Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, purchased 6.4% of Christies for #33 million ($53.3 million).
Acquired from <ORGANIZATION>Carisbrook Holdings U.K. Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a company owned by Australian financier <PERSON>Robert Holmes</PERSON> a Court, the stake was apparently the first of its kind for <LOCATION>Aska</LOCATION>, an entity separate from <LOCATION>Aichi</LOCATION>.
And the acquisition, which made <LOCATION>Aska</LOCATION> one of <ORGANIZATION>Christies</ORGANIZATION>' top five shareholders, left many people wondering who this man was and what his intentions were. 
"We're an investor," <PERSON>Mr. Morishita</PERSON> says, sitting back in his purple gallery filled with some 20 Monets and <ORGANIZATION>Renoirs</ORGANIZATION>. "In the long run, the {stock} prices will go up." It's not clear whether <ORGANIZATION>Aska</ORGANIZATION> plans to buy more shares.
A week ago, his gallery racked up a $23 million tab at a <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s auction in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> buying seven works, including a Picasso. 
"He makes snap judgments," says <PERSON>Kiyotaka Kori</PERSON>, the art gallery's manager and <PERSON>Mr. Morishita</PERSON>'s secretary for more than seven years. 
According to <ORGANIZATION>Teikoku Data Bank Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, which tracks company earnings, <ORGANIZATION>Aichi</ORGANIZATION>'s revenue rose 15% to 49.3 billion yen ($348.4 million) in the year ended February.
The <PERSON>Asahi Shimbun</PERSON>, a Japanese daily, last month reported that <LOCATION>Aichi</LOCATION> revised its tax calculations after being challenged for allegedly failing to report all of its income to tax authorities over a two-year period.
The <ORGANIZATION>Tokyo Regional Taxation Office</ORGANIZATION> declines to comment, and <PERSON>Mr. Kori</PERSON>, the tycoon's secretary, says the problem simply resulted from a difference of opinion over what was considered income. 
Stretching his arms in his silky white shirt and squeaking his black shoes, he lectures a visitor about the way to sell <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> real estate and boasts about his friendship with <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON>'s son. 
The seventh child of a store owner in <LOCATION>Aichi</LOCATION> prefecture, <PERSON>Mr. Morishita</PERSON> started out in the textile business.
He also owns courses in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. 
Even in <LOCATION>Denenchofu</LOCATION>, one of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s richest neighborhoods, <PERSON>Mr. Morishita</PERSON>'s splashy brick manor -- one of some 10 houses he owns -- outshines the neighbors'.
He'll be there wherever there's money to be made, laughs <PERSON>Mr. Kori</PERSON>, the secretary. "Who knows," he says, "if he heard that soybeans make money today, he might be flying out to <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> tomorrow." 
The debt reduction is expected to save the <LOCATION>Fort Lauderdale</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION> home video concern about $2 million a year in interest expense.
<ORGANIZATION>Indosuez</ORGANIZATION> said it has agreed to purchase <PERSON>Willis Faber</PERSON> <ORGANIZATION>PLC</ORGANIZATION>'s 20.4% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Grenfell</ORGANIZATION>, by far the largest single holding in the bank.
That would bring <LOCATION>Indosuez</LOCATION>'s total stake to 24.8%, <ORGANIZATION>Indosuez</ORGANIZATION> said. 
While awaiting <ORGANIZATION>Bank of England</ORGANIZATION> permission to pass the 15% mark, <PERSON>Indosuez</PERSON> said, it has agreed to purchase immediately a 10.5% share in the bank for 410 pence ($6.62) a share, bringing its stake to 14.9%.
<ORGANIZATION>Morgan Grenfell</ORGANIZATION> shares jumped 38 pence to 400 pence on <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s stock exchange. 
<ORGANIZATION>Indosuez</ORGANIZATION> said it has agreed that, barring a major change in <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Grenfell</ORGANIZATION>'s situation, it won't launch a full takeover bid for at least a year.
But despite signs that <PERSON>Morgan Grenfell</PERSON> staff was unhappy at the sudden investment, <ORGANIZATION>Indosuez</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani</PERSON> said he will begin linking the two banks into "an important merchant banking group in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>." 
In a telephone interview, <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Grenfell</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>John Craven</PERSON> said the <LOCATION>Indosuez</LOCATION> holding "wasn't one that was taken at our initiative," adding that <PERSON>Morgan Grenfell</PERSON> "remains perfectly confident in the future of our business as an independent entity." 
<PERSON>Mr. Craven</PERSON> added he held "important discussions" yesterday with <LOCATION>Indosuez</LOCATION> officials about the possible benefits of a combination, and that <PERSON>Morgan Grenfell</PERSON>'s attitude "is entirely objective." He added: "My understanding of what I have heard is that their intentions are very long term.
In a statement, <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Grenfell</ORGANIZATION> said it now seeks further clarification of <LOCATION>Indosuez</LOCATION>'s intentions. 
<PERSON>Mr. Jeancourt-Galignani</PERSON> refused to say whether <PERSON>Indosuez</PERSON> will bid for all of <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Grenfell</ORGANIZATION> when its year is up.
It would catapult Indosuez from the position of a marginal <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> player, with strong <LOCATION>Asian</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Middle Eastern</ORGANIZATION> activities, to the upper levels of the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> merchant banking scene.
It is part of <LOCATION>Indosuez</LOCATION>'s overall plan of building its business across <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, as the 1992 reduction of European Community market barriers looms. 
<PERSON>Mr. Jeancourt-Galignani</PERSON> said <PERSON>Indosuez</PERSON> had to move fast because it feared that another investor -- widely rumored to be <ORGANIZATION>Deutsche Bank</ORGANIZATION> -- was buying shares heavily.
<ORGANIZATION>Indosuez</ORGANIZATION> said it believes <ORGANIZATION>Deutsche Bank</ORGANIZATION> currently has a 4.9% stake, but it refused to say who it believed was buying.
"The logic is that <LOCATION>Indosuez</LOCATION> is a French investment bank with a lot of market activities, but not a lot of fund management," said <PERSON>Romain Burnand</PERSON>, a financial analyst at <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> brokerage <ORGANIZATION>Cholet-Dupont & Cie.</ORGANIZATION> 
He said <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Grenfell</ORGANIZATION> manages about #7 billion pounds ($11.3 billion) in investment funds. "It is a force in the market and has a very good international image," <PERSON>Mr. Burnand</PERSON> said. "The problem is that executives are volatile.
<LOCATION>Hercules</LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION>Wilmington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Del.</LOCATION>, said it has received "numerous unsolicited inquiries" over the last 18 months about the unit's availability.
The missing funds -- and the way they've been accounted for -- are at the center of a long-running dispute between the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> aerospace company and a well-connected Korean enterprise called <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Culture Travel Development Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
Since news of <ORGANIZATION>Northrop</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Korean</LOCATION> dealings became public last year, the company has insisted that it sunk the money into a proposed hotel venture in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>, losing everything when it was bamboozled by Korean con men.
The Koreans say that the hotel was a ruse from the beginning, and <ORGANIZATION>Northrop</ORGANIZATION> really intended to bribe government officials to buy its ill-fated F-20 <ORGANIZATION>Tigershark</ORGANIZATION> jet fighter. 
Now, a document released by the <ORGANIZATION>House Energy and Commerce</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee alleges that <ORGANIZATION>Northrop</ORGANIZATION> tried to cover up those purportedly illicit payments by forging signatures, shuffling millions of dollars in and out of banks and even paying hush money to middlemen who threatened to disclose the scam to the authorities. 
But the document -- featuring a passel of new details -- is sure to revive interest in the matter on <LOCATION>Capitol Hill</LOCATION>, where lawmakers this week are deciding on appropriations for <ORGANIZATION>Northrop</ORGANIZATION>'s most important Pentagon program, the B-2 Stealth bomber.
<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> Culture Travel submitted the document as part of its legal defense to the <ORGANIZATION>International Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>, which is arbitrating the case between <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Culture Travel</ORGANIZATION> and Northrop. 
One subcommittee investigator, who works for Chairman <PERSON>John Dingell</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>), called the information "a major step forward" in its own inquiry.
In a May 8 filing to the chamber, though, <ORGANIZATION>Northrop</ORGANIZATION> stressed its view that "this is not a complex case . . . but is instead a straightforward breach-of-contract dispute." The company added that <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> Culture Travel's "allegations are so contradictory and inconsistent that they provide powerful evidence" that the Koreans "deceived Northrop" by pitching the hotel project. 
<ORGANIZATION>Northrop</ORGANIZATION>'s first contact with the Koreans, this version of the tangled events goes, occurred in the summer of 1983 when <ORGANIZATION>Northrop</ORGANIZATION> approached <ORGANIZATION>Dong Yang Express Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a bus company that was run by <PERSON>Lee MinHa</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr. Park</PERSON>, the pistol-packing owner of a notorious <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> night spot called the <ORGANIZATION>Safari Club</ORGANIZATION>, was a member of the <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> Olympic Organizing Committee with easy access to the highest echelons of the <LOCATION>Korean</LOCATION> government. 
The brief alleges that <PERSON>Northrop</PERSON>, by way of a Honolulu-based consultant named <PERSON>James Shin</PERSON>, proposed the idea of selling to <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> as many as 200 F-20s through <ORGANIZATION>Dong Yang Express</ORGANIZATION>, which was to receive a 2% commission with a $55 million cap.
As part of the arrangement, the document contends, <ORGANIZATION>Northrop</ORGANIZATION> was asked to invest in the <LOCATION>Sofitel Seoul</LOCATION>, "a high-class hotel" that was to be built on the site of a <ORGANIZATION>Dong Yang Express</ORGANIZATION> garage. 
Though it is typical for <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> companies to invest in foreign countries in which they want to trade arms, thereby offsetting the cost of currency conversion on its contracts to the overseas government, it was still initially puzzling why <ORGANIZATION>Northrop</ORGANIZATION> approached a bus company to do it. 
"I first thought it made no sense to offer to an express bus company the distribution of up-to-date fighters," <PERSON>Mr. Lee</PERSON> told public prosecutors in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> who have also investigated the situation, according to the document. "But later I learned that it was not <ORGANIZATION>Dong Yang Express</ORGANIZATION> but <PERSON>Mr. Park Chong Kyu</PERSON> that Northrop aimed to contact." 
In May 1984, the document asserts, <ORGANIZATION>Northrop</ORGANIZATION> officials met with <PERSON>Mr. Park</PERSON> -- known best to Americans as C.K. Park -- and allegedly asked him to "perform promotional activities" for the F-20.
The brief says <PERSON>Mr. Park</PERSON> then asked for $5 million up front, adding that "he could procure such expenses from the budget for the Sofitel Hotel project if approved by <PERSON>Northrop</PERSON>." 
But <PERSON>Northrop</PERSON> declined, the brief says, when its representatives pointed out that a payoff would be illegal and "such a payment, if done, would constitute a scandal." Yet the document alleges that it didn't take long before <ORGANIZATION>Northrop</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Mr. Park</PERSON> devised a new scheme to funnel the money.
Promotional materials touting <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> Culture Travel were delivered to <LOCATION>Northrop</LOCATION> and appear to have been signed by <PERSON>Kang Oh-Hyun</PERSON>, an official of the firm; in fact, the filing alleges, they were forged by <PERSON>Mr. Shin</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Northrop</ORGANIZATION> consultant.
The brief says other procedural forms relating to the joint venture appear to have been signed by four <ORGANIZATION>Asia Culture Travel</ORGANIZATION> shareholders when <PERSON>Mr. Park</PERSON> came to <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> in the summer of 1984 for the Olympic Games.
On Aug. 9, 1984, <PERSON>Northrop</PERSON> told <PERSON>Mr. Park</PERSON> that $6,250,000 had been deposited to an account in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> that he controlled.
Shortly thereafter another F-20 crashed in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> during a demonstration, and <ORGANIZATION>Northrop</ORGANIZATION> eventually gave up on the F-20 program after out-of-pocket expenditures of more than $1 billion.
Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Northrop</ORGANIZATION>'s own board began inquiring about what happened to the hotel -- the <LOCATION>Seoul Palace</LOCATION>, it was to be called -- and the $6,250,000.
First, the brief says, <ORGANIZATION>Northrop</ORGANIZATION> wanted to formally cancel with <ORGANIZATION>Dong Yang Express</ORGANIZATION> the earlier <ORGANIZATION>Sofitel Hotel</ORGANIZATION> transaction that had been proposed.
<PERSON>Donald Foulds</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Northrop</ORGANIZATION> executive, even allegedly drafted the settlement claim for <ORGANIZATION>Dong Yang Express</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Foulds</PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON>Jan Handzlik</PERSON>, said his client "denies that he engaged in any improper activity in respect to the <LOCATION>Korean</LOCATION> hotel project, including any cover-up activities." 
That money, investigators for the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee said, was in turn designed to be handed back to <LOCATION>Northrop</LOCATION> to help it account for more than half of the missing $6,250,000.
But, the filing says, that plan had to be killed when "the blackmailers appear." The first allegedly was a <ORGANIZATION>Dong Yang Express</ORGANIZATION> middleman, who told <PERSON>James Dorsey</PERSON>, a Honolulu-based <ORGANIZATION>Northrop</ORGANIZATION> marketing executive, that he would "publish all the facts concerning <ORGANIZATION>Northrop</ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to sell the F-20 to the <LOCATION>Korean</LOCATION> government," the document says.
Both <PERSON>Mr. Dorsey</PERSON> and his lawyer, <PERSON>Daniel Bookin</PERSON>, declined to comment. 
<PERSON>Welko Gasich</PERSON>, then a top <ORGANIZATION>Northrop</ORGANIZATION> executive, allegedly handed over $1.5 million to <ORGANIZATION>Dong Yang Express</ORGANIZATION>, which passed on $500,000 to silence the middleman, the document claims.
<PERSON>Mr. Shin</PERSON>, who is being sued by <ORGANIZATION>Northrop</ORGANIZATION> in federal court in <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>, couldn't be reached. 
It was then that <ORGANIZATION>Northrop</ORGANIZATION> filed suit against the Koreans -- in what the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> investigators claim was an attempt to make it look as if <PERSON>Northrop</PERSON> had been swindled. 
The company is asking the <ORGANIZATION>International Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION> to order <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> Culture Travel and its associates to return the $6,250,000, plus interest "at the highest lawful rate." 
After more than a year of losing accounts and watching its reputation slide, <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy & Mather</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> office hired away a top creative executive from flashy Chiat/Day/Mojo as its creative head. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of London-based <ORGANIZATION>WPP Group</ORGANIZATION>, named <PERSON>Bill Hamilton</PERSON>, 47, to the top creative post in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Hamilton</PERSON> had been an executive vice president and creative head of Chiat/Day's <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> office, known for its funky work for Arrow shirts, <ORGANIZATION>Nynex</ORGANIZATION> yellow pages and <PERSON>Anne Klein II</PERSON>.
At <LOCATION>Ogilvy</LOCATION>, he succeeds <PERSON>Norman Berry</PERSON>, who left the agency in June but now plans to return to the parent company, <ORGANIZATION>WPP</ORGANIZATION>. 
Chiat/Day said <PERSON>Lee Clow</PERSON>, the agency's president and chief creative director, will fill in as acting <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> creative director until the naming of <PERSON>Mr. Hamilton</PERSON>'s successor -- or possibly successors -- within the next few weeks. 
<PERSON>Mr. Hamilton</PERSON> faces a daunting task in reviving <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy</ORGANIZATION>'s stagnant <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> office.
The office is suffering from "a dead battery," as <PERSON>Alan Gottesman</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION>, puts it.
<ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy</ORGANIZATION> last spring hired <PERSON>Michael Lesser</PERSON>, 47, from <PERSON>Lowe Marschalk</PERSON> to head up the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> operations, but <PERSON>Mr. Lesser</PERSON> hasn't had a strong creative leader to work with him. 
But they questioned whether there might be a culture clash between buttoned-up <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Mr. Hamilton</PERSON>, an 11-year veteran of Chiat/Day's freewheeling, no-walls-no-doors culture.
<PERSON>Mr. Hamilton</PERSON>, after all, presided over -- among other things -- the weird <ORGANIZATION>U.B.U. Reebok</ORGANIZATION> campaign while at Chiat/Day.
Ogilvy creates more-mainstream ads for clients including <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Seagram</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Hamilton</PERSON> talked broadly of some of the changes he'd like to make at <LOCATION>Ogilvy</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Hamilton</PERSON> also said he might also bring over some Chiat/Day veterans, though from <LOCATION>non-New York</LOCATION> offices. 
<PERSON>Mr. Hamilton</PERSON> accepted the job after repeated discussions not just with <PERSON>Mr. Lesser</PERSON>, but with <ORGANIZATION>WPP Group</ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer, <PERSON>Martin Sorrell</PERSON>, who has taken a hands-on approach with his acquisition. "I probably wouldn't have accepted the job had it not been the combination of Mike {Lesser} and <PERSON>Martin</PERSON>," he said. 
A <ORGANIZATION>Kraft General Foods</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said <PERSON>Margeotes</PERSON> has been given an assignment to do "some development work on a venture project." Executives close to the <LOCATION>Glenview</LOCATION>, Ill.-based food giant said the work is for a new coffee beverage product currently in development. 
<PERSON>Margeotes</PERSON>, whose clients include <PERSON>Godiva</PERSON> and <PERSON>Maccabee</PERSON> beer, has had a string of new business wins.
Separately, the <ORGANIZATION>Kraft General Foods</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said it selected D'Arcy <ORGANIZATION>Masius Benton & Bowles</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, to handle its Sealtest Free non-fat ice cream account.
LINTAS LAYOFFS: About 20 people were laid off at <ORGANIZATION>Lintas</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ceco Communications</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary in <LOCATION>Warren</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, on Tuesday.
<PERSON>Dick O'Connor</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <LOCATION>Lintas</LOCATION>:Campbell-Ewald, said the office isn't growing as expected. 
As expected, <ORGANIZATION>First Interstate Bancorp</ORGANIZATION> reported a net loss of $15.5 million for its third quarter because of hemorrhaging at its <ORGANIZATION>First Interstate Bank of Arizona</ORGANIZATION> unit. 
In yesterday's report, <ORGANIZATION>First Interstate</ORGANIZATION> said its bank in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> also reported a loss of $23.5 million for the quarter.
But it said that its consumer banks in <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> performed well during the quarter and that nonperforming assets at these banks declined by 14% over the year-ago period. 
Under buyer <ORGANIZATION>Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which acquired the food and tobacco giant for $25 billion in February, <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION> has kept pace with an ambitious schedule to pare its massive debt load.
And rumors resurfaced yesterday that <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION>'s planned $1.48 billion sale of its <ORGANIZATION>Del Monte</ORGANIZATION> canned foods unit might fall through. 
"We're acting like we're not an <ORGANIZATION>LBO</ORGANIZATION> company," said a beaming <PERSON>Louis Gerstner Jr.</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer. 
Much of <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION>'s financing for the <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION> buy-out is with so-called payment-in-kind debt, notes that accumulate interest in more notes and don't require cash payments for several years.
Although <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION> is having no trouble meeting cash-interest payments, it is too early to tell just how onerous the high-interest <ORGANIZATION>PIK</ORGANIZATION> notes will be once they come due. 
Yesterday, prices of <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION>'s high-yield junk bonds fell on rumors of problems with the <ORGANIZATION>Del Monte</ORGANIZATION> deal.
"Everything had gone well until the junk market went into disarray," said <PERSON>David Goldman</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Nomura Securities International Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "But from this point forward, I think the jury is definitely out." 
Its brands are battered by <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris Cos.</ORGANIZATION>, and it is still unclear whether <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> will be able to afford the major overhaul to turn that business around. 
<ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION> operating income from food soared 31% in the six months, paced by 40% growth at its <ORGANIZATION>Nabisco Brands</ORGANIZATION> unit. 
<ORGANIZATION>Nabisco</ORGANIZATION> has cut costs aggressively, according to <PERSON>John Greeniaus</PERSON>, the unit's chief executive.
<PERSON>Mr. Greeniaus</PERSON> also says <ORGANIZATION>Nabisco</ORGANIZATION>, following the lead of competitors, has been "relatively aggressive" in raising prices. 
The unit's <ORGANIZATION>Teddy Grahams</ORGANIZATION> snack food has surged to become the industry's third-selling cookie in less than a year on the market, behind <ORGANIZATION>Nabisco</ORGANIZATION>'s own <ORGANIZATION>Oreos</ORGANIZATION> and Chips Ahoy! brands.
<PERSON>Mr. Greeniaus</PERSON> put <ORGANIZATION>Teddy Grahams</ORGANIZATION>' first-year sales at just under $150 million, which he called "unprecedented." Last month, <PERSON>Nabisco</PERSON> brought out a dozen more new products. 
Next year, <PERSON>Mr. Greeniaus</PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION>Nabisco</ORGANIZATION>'s operating income should climb 15% -- down from the expected 40% growth this year but above the 10% level considered strong in the industry. 
<ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION>'s asset sales will be on schedule, too -- if the <ORGANIZATION>Del Monte</ORGANIZATION> deal is successful.
It expects to pay that with roughly $1 billion in sales of assorted small assets (probably including its 20% stake in <ORGANIZATION>ESPN</ORGANIZATION>, its Butterfinger and <PERSON>Baby Ruth</PERSON> candy bar brands, and its breakfast cereals unit) and $2 billion from the two-part sale of most of <ORGANIZATION>Del Monte</ORGANIZATION>.
A group led by <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION> agreed to acquire <PERSON>Del Monte</PERSON> last month, but the agreement is contingent on the securities firm's ability to finance about $350 million of the purchase price, either by selling junk bonds or making a bridge loan. 
If it doesn't go through, that could force <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> to adjust the terms of the sale or to sell other assets, including <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION>'s food units in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>, the hot-cereals division, or even the Planter's <ORGANIZATION>LifeSavers</ORGANIZATION> unit, to meet the bank debt pay-down time-table. 
Neither Merrill, <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION> nor <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> would comment yesterday on the deal. 
Several people familiar with the agreement said <ORGANIZATION>Merrill</ORGANIZATION> hasn't told <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION> of any decision not to proceed with the purchase.
<PERSON>Karl von der Heyden</PERSON>, chief financial officer, said he is talking with bankers about refinancing between $2.5 billion and $3 billion of <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION> loans at lower interest rates, possibly securing the refinanced debt with some of <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION>'s assets. 
Some time before April 1991, <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION> must fix the interest rates on $5.8 billion worth of <ORGANIZATION>PIK</ORGANIZATION> bonds so the notes trade at par, in accordance with the bonds' terms.
If <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION> does have to raise rates significantly on the <ORGANIZATION>PIK</ORGANIZATION> debt, it won't cost the company cash for several years.
As the transaction was originally structured, about one-third of the <ORGANIZATION>PIK</ORGANIZATION> debt is due to convert into a 25% stake of <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION> equity in 1993, unless 90% of the bond holders decide against conversion.
"The higher the reset, the greater the share of the return on equity will accrue to bondholders as opposed to equity holders," said <PERSON>Robert Long</PERSON>, a bond analyst with <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION>'s executives say they aren't concerned about the troubled junk-bond market yet. "We certainly wouldn't want to reset those bonds today," said <PERSON>Mr. von der Heyden</PERSON>. "If the markets don't recover, it will be costly.
"I really don't worry about what happens in the bond market from day to day, or even week to week," added <PERSON>Mr. Gerstner</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman. "I think our paper has been well received.
It said it plans to file the share offer with the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Amsterdam Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> "within the next few weeks." It didn't elaborate. 
The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> joined the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> in making federal reparations for Japanese-Americans held in World War II internment camps a legal entitlement requiring the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury Department</ORGANIZATION> to meet expedited payments of an estimated $1.25 billion during the next several years. 
The 249-166 roll call came as the chamber approved a compromise bill allocating $17.2 billion to the departments of State, <ORGANIZATION>Justice</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> in fiscal 1990 and imposing increased fees on business interests making filings with the government. 
An estimated $40 million would come annually from a new $20,000 charge on pre-merger notifications to the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> filing fees would rise by 25% to fund a $26 million increase in the agency's budget. 
Yesterday's vote on <LOCATION>Japanese-American</LOCATION> reparations ensures final enactment of the entitlement provision, which abandons earlier efforts to find offsetting cuts but is seen as a more realistic path to expediting compensation first authorized in 1988. "The only way to reduce the costs is to say we don't want to pay the bill," said Rep. <PERSON>Neal Smith</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>), who taunted President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s party to back up his campaign promise of supporting the claims of $20,000 per individual. "Read my lips," said <PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON>. "If you're for paying the claims . . . I don't know how anyone can oppose this." 
And on back-to-back roll calls, 206-199 and 223-178, the <ORGANIZATION>Appropriations Committee</ORGANIZATION> leadership turned back efforts to weaken or strip the proposed restrictions first added by <PERSON>Sen. Warren Rudman</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>N.H.</LOCATION>) 
The estimated $40 million from the new pre-merger notification fee would be divided between the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>'s Antitrust Division and the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Trade Commission</ORGANIZATION>, which both face serious cuts if the income isn't realized.
The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> agreed to defer for a year a scheduled 50% increase in the required state matching funds for law-enforcement grants but, by a 287-123 margin, the chamber stripped a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> initiative to raise the minimum grant for smaller states, such as <ORGANIZATION>New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, to $1.6 million from $500,000. 
When a <ORGANIZATION>House-Senate</ORGANIZATION> conference on yesterday's bill rescinded $11.8 million in unexpended funds for a <LOCATION>Fort Worth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, economic development project backed by former Speaker <PERSON>James Wright</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sen. Phil Gramm</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>) insisted last week that the money be preserved. 
The measure includes $2 million secured by <PERSON>Mr. Rudman</PERSON> for a marine-research project at the <ORGANIZATION>University of New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Sen. Ernest Hollings</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>) used his power to add $10 million for an advanced technology initiative in the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION>.
This was in addition to a more parochial $4.5 million authorization for a health center in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> upheld by a 273-121 vote in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> last night. 
Pilots of <ORGANIZATION>Federal Express Corp.</ORGANIZATION> voted to reject affiliation with the <ORGANIZATION>Air Line Pilots Association</ORGANIZATION>, giving a resounding victory to the company's founder and chairman, <PERSON>Frederick W. Smith</PERSON>. 
In the <ORGANIZATION>National Mediation Board</ORGANIZATION> election, 709 pilots voted to support the union, out of a total electorate of 2,022 <ORGANIZATION>Federal Express</ORGANIZATION> aviators.
The results were unexpectedly dismal for the pro-union side, especially given that some 960 eligible voters were former <ORGANIZATION>Tiger International Inc.</ORGANIZATION> pilots who had been longtime <ORGANIZATION>ALPA</ORGANIZATION> members.
A pilots' union would have been <ORGANIZATION>Federal Express</ORGANIZATION>'s first major collective bargaining unit in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, and company executives had feared that it would soften <ORGANIZATION>Federal</ORGANIZATION>'s gung-ho, customer-driven culture. 
"The company feels very gratified" with the vote, said <PERSON>T. Allan McArtor</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Federal</ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president, air operations. "We like to think that the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Express</ORGANIZATION> management can deal directly with its pilots without a union's intervention." <PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON>, through a spokesman, declined to be interviewed yesterday. 
In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>ALPA</ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying the union was "disappointed" with the election's outcome.
As for the veteran Federal pilots, <PERSON>Mr. Barnhardt</PERSON> said the pro-union side had counted on getting at least 100 of them to support <ORGANIZATION>ALPA</ORGANIZATION>.
Depending on how a mediator reconciles the different job classifications of <ORGANIZATION>Federal and Tiger</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Federal Express</ORGANIZATION> still faces possible union elections this fall among airplane mechanics, ramp workers and stock clerks. 
In composite trading yesterday on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Federal</ORGANIZATION>'s shares closed at $52, down 12.5 cents. 
But some economists suggest the politicians' new infatuation with IRAs may be misplaced at a time when <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and the president aren't taking the more important step of shrinking the federal budget deficit. "If increasing savings is the object," says economist <PERSON>Jane Gravelle</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Congressional Research Service</ORGANIZATION>, "a reduction in the deficit would be a more certain and more powerful way of achieving such an end." (The nation's total savings is what's left after substracting government borrowing from household and corporate savings.) 
The shortcoming of offering immediate rewards for putting money in an <ORGANIZATION>IRA</ORGANIZATION>, as the Democrats propose, is that it will widen the budget deficit by an estimated $12.5 billion over the next five years. "The big problem is the up-front cost," says <PERSON>Sen. William Roth</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Del.</LOCATION>), chief Republican cheerleader for IRAs. 
The shortcomings of delaying the reward, as <PERSON>Sen. Roth</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sen. Robert Packwood</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>) propose, is that it may not boost savings much and, if it does, it may widen deficits in the future. "It looks like you haven't given anything away, but five, 10, 20, 40 years later, little bomblets go off," says <PERSON>Henry Aaron</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Brookings Institution</ORGANIZATION> economist. 
Although <ORGANIZATION>IRA</ORGANIZATION> fans in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> have been talking about restoring incentives that were curtailed in 1986, they gained momentum only after <ORGANIZATION>Senate Finance Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>) seized on IRAs as an alternative to cutting capital-gains taxes. 
Republican senators, unwilling to concede the popular <ORGANIZATION>IRA</ORGANIZATION> issue to Democrats, suddenly embraced a scheme <PERSON>Sen. Roth</PERSON> had been pressing with little success.
The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration, which was planning to unveil an <ORGANIZATION>IRA</ORGANIZATION> proposal of its own next year, was quick to do the same.
Economist <PERSON>David Wise</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Harvard University</ORGANIZATION> figures 70% was actually new savings; many prominent economists -- including <PERSON>Michael Boskin</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Council of Economic Advisers</ORGANIZATION> -- agree that IRAs did result in significant new savings. 
And <PERSON>Robert McIntyre</PERSON>, director of the labor-backed Citizens for <ORGANIZATION>Tax Justice</ORGANIZATION> and an admirer of the 1986 Tax Reform Act that limited IRAs, goes further. "They don't work," he contends. "They just give people a tax break for savings they would have done anyway." 
Balances in <ORGANIZATION>IRA</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Keogh</LOCATION> accounts (retirement accounts for the self-employed), which had swelled by $75 billion in 1986, grew by only $48 billion in 1988, including interest on past contributions. 
Some economists predict any <ORGANIZATION>IRA</ORGANIZATION> plan will boost savings because brokerage houses, mutual funds and banks will advertise them heavily. "It may well be that saving, like life insurance, is sold, not bought," says Lawrence Summers of <ORGANIZATION>Harvard University</ORGANIZATION>.
He notes that as <ORGANIZATION>IRA</ORGANIZATION> ads vanished, even many middle-income Americans still eligible for the full <ORGANIZATION>IRA</ORGANIZATION> tax break stopped contributing. 
Under the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic</ORGANIZATION> plan, a 40-year-old in the 33% tax bracket who saves $2,000 in an <ORGANIZATION>IRA</ORGANIZATION> would cut his tax bill by $175 immediately.
Nonetheless, some economists argue that Americans simply won't save unless the government gives them an immediate reward. "This instant gratification overcomes the usual bias against savings," says <PERSON>John Skinner</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> economist.
The clincher, he says, is that people who owed money to the <ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION> were far more likely to put money in an <ORGANIZATION>IRA</ORGANIZATION> than those who were due a refund. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Employee Benefit Research Institute</ORGANIZATION> says about 23% of all workers earning more than $50,000 a year made <ORGANIZATION>IRA</ORGANIZATION> deposits in 1987, down from 56% in 1982 but still nearly one million people. 
<PERSON>Donald Underwood</PERSON>, head of retirement planning for <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, says he was surprised to discover that more money flowed into the firm's <ORGANIZATION>IRA</ORGANIZATION> accounts in 1988 than in 1987. (A big <ORGANIZATION>IRA</ORGANIZATION> fan, <PERSON>Mr. Underwood</PERSON>'s license plate reads: 
<ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION> is convinced the <ORGANIZATION>Republican IRA</ORGANIZATION> plan would appeal to its customers, and it is lobbying strongly for it. "I think people are really concerned about what the tax rate will be in the future," <PERSON>Mr. Underwood</PERSON> says.
But allowing the interest buildup on those contributions to escape taxation would cost the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> far more than that sum in the long run, the <ORGANIZATION>Congressional Budget Office</ORGANIZATION> says. "It's a huge giveaway," <PERSON>Mr. Summers</PERSON> protests. 
Second, <PERSON>Sen. Roth</PERSON> insists that the extra savings his plan would produce would spur so much extra economic growth that the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> wouldn't suffer.
Stocks rose in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> for the first time since Monday, and ended mixed in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>. 
In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>ICI</ORGANIZATION>, which is part of the <ORGANIZATION>Financial Times</ORGANIZATION> 100-share index, said its pretax profit for the quarter dropped 12%, significantly worse than market expectations.
"<ORGANIZATION>ICI</ORGANIZATION> is a bellwether of <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> corporate profitability," a senior dealer with <ORGANIZATION>Warburg Securities</ORGANIZATION> said. "Its results were disappointing.
Dealers and analysts also said that <ORGANIZATION>ICI</ORGANIZATION>'s troubles in specialty paints helped underscore growing worries over the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economy.
<ORGANIZATION>ICI</ORGANIZATION>'s paint operations are heavily involved in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
In other shares, <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> textile group <ORGANIZATION>Tootal</ORGANIZATION> rose 7 to 120 pence on conditional clearance from regulators for <ORGANIZATION>Coats Viyella</ORGANIZATION>'s bid for <ORGANIZATION>Tootal</ORGANIZATION>, so long as <ORGANIZATION>Coats</ORGANIZATION> spins off its <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> sewing thread business.

<LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> prices ended mixed in thin trading after an early rally led by <ORGANIZATION>Deutsche Bank</ORGANIZATION> fizzled during the session.
<ORGANIZATION>Deutsche Bank</ORGANIZATION> surged at the opening on news that the bank has 10% holdings in several large companies, including insurer <ORGANIZATION>Allianz</ORGANIZATION> and reinsurer <ORGANIZATION>Munich Re</ORGANIZATION>.
The disclosure late Wednesday came as <ORGANIZATION>Deutsche Bank</ORGANIZATION> announced the issue of 1.2 million new shares for placement in the <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> market. 
Among other banks, <ORGANIZATION>Dresdner Bank</ORGANIZATION> gained 1.5 to 321.5 after receiving official authorization to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Banque Internationale</ORGANIZATION> de Placement in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, but <ORGANIZATION>Commerzbank</ORGANIZATION> slipped 0.5 to 246.

The research, recently presented at a scientific conference in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, was conducted by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Public Health Service Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Staten Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>
"The cancer mortality `excess, ' particularly respiratory cancer, is not specific to the <LOCATION>Staten Island</LOCATION> facility, but is characteristic of the <ORGANIZATION>Public Health Service Hospital System</ORGANIZATION> as a whole," the report concluded.
The research group was headed by <PERSON>Dr. Howard R. Kelman</PERSON>, chief of health services research at the <LOCATION>Staten Island</LOCATION> hospital. 
Lawyers for former <ORGANIZATION>Housing and Urban Development</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Samuel Pierce</PERSON> say he again will refuse to answer questions from a congressional subcommittee investigating federal housing scandals. 
In a letter to Rep. <PERSON>Tom Lantos</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>), chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Government Operations subcommittee on housing and employment, the lawyers said <PERSON>Mr. Pierce</PERSON> would invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination at hearings scheduled for today and Friday. 
The letter sent yesterday to <PERSON>Mr. Lantos</PERSON> says <PERSON>Mr. Pierce</PERSON> "is concerned that there continues to be an atmosphere wherein he remains a target of the subcommittee's hearings." 
In the letter, lawyers <PERSON>Paul Perito</PERSON>, <PERSON>Robert Plotkin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Inez Smith</PERSON> say they "hope that sometime in the near future the present level of tension may be reduced such that <PERSON>Mr. Pierce</PERSON> can reconsider his present position and testify under fair and mutually agreeable circumstances." 
"This was a bit surprising," said <PERSON>John Lonski</PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
The junk bonds of <ORGANIZATION>RJR Nabisco</ORGANIZATION>, which have been whipsawed in recent months for a variety of reasons, fell sharply yesterday on rumors of possible problems with <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION>'s pending $1.48 billion sale of its <ORGANIZATION>Del Monte</ORGANIZATION> canned foods unit to a group led by <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co</ORGANIZATION>. However, late yesterday, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION> said the planned sale is on track. 
Proceeds from the <ORGANIZATION>Del Monte</ORGANIZATION> sale would account for a portion of the $5 billion worth of bank debt <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION> had planned to repay by Feb. 9.
Late yesterday, a <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> official said the department may take the unprecedented step of borrowing $17 billion to avoid default on certain obligations unless <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> assures by 1 p.m. EDT today that it will raise the debt limit, according to Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. 
If assurance isn't given, the official said the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> might raise the money by adding to the weekly <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bill issue or through a cash-management bill issue. 
The official said <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Nicholas Brady</PERSON> indicated the possible move in a letter dated yesterday to <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON>Robert Michel</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>). 
<ORGANIZATION>Ginnie Mae</ORGANIZATION> 9% securities were at 98 5/8 late yesterday, up 2/32, and <ORGANIZATION>Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 9% securities were at 97 3/4, up 1/32.
The yield spread of the <ORGANIZATION>Ginnie Mae</ORGANIZATION> 9% issue over the 10-year <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> note narrowed 0.01 percentage point to 1.45. 
In derivative markets, the <ORGANIZATION>Federal National Mortgage Association</ORGANIZATION> issued a $500 million real estate mortgage investment conduit backed by its 9% securities through <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
In other matters, <ORGANIZATION>Maryland National Bank</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of Baltimore-based <ORGANIZATION>MNC Financial Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, became the first commercial bank to issue securities backed by home-equity lines of credit.
"The outlook for the industry is grim," said <PERSON>Howard Foster</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>E.F. Hutton</ORGANIZATION> analyst, in January 1974.
A bankruptcy court in <LOCATION>Orlando</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, where the case is being heard, approved <PERSON>Braniff</PERSON>'s request to retain <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION>. 
Cie. de Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Marc Fournier</PERSON> said his board unanimously rejected as too low the $1.77 billion bid by <ORGANIZATION>Cie.
At a news conference, <PERSON>Mr. Fournier</PERSON> accused <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> of planning to pay for the takeover by selling parts of the company, whose interests include insurance, banking, tuna canning, sugar and orange juice. 
The chairman said his board members, including representatives of West German insurance giant <ORGANIZATION>Allianz AG</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> banks <ORGANIZATION>Credit Lyonnais</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Societe Generale</ORGANIZATION>, hold nearly 50% of <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION>'s capital. 
<PERSON>Mr. Fournier</PERSON> said that as <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> chairman, he is prohibited by takeover regulations from organizing his own defense or doing anything besides managing current company business.
But sources said he will be urging his allies to boost their stakes in <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION>, which is being traded in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and is to resume trading in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> Tuesday.
<PERSON>Mr. Fournier</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION>'s 1989 unconsolidated, or parent-company, profit is likely to be 4.7 billion francs ($754.4 million), up from 633.8 million francs last year.
That is due mostly to payments from <LOCATION>Allianz</LOCATION> for most of the 50% stake it has agreed to acquire in <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION>'s insurance business.
<ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> still needs the go-ahead from the <ORGANIZATION>Commission des Operations de Bourse</ORGANIZATION>, a government regulatory agency, but analysts said that is considered likely. 
<PERSON>Mr. Fournier</PERSON> also noted that <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> joined <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION>'s core of shareholders when <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> was denationalized in 1987, and said it now holds just under 5% of <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION>'s shares.
Once he realized that <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION>'s intentions weren't friendly, he said, but before the bid was launched, he sought approval to boost his <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> stake above 10%.
The petition is still pending, but <PERSON>Mr. Fournier</PERSON> downplayed the likelihood of his organizing a takeover bid of his own for the much-larger <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Fournier</PERSON> said the large institutions that hold nearly 50% of <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION>'s capital all strongly support him, but some analysts said they aren't so sure.
<ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> is <PERSON>Allianz</PERSON>'s lead French bank. 
<ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> said Monday that it intends to bid to boost its stake in <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> to 66.7%, from the 18.7% it already owns.
<ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> says it will offer 1,850 francs ($296.95) each for <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> shares that enjoy full dividend rights, and 1,800 francs each for a block of shares issued July 1, which will receive only partial dividends this year.
Alternatively, it is to offer three <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> shares for one <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> share.
The <ORGANIZATION>Paribas</ORGANIZATION> offer values <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION> at about 23 billion francs, depending on how many of <ORGANIZATION>Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION>'s warrants are converted into shares during the takeover battle. 
<ORGANIZATION>McDonald's Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, under pressure by environmental groups to stop using polystyrene containers, announced a program here to foster recycling of the plastics at 450 of its <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> restaurants. 
The plastic will be sent to a plant in <LOCATION>Leominster</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, near <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, which is owned by a joint venture recently formed by plastics makers.
The program will reduce trash, help educate youngsters about recycling and "is a big step toward a better environment," asserted <PERSON>Shelby Yastrow</PERSON>, <PERSON>McDonald</PERSON>'s senior vice president, environmental affairs. 
The plant in <LOCATION>Leominster</LOCATION> is the first of five planned by the <ORGANIZATION>National Polystyrene Recycling Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the plastics-industry joint venture.
It was formed earlier this year by <ORGANIZATION>Dow Chemical Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Mobil Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and six other concerns in response to concerns about growing amounts of non-biodegradable plastic trash.
<PERSON>Paul Keough</PERSON> , acting regional director for the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, said, "We hope that other large companies follow McDonald's lead to undertake similar programs." But <PERSON>Amy Perry</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> offshoot of <ORGANIZATION>Ralph Nader</ORGANIZATION>'s lobbying outfits, argued that the program "just serves to legitimize increasing the use of throwaway plastics.
Among other things, the groups have urged consumers to mail used McDonald's plastic containers to its <LOCATION>Oak Brook</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, headquarters. 
Concerns about plastic trash also have sparked legislative initiatives, such as one in <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, to ban polystyrene products as of January.
"Political pressure has been a factor" in the introduction of recycling programs by plastics makers and sellers, conceded <PERSON>Ken Harman</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>National Polystyrene</ORGANIZATION>'s acting president and chairman, at the news conference, which was held in a <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's</ORGANIZATION> restaurant next to <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>'s Children's Museum. 
Some of the pressure became evident during the news conference when a McDonald's customer startled company officials by blurting out, "Why do you produce so much trash in the first place?" The customer, <PERSON>Jeff Simpson</PERSON>, a visitor from <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, later explained that he was vexed by all the plastic, paper and cardboard that came with the McDonald's breakfast he had just eaten.
<ORGANIZATION>The World Bank</ORGANIZATION> approved $363 million in loans to the <LOCATION>Ivory Coast</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> will get two loans amounting to $147 million for schools, roads and other projects in urban areas and to help finance agricultural research projects in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> and northeastern regions of the country. 
One especially dangerous aspect to the new tax would be that the proceeds will be used to increase the budgets of the antitrust division at <ORGANIZATION>Justice</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Trade Commission</ORGANIZATION>.
Also, as former <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> antitrust chief <PERSON>Charles Rule</PERSON> has noted, this would "establish the precedent that the government may charge parties for the privilege of being sued regardless of whether the government prevails." 
Because of the heavy selling of such large stocks as <ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Oracle Systems</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Apple Computer</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Lotus Development</ORGANIZATION>, the Nasdaq Composite Index slumped 4.74, or 1%, to 458.15.
By comparison, the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange Composite</ORGANIZATION> fell 1%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 1.5% and the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 Index dropped 1%. 
The Utility Index, which includes Tele-Communications, <ORGANIZATION>MCI Communications</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>LIN Broadcasting</ORGANIZATION>, plummeted 9.55 to 734.41.
I didn't see any buying at all," said <PERSON>William Sulya</PERSON>, head <ORGANIZATION>OTC</ORGANIZATION> trader at <ORGANIZATION>A.G. Edwards & Sons</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Tony Cecin</PERSON>, managing director of equity trading at <ORGANIZATION>Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, said the overall OTC market is drifting lower in part because "nobody has the nerve to make a bid for anything," he said.
<ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION>'s quarterly earnings were at the low end of analysts' forecasts, and the company said it is experiencing problems with a new microchip from <ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION> confirmed the <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION> report, but said the problems aren't expected to affect most users, except in "certain scientific applications." <ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION> said it has more than 200 customers using the chip. 
<ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> tumbled 2 to 77 3/4 and <ORGANIZATION>Lotus Development</ORGANIZATION> was off 1 5/8 to 30 5/8. 
In response to a similar lawsuit by <ORGANIZATION>MCI</ORGANIZATION> filed earlier, <ORGANIZATION>American Telephone & Telegraph</ORGANIZATION> sued its competitor for misleading advertising. 
Yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said it won't enter an unlimited bidding war with <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s shares. 
The paving-equipment maker said the loss was caused by bad weather, which had hurt sales in its <ORGANIZATION>Barber-Greene Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Telsmith Inc.</ORGANIZATION> units. 
<ORGANIZATION>Foremost Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> surged 2 1/8 to 36 1/2.
CONFRONTATIONS LOOM between <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and Democrats in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. 
They begin to blame <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s insistence on a capital-gains cut for the disarray in the budget process; one <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> aide sees a "train wreck" coming.
The Democrats also increasingly lash <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> for timidity on <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> still tries a personal touch; he golfs with <ORGANIZATION>Ways and Means</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Rostenkowski</PERSON> and meets privately with <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Democrats. 
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> intelligence chiefs <PERSON>Boren</PERSON> and <PERSON>Cohen</PERSON> agree with the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> to loosen the rules; <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> agents stand to gain broad leeway to work with rebels, even if a coup might endanger <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s life. 
One possibility is more active <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> recruitment of rebels who would agree to hand <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and install the elected leaders he rebuffed.
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> has purged potential enemies, and doubts grow about <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> resolve.

Illinois Attorney General <PERSON>Neil Hartigan</PERSON>, whose gubernatorial campaign is under pressure from pro-choice forces, pursues a settlement of the current <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> case challenging the state's tough restrictions on abortion clinics.
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>'s new abortion law almost certainly will provide a <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> test, but probably not until next year.
Abortion-rights activists plan a new series of major marches next month, but their biggest boost would come with a gubernatorial victory in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, where black nominee <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON> is riding the pro-choice issue hard. 
The <ORGANIZATION>National Abortion Rights Action League</ORGANIZATION>, already running ads for <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON>, hits the airwaves today for <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey Democratic</ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON>Florio</PERSON>. 
MINOR MEMOS: Among documents in the <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> scandal: a handwritten 1987 letter from presidential son <PERSON>Jeb Bush</PERSON> to <PERSON>Deborah Dean</PERSON>, a central figure in the scandal, wishing her "every success in trying to clean up the federal government's act." . . . GOP Rep. <PERSON>Bentley</PERSON> writes business PACs promising to "lead the battle" against President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s proposal to abolish them -- and asking for money for her 1990 campaign. . . . <PERSON>Sen. Mitchell</PERSON>'s advice to visiting Supreme Soviet members drawing up rules for their legislature: "Don't copy ours." 
<ORGANIZATION>Bolar Pharmaceutical Co.</ORGANIZATION>, under pressure from the <ORGANIZATION>Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION>, agreed to recall its generic version of the antibiotic drug <PERSON>Macrodantin</PERSON> from retail shelves, according to <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> officials. 
Earlier this month, <PERSON>Bolar</PERSON> began recalling its nitrofurantoin macrocrystalline capsules from wholesalers and distributors because of <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> evidence suggesting that the company passed off <ORGANIZATION>Macrodantin</ORGANIZATION> as its own to obtain <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> approval to market its generic product.
But on Oct. 25, the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> offered additional evidence to buttress its case that the brand-name drug had been substituted for <ORGANIZATION>Bolar</ORGANIZATION>'s product in pre-market testing, <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> officials said yesterday.
The agency now has evidence that <ORGANIZATION>Bolar</ORGANIZATION> submitted <PERSON>Macrodantin</PERSON> as its generic version for testing not only at <ORGANIZATION>PharmaKinetics Laboratories Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>, but also at an independent laboratory in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> investigators obtained a sample of the Bolar drug from the Canadian lab, according to <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON>Michael Shaffer</PERSON>. "It turned out to be the brand-name product," he said. 
In <LOCATION>Copiague</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Robert Shulman</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Bolar</ORGANIZATION>, and sales director <PERSON>Karen Sattig</PERSON> couldn't be reached for comment. 
The inspector general's office of the <ORGANIZATION>Health and Human Services Department</ORGANIZATION> already is conducting a criminal investigation of whether Bolar filed "false information" with the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> in seeking clearance to market at least two generic drugs. 
Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> is moving to withdraw its approval of <ORGANIZATION>Bolar</ORGANIZATION>'s nitrofurantoin macrocrystalline capsules, which are used primarily to treat urinary-tract infections.
The brand-name drug is manufactured by <PERSON>Norwich Eaton</PERSON>, a subsidiary of Cincinnati-based <ORGANIZATION>Procter & Gamble Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
Although no health problems are known to have been caused by <PERSON>Bolar</PERSON>'s product, the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> officials said the agency can no longer ensure that it is the equivalent of <PERSON>Macrodantin</PERSON>. 
In <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Bolar</ORGANIZATION> closed at $14.375, down 50 cents. 
Although Quantum has captured about a 20% share of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> polyethylene market, it is more vulnerable to price swings than some of its bigger rivals, including <ORGANIZATION>Dow Chemical Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Union Carbide Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which have much broader business bases. 
In addition, two devastating fires at Quantum's chemical complex in <LOCATION>Morris</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, caused an estimated loss of $22 million, or 89 cents a share, in the third quarter.
<ORGANIZATION>The University of Toronto</ORGANIZATION> said it will drop its objections to the offer by <ORGANIZATION>Institut Merieux S.A.</ORGANIZATION> to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Connaught BioSciences Inc.</ORGANIZATION> for 942 million Canadian dollars (US$803.7 million) after reaching a research agreement with the French vaccine manufacturer. 
Under the terms of the accord, similar to an agreement reached last week between the university and <ORGANIZATION>Merieux</ORGANIZATION>'s rival bidders for Connaught, <ORGANIZATION>Ciba-Geigy Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Chiron Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Merieux</ORGANIZATION> agreed to spend 15 million Canadian dollars (US$12.8 million) to fund vaccine-related research in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, C$9 million of which would go to the university's research programs. 
The university had sued <ORGANIZATION>Connaught</ORGANIZATION>, arguing its directors had broken a 1972 agreement not to sell the company to a foreign concern by recommending <ORGANIZATION>Merieux</ORGANIZATION>'s offer to shareholders.
A decision in the university's favor could block <ORGANIZATION>Connaught</ORGANIZATION>'s directors from recommending <ORGANIZATION>Merieux</ORGANIZATION>'s offer to shareholders, but couldn't block the company's sale. 
"Both of these agreements are good, both add substantial benefits to <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>," he said. "Ciba-Geigy {and Chiron} are offering slightly more investment dollars �to Canadian universities� and some new products, but <ORGANIZATION>Merieux</ORGANIZATION> is proposing to build a new biotechnology center." 
Ciba-Geigy, a <LOCATION>Swiss</LOCATION> pharmaceutical company, and California-based <ORGANIZATION>Chiron</ORGANIZATION>, a pharmaceutical research concern, are offering C$866 million, or C$30 a share, for Connaught. 
The Canadian government said earlier this month that the proposed <ORGANIZATION>Merieux</ORGANIZATION> acquisition didn't appear to offer enough "net benefit" to <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> to approve. 
"Reaching an agreement is an advantage to both the university and <ORGANIZATION>Merieux</ORGANIZATION>, both in terms of business and politically, since the university has been quite vocal about the issue of foreign ownership," said <PERSON>Philippe Stoeckel</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Merieux Institute Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Merieux</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> subsidiary. 
When <ORGANIZATION>Adolph Coors Co.</ORGANIZATION> announced the appointment of <PERSON>William Coors</PERSON> as president late Wednesday, <PERSON>Peter Coors</PERSON> wasn't promoted -- at least not officially. 
But the announcement by the big <LOCATION>Golden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, brewer was an implicit statement of <PERSON>Peter Coor</PERSON>'s rising role at the company, analysts say.
It also underscores the difficult task ahead as <ORGANIZATION>Coors</ORGANIZATION> attempts to purchase <ORGANIZATION>Stroh Brewery Co.</ORGANIZATION> and fight off increasingly tough competition from <LOCATION>Anheuser-Busch Cos</LOCATION>. 
The latest management shuffling at <ORGANIZATION>Coors</ORGANIZATION> seemed to focus on <PERSON>Jeffrey Coors</PERSON>, who will relinquish the president's post to his uncle <PERSON>William</PERSON>, who is 73.
<PERSON>Jeffrey</PERSON>, who at 44 is one year older than his brother <PERSON>Peter</PERSON>, will head up <ORGANIZATION>Coors Technology Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a small unit he has run for several years. 
Indeed, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Coors</ORGANIZATION> said that since January, <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> has been reporting directly to <PERSON>William</PERSON>, rather than to his brother.
The change in titles "makes the structure conform to the reality," the spokesman said. (<PERSON>William</PERSON>, the brothers, another brother <PERSON>Joe Jr.</PERSON>, and their father <PERSON>Joseph Sr.</PERSON> all serve on the company's nine-member board.) 
According to analysts, the changes reflect the tough task the company faces in integrating the operations and marketing efforts of <LOCATION>Stroh</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Coors</ORGANIZATION>, steering the merger through the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> and continuing to fight the battle <ORGANIZATION>Coors</ORGANIZATION> is waging with <PERSON>Anheuser</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Miller Brewing Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris Cos</ORGANIZATION>. 
"It's gray-beard time," said <PERSON>Tom Pirko</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Bevmark Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> consulting firm, referring to the move of <LOCATION>William</LOCATION> into the presidency. "This is a time of tremendous risk at the company, and <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> has a tremendous amount of responsibility." Putting <PERSON>William</PERSON> at the helm probably won't increase the elder <ORGANIZATION>Coors</ORGANIZATION>'s imput into the beer business, but "it doesn't hurt to have a senior statesman at the top," he said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Coors</ORGANIZATION> stressed that the removal of <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> from the presidency wasn't a demotion, but would allow him to devote his full attention to his unit.
But overall, "Coors's success or lack thereof depends on the beer business," said <PERSON>Emanuel Goldman</PERSON>, analyst at <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Goldman</PERSON> credits <ORGANIZATION>Peter Coors</ORGANIZATION> with "pulling <ORGANIZATION>Coors</ORGANIZATION>'s marketing efforts into the 20th century" by pushing for intensified marketing efforts, modern advertising campaigns and significantly higher marketing expenditures.
Analysts also credit <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> with selling other family members on the purchase of <LOCATION>Stroh</LOCATION>, a transaction that will cost about $425 million and slap a big piece of debt on <ORGANIZATION>Coors</ORGANIZATION>'s books for the first time in the company's history. 
"<PERSON>Peter</PERSON> had a major struggle in getting this done," said <PERSON>Mr. Pirko</PERSON>.
Taking on debt was controversial within the family, <PERSON>Mr. Pirko</PERSON> added, but in the end, "<PERSON>Peter</PERSON> called the shots." 
And <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> will continue to be under the gun, given the dominance of <PERSON>Anheuser</PERSON>, the stubbornly flat beer market of the past decade and recent <ORGANIZATION>Coors</ORGANIZATION> financial results that have been frustratingly mediocre.
<PERSON>Peter Coors</PERSON>, however, said the discounting by <PERSON>Anheuser</PERSON> could also mean that <ORGANIZATION>Coors</ORGANIZATION>' increased marketing efforts are having an impact.
A <ORGANIZATION>Fujitsu</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the weaker performance reflected slipping sales to <ORGANIZATION>Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s domestic telephone monopoly. 
The strongest sign of the Big Three's woes came from <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which said it had a loss in its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> automotive business for the first time since 1982.
Still, the combined profit of <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> fell 44% to $1.02 billion from $1.83 billion a year earlier, excluding a one-time gain of $309 million at <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> from the sale of <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> stock.
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s common closed at $44.375 a share, down 50 cents, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> fell 37.5 cents to end at $47.50, and <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> eased 37.5 cents to $22.25, all in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading. 
As Japanese auto makers gained market share, the <ORGANIZATION>Big Three</ORGANIZATION>, with <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> in the lead, slashed North American production and launched a retail discounting blitz.
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> probably had the "heaviest incentives," said <PERSON>Robert S. Miller</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer. "We all did what we had to do to stay within sight of them." 
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> have already cut fourth-quarter <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> output plans an estimated 15% from 1988 levels.
Nearly all the decline came in <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> automotive operations.
The <LOCATION>Dearborn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, auto maker ran a loss of $37 million on assembling and marketing cars in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, a deterioration of $378 million in that line from the 1988 quarter. 
But <PERSON>David N. McCammon</PERSON>, vice president, finance, insisted that cost-cutting and tight production capacity will make results "better in this downturn than in prior downturns," when <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> had net losses. 
Still, <PERSON>Mr. McCammon</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> expects the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economy to weaken through the end of 1990, causing weaker sales and production.
<PERSON>Mr. Miller</PERSON> said costs of incentives caused a "moderate" loss in the <LOCATION>Highland Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, company's <ORGANIZATION>North American</ORGANIZATION> car and truck business.
He said the loss wasn't "that much different" from <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s $37 million loss on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> automotive operations, but he declined to be specific. 
<PERSON>Mr. Miller</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> spent an average of $1,000 a vehicle on its incentive programs in the third quarter, compared with about $450 a vehicle a year earlier -- a "high-water mark" at the time. 
Detroit-based <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> doesn't issue separate quarterly earnings for the <LOCATION>North American</LOCATION> automotive business.
In one breakdown, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> attributed half of its net to its two big technology units, <ORGANIZATION>Electronic Data Systems Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>GM Hughes Electronics Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> said overseas auto operations are on track to exceed last year's record full-year net of $2.7 billion. 
<ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas Corp.</ORGANIZATION> reported a 54% drop in third-quarter net income, but its <ORGANIZATION>Douglas Aircraft Co.</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary appears to be fixing some of its problems. 
"They lost $28 million, but that is good news," said <PERSON>Jack Modzelewski</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION> analyst, who had expected <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON>'s loss to be as much as $50 million.
Indeed, while investors weren't exactly gleeful, <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas</ORGANIZATION> held steady on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, closing yesterday at $67.125 a share, unchanged. 
Besides the troubles at <ORGANIZATION>Douglas</ORGANIZATION> -- which continued to be plagued by high development costs on the new MD-11 tri-jet and parts shortages -- <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas</ORGANIZATION>'s combat aircraft segment also had its difficulties.
<PERSON>Mr. Modzelewski</PERSON>, while noting that times are tough for arms makers, said he expected <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas</ORGANIZATION>'s Pentagon-related projects to "bounce back next quarter" to some degree.
A number of defense-oriented aerospace companies, including <ORGANIZATION>Northrop Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>General Dynamics Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, have reported either flat or lower third-quarter earnings. 
Company officials boast that <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON> could account for half of <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas</ORGANIZATION> revenues by 1992, compared with about a third now.
Besides the MD-80 and MD-11 commercial jetliners, <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON> is building the T-45 <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> trainer and C-17 military transport. 
But whether things at the <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, subsidiary can really be turned around has yet to be seen. "<PERSON>Douglas</PERSON> is improving," said <PERSON>Judith Comeau</PERSON>, analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, "but they're no where near where they need to be." 
However, the talks didn't produce any changes in the $576 million <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> offer, which a committee of <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION>'s two independent directors has rejected as inadequate. 
<PERSON>Peter Skinner</PERSON>, vice president and corporate general counsel for <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION>, said yesterday's talks took place both on the telephone and in person. "We discussed the bid, but <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> and its board of directors believe the bid is full and fair," <PERSON>Mr. Skinner</PERSON> said.
He said no future talks are currently scheduled, but added that <PERSON>Dow Jones</PERSON> representatives will meet again with <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> officials if <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> seeks a meeting. 
<ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> disclosed the opening of negotiations in a filing with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>, which said that "there can be no assurance that such negotiations will continue or will result in revised terms that will be satisfactory to the special committee." 
The talks followed an effort by <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> to place a strongly worded advertisement attacking the <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> offer in yesterday's editions of The Wall Street Journal, according to two people familiar with <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION>. 
After <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> submitted its ad to the Journal Wednesday, the people said, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> telephoned a <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> lawyer.
Soon thereafter, <PERSON>Warren H. Phillips</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION>, telephoned <PERSON>Neil S. Hirsch</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION>.
As a result of the conversations, the people said, <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> decided not to run the ad yesterday, and <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> agreed to meet with <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Skinner</PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> executives had been told that the ad would be submitted by <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> and were advised of its content.
The <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> executives indicated to <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> executives that such an ad would not be "helpful," <PERSON>Mr. Skinner</PERSON> said, and <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> decided not to run the ad. 
A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> declined to elaborate on <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION>'s filing with the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> stock rose 87.5 cents to close at $20.50 in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday.
Many of Wall Street's takeover-stock speculators bought relatively large positions in <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> stock after <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> announced its tender offer on Sept. 21.
The traders are betting <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> will increase its $18-a-share offer in order to acquire full ownership of <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION>, an electronic distributor of financial-market information. 
But the takeover stock traders, who declined to be identified, said they believe it is unrealistic to expect <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> will pay that much, considering it already owns about 67% of <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Bruce Thorp</PERSON>, an analyst at Philadelphia-based <ORGANIZATION>Provident National Bank</ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION>'s tender offer reflects a typical premium for the purchase of a remaining minority stake.
He thinks <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> will end up paying $20 or $21 a share for <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on <PERSON>Mr. Thorp</PERSON>'s speculation. 
<ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION>'s proposed ad, headlined "What Now, Dow Jones?" was in the form of a letter to <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> directors. "How can a company of <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION>'s reputation persist in a coercive attempt to squeeze out the minority shareholders of <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> at a low-ball price of $18 a share?" the ad asked.
"We are forced to consider <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION>'s actions as hostile -- to <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION>'s shareholders, management, and employees," the ad said.
It was signed by <PERSON>Mr. Hirsch</PERSON>, three other <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> directors who are employees of <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION>, and two outside directors. 
People familiar with <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> said the ad was intended to encourage Dow Jones to begin negotiations and was submitted to the Journal for that reason. "We could have run it in the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION>," one person familiar with <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> said. 
As evidence of their contention that the current <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> offer is too low, takeover-stock speculators pointed to an <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> filing by <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> disclosing that Dow Jones managers had proposed offering $19 a share for <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION>.
After the <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> special committee rejected the <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> offer as inadequate, <PERSON>Mr. Phillips</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> said, "We are proceeding with our $18-a-share offer and continue to believe that the offer is fair to all <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> stockholders." The offer is scheduled to expire Nov. 3. 
Separately, a hearing is scheduled for Monday in <ORGANIZATION>Delaware Chancery Court</ORGANIZATION> on a motion by certain <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> shareholders seeking a court order to block the <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> tender offer. 
However, <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> paid $28.75 a share for one block of about 10.5 million <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> shares in September 1987.
<ORGANIZATION>New Hampshire Yankee Co.</ORGANIZATION>, operator of the <LOCATION>Seabrook</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.H.</LOCATION>, nuclear power facility, said the <ORGANIZATION>Nuclear Regulatory Commission</ORGANIZATION> fined it $50,000 in connection with improper procedures in shutting down the plant during low-power testing last June. 
<PERSON>Edward A. Brown</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>New Hampshire Yankee</ORGANIZATION>, said it accepts the decision and will pay the fine.
New <ORGANIZATION>Hampshire Yankee</ORGANIZATION> is 35.6%-owned by <ORGANIZATION>Public Service Co. of New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION>. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <PERSON>Brunswick</PERSON> closed at $14.50, down 37.5 cents. 
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> negotiators approved a $3.18 billion anti-drug and anti-crime initiative, cutting domestic and defense spending 0.43% to pay for it. 
It is part of a compromise $26 billion fiscal 1990 spending bill for the <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION> and highway and airport trust funds that the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> is expected to ratify Tuesday. 
The specific offsetting spending cuts are to be determined by the 13 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and 13 <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> appropriations subcommittees.
In some cases, those decisions have already been made and the results reflected in spending bills approved by the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. 
The dollar rose modestly against the mark and the yen, but soared against the pound following the resignation of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s chancellor of the Exchequer, <PERSON>Nigel Lawson</PERSON>. 
"There are a lot more downward revisions of earnings forecasts than upward revisions," said <PERSON>Abby Joseph Cohen</PERSON>, a market strategist at <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert</ORGANIZATION>. "People are questioning corporate profits as a pillar of support for the equity market." 
<ORGANIZATION>HEALTHDYNE Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, said its subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION>Home Nutritional Services Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, registered with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> an initial public offering of four million shares of common.
In search of buyers for upscale department-store chains such as <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale</ORGANIZATION>'s and <ORGANIZATION>Saks Fifth Avenue</ORGANIZATION>, investment bankers are turning to -- who else?
But operating a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> department-store chain would be very difficult," says <PERSON>Motoyuki Homma</PERSON>, managing director of the international division at <ORGANIZATION>Mitsukoshi Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s leading department stores. 
The Japanese have watched the Europeans and Canadians stumble in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market, and they fret that business practices that have won them huge profits at home won't translate into success in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
After <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's recent headline-grabbing acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Pictures</ORGANIZATION>, many say it makes good political sense to lie low. "It's a question of timing," says <PERSON>Mayumi Takayama</PERSON>, managing director of international operations at <ORGANIZATION>Isetan Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> department store. 
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>B.A.T Industries PLC</ORGANIZATION> is trying to unwind its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> retailing operations, which include such well-known stores as <ORGANIZATION>Saks Fifth Avenue</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Marshall Field</PERSON>'s, <ORGANIZATION>Breuners</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ivey's</ORGANIZATION>.
And debt-ridden <ORGANIZATION>Campeau Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> is giving up the 17-store <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale</ORGANIZATION>'s group. 
"Every department store in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> is taking a look," says <PERSON>Mike Allen</PERSON>, a retail analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Barclay's de Zoete Wedd Securities</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>) <LOCATION>Ltd</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Allen</PERSON>, however, doesn't think that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> is about to embark on a major buying binge. 
Nonetheless, speculation heated up yesterday when <ORGANIZATION>Tokyu Department Store Co.</ORGANIZATION> confirmed a report in <PERSON>Nihon Keizai Shimbun</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s leading business daily, that <PERSON>Tokyu</PERSON> is talking with <PERSON>Campeau</PERSON> about buying <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale's</ORGANIZATION>.
Nor is Tokyu the only Japanese retailer interested in <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale</ORGANIZATION>'s, which bankers in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> estimate could cost between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.
Seven Japanese department-store groups were approached by investment bankers representing <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, <PERSON>Marvin Traub</PERSON>, and more than half are seeking additional information on the group, bankers say. 
What <PERSON>Mr. Traub</PERSON> is hoping to put together, investment bankers say, is a management-led group to buy the <ORGANIZATION>New York</ORGANIZATION> department-store group that he heads from <ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Federated Department Stores</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary.
Paying off that debt put such a squeeze on <ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION> and its stores that <ORGANIZATION>Federated</ORGANIZATION> decided to sell off the jewels of its retailing empire, including <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale's</ORGANIZATION>. 
Hoping to avoid another takeover, <PERSON>Mr. Traub</PERSON> retained <ORGANIZATION>Blackstone Group</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION> to help him find partners for a management-led buy-out.
Ideally, investment bankers say, he wants to get backing from a Japanese department store and a European department store to forge a global retailing network. "When you look at the economics, <ORGANIZATION>Traub</ORGANIZATION> needs a Japanese and a <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> partner to make it work," says one investment banker who follows the retail industry. "Looking only at a narrow <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> strategy isn't where it's at." 
Last March, <LOCATION>Isetan</LOCATION> invested 1.5 billion yen ($10.6 million) in a venture with <ORGANIZATION>Barney's Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, an up-scale <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> specialty clothier.
The first <LOCATION>Barney</LOCATION>'s shop is scheduled to open in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> next year. 
And <ORGANIZATION>Mitsukoshi</ORGANIZATION> recently increased its equity stake in <ORGANIZATION>Tiffany & Co.</ORGANIZATION> to 13%.
Through the longstanding relationship between the two companies, <ORGANIZATION>Mitsukoshi</ORGANIZATION> has opened 22 <ORGANIZATION>Tiffany</ORGANIZATION> shops in its stores and arcades in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
Plans are under way to open a <ORGANIZATION>Tiffany</ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> to cater to Japanese tourists; it will be run mostly by <ORGANIZATION>Mitsukoshi</ORGANIZATION>. 
Some industry observers say that <ORGANIZATION>Mitsukoshi</ORGANIZATION>'s classy image makes it a possible match for <ORGANIZATION>Saks Fifth Avenue</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Takashimaya Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s oldest department store, is another name that keeps popping up as a potential fit with <PERSON>Saks</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Eiji Nakazato</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Takashimaya</LOCATION> general manager, admits that his company's image is similar to <ORGANIZATION>Saks</ORGANIZATION>'s and that there is some interest in the idea.
Council member <ORGANIZATION>Cardinal Gerald Carter</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> told <ORGANIZATION>Vatican Radio</ORGANIZATION>: "Now that we say we covered our deficit this year, people are going to relax and say well that's fine, the Holy See is out of the hole.
Former President <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON> is to visit <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> at the invitation of the government beginning Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> announced.
There will be no sightseeing, no shopping and no social events." <PERSON>Mr. Nixon</PERSON>'s office said the former president "expects to have one-on-one discussions with the major Chinese leaders" and will give his assessment of those leaders to President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> upon his return. 
The poll, conducted for the Dutch daily <ORGANIZATION>De Telegraaf</ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION>Gallup International</ORGANIZATION> said 81% of Dutch people supported <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> was the second most pro-NATO country with 78% supporting the alliance, followed by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> with 75%, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> with 71%, <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> with 69% and <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> with 63%.
The spaghetti is made by the <ORGANIZATION>Al Ghazel Macaroni Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Bethlehem</LOCATION> and is marketed in a package decorated with green, black, red and white stripes. 
British postal authorities say they have uncovered a large-scale scheme where unscrupulous stamp dealers chemically removed stamp cancellations, regummed the stamps and sold them to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> collectors or, in large lots, to <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> businesses.
<PERSON>Akio Tanii</PERSON>, president of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.</ORGANIZATION>, presented the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> consul general in <LOCATION>Osaka</LOCATION> with a $1 million check to help <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s earthquake victims.
The company's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION>Matsushita Electric Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, had donated over $35,000 worth of Matsushita-made flashlights and batteries to residents shortly after the disaster, a company spokesman said.
<ORGANIZATION>Sumitomo Bank</ORGANIZATION> donated $500,000, <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> prefecture $15,000 and the city of <LOCATION>Osaka</LOCATION> $10,000. 
But <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION>Xinhua News Agency</ORGANIZATION> reported that the number of foreign businessmen was greater than the previous fair -- without providing statistics. 
In another sign of glasnost, <PERSON>Alexander Solzhenitsyn</PERSON>'s long-banned chronicle of Soviet repression, "The <ORGANIZATION>Gulag Archipelago</ORGANIZATION>," is now recommended reading in one 11th-grade <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> history class. . . . British customs officers said they'd arrested eight men sneaking 111 rare snakes into <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> -- including one man who strapped a pair of boa constrictors under his armpits.
A customs official said the arrests followed a "Snake Day" at <ORGANIZATION>Utrecht University</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, an event used by some collectors as an opportunity to obtain rare snakes. 
In 1984, <PERSON>Howard Conant</PERSON>, a director of <ORGANIZATION>Valspar Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, donated to <ORGANIZATION>Goodwill Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> an eight-acre site on the city's west side, where <PERSON>Valspar</PERSON> had operated a paint factory.
Six months later, <PERSON>Goodwill</PERSON> says, it was stunned to learn from the <ORGANIZATION>Illinois Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON>Mr. Conant</PERSON>'s gift was contaminated and that the charity, as the current owner, could be held responsible for any cleanup costs.
"It's a toxic time bomb," says <PERSON>James D. Wadsworth</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Goodwill</ORGANIZATION>, which is independent of sister Goodwills around the country.
Paying even a portion of the cleanup costs could bankrupt the charity, which has annual revenue of $6 million, says <PERSON>Russell B. Selman</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Goodwill</ORGANIZATION>'s lawyer.
In a pending lawsuit, the charity has asked a federal district court in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> to rescind its donation agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Valspar</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Mr. Conant</PERSON>. 
Donating contaminated property allows companies to share the costs of their environmental problems, says <PERSON>Laurence Molloy</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Molloy Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, an environmental management firm in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
Since 1984, non-cash donations, which include real estate, have accounted for 20% of corporate giving, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Conference Board</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> trade group that tracks corporate giving.
Since June, the <ORGANIZATION>Salvation Army</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> division has refused real-estate donations unless the donor first conducts an environmental assessment of the property. "We tend to be very careful," says <PERSON>Carl Schoch</PERSON>, property secretary for the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> division. "We're aware an owner might want to get rid of" a hazardous site. 
At the <ORGANIZATION>Nature Conservancy</ORGANIZATION>, site inspections, which have been mandatory since the late '70s, "are now specifically geared to looking for hazardous-waste problems," says <PERSON>Michael Dennis</PERSON>, general counsel for the <LOCATION>Rosalind</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, group. 
Since receiving the <ORGANIZATION>Valspar</ORGANIZATION> gift, the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Goodwill</ORGANIZATION> has virtually closed the door on property donations, says its president, <PERSON>Mr. Wadsworth</PERSON>.
In its suit, <ORGANIZATION>Goodwill</ORGANIZATION> claims that <ORGANIZATION>Valspar</ORGANIZATION>, a paint and varnish maker based in <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Mr. Conant</PERSON> haven't met terms of the donation agreement or environmental regulations about property transfers. 
<ORGANIZATION>Valspar</ORGANIZATION>, which had leased the property from <PERSON>Mr. Conant</PERSON>, says it has complied with all requests from the <ORGANIZATION>Illinois EPA</ORGANIZATION> about the site. "We have empathy for the unfortunate situation Goodwill is in, but that doesn't mean a legal obligation attaches to it," says <PERSON>Leo G. Stern</PERSON>, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION>Valspar</ORGANIZATION>.
Both <ORGANIZATION>Valspar</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Mr. Conant</PERSON> argue that <ORGANIZATION>Goodwill</ORGANIZATION> doesn't have standing to bring its suit. 
The state of <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> has sued Goodwill for a share of the cleanup costs at a second site, a former paint factory in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>.
That property was donated to Goodwill by <ORGANIZATION>Artra Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Northbrook</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, company with interests in fashion jewelry and accessories.
That seems unlikely, though, because "everyone wants an exemption," says <PERSON>David Van Slyke</PERSON>, a lawyer with the enforcement and compliance division of the federal <ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION>. "But the agency is trying to be equitable.
We're not trying to jam people when they are an innocent party." For now, <ORGANIZATION>Goodwill</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Wadsworth</PERSON> lectures other charities about accepting land donations. "It's supposed to be a gift," he says. "But it can turn out to be a liability."

Separately, <PERSON>Maclean Hunter</PERSON> said third-quarter net income fell 12% to 19.2 million Canadian dollars ($16.4 million), or 12 Canadian cents (10.2 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> cents) a share, from C$21.9 million, or 14 Canadian cents a share, a year ago.
<PERSON>Di Giorgio</PERSON>, a food wholesaler and building products maker, is seeking alternatives to an unsolicited $32-a-share tender offer of <ORGANIZATION>DIG Acquisition Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Rose Partners Limited Partnership</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Robert Mellor</PERSON>, <PERSON>Di Giorgio</PERSON>'s executive vice president, said the company stands to reap more money through the sale of individual units to others than by accepting <ORGANIZATION>DIG</ORGANIZATION>'s offer. 
<ORGANIZATION>Rio Algom Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> said it agreed to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Uranium Resources Inc.</ORGANIZATION> for $2.55 a share, or about $66 million. 
The closely held uranium producer also said it agreed to pay <ORGANIZATION>Rio Algom</ORGANIZATION> $2 million plus expenses if the proposed deal isn't completed and <ORGANIZATION>Uranium Resources</ORGANIZATION> enters certain other transactions. 
Separately, <PERSON>Rio Algom</PERSON> said it agreed to pay <ORGANIZATION>Whittaker Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> $30 million to acquire Whittaker Metals, a metals distribution business with four facilities in the <LOCATION>Southwest</LOCATION> region. 
<PERSON>Rio</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Whittaker Metals</ORGANIZATION>' geographical base complements <PERSON>Rio</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Vincent Metals</ORGANIZATION> business, with outlets mainly in central and southeastern states. 
<ORGANIZATION>National Medical Enterprises Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, said the completion of the spinoff of its long-term care operations will be delayed until early next year because of regulatory complexities. 
The new company, <ORGANIZATION>Hillhaven Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, is expected to have about $150 million in equity, a 2-1 debt-to-equity ratio and to be 10%-owned by <ORGANIZATION>NME</ORGANIZATION>. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>National Medical</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at $36.125, down 25 cents. 
The statement didn't address the issue of a possible change at the top management as Chairman <PERSON>Lorenzo Necci</PERSON> is expected to be appointed chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi</ORGANIZATION>, succeeding <PERSON>Franco Reviglio</PERSON> whose term expires in November.
<ORGANIZATION>ENI</ORGANIZATION>, the state energy concern, is <ORGANIZATION>Enichem</ORGANIZATION>'s parent. 
According to local news reports, <PERSON>Gabriele Cagliari</PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION>ENI</ORGANIZATION>'s executive council, is a front runner to take over <PERSON>Mr. Necci</PERSON>'s post at <LOCATION>Enimont</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Paramount Pictures Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, named <PERSON>Arthur Cohen</PERSON>, executive vice president of advertising at <ORGANIZATION>Revlon Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, as the new president of marketing for its motion picture group. 
A few years ago, for example, <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which owns 49% of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, sent one of its soft drink marketing executives, <PERSON>Peter Sealey</PERSON>, to run marketing at the studio.
<ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> is in the process of being acquired by <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Cohen</PERSON> fills a post vacated earlier this year by <PERSON>Sidney Ganis</PERSON> when <PERSON>Mr. Ganis</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Paramount</ORGANIZATION>'s head of distribution, <PERSON>Barry London</PERSON>, were named co-presidents of the motion picture group.
<ORGANIZATION>Paramount Pictures</ORGANIZATION> is a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Paramount Communications Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
Prior to joining <ORGANIZATION>Revlon</ORGANIZATION> in 1986, <PERSON>Mr. Cohen</PERSON> held a number of marketing and advertising posts.
From 1982 to 1985, he was president of the ill-fated Tele1st venture of the <ORGANIZATION>ABC Video Enterprises</ORGANIZATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION>Capital Cities/ABC Inc</ORGANIZATION>. Tele1st attempted to sell movies via a service that enabled subscribers with videocassette recorders to tape movies delivered on a special scrambled channel overnight. 
Democratic leaders have bottled up President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s capital-gains tax cut in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and may be able to prevent a vote on the issue indefinitely. 
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON>George Mitchell</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>) said he intends to use <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> procedures to force advocates of the tax cut to come up with at least 60 votes before they can address the issue.
<PERSON>Sen. Bob Packwood</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>), the leading Republican proponent of the tax cut, didn't disagree. "I'm not sure what's going to happen," he said.
<PERSON>Sen. Packwood</PERSON> has offered his capital-gains-cut package as an amendment to a bill, now pending in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, that would authorize aid to <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>.
"This is serious business; we're serious about a capital-gains reduction," said <PERSON>Kansas Sen. Robert Dole</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>'s Republican leader. "The strategy is `Let's vote. ' " 
A <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is "generally supportive" of the <LOCATION>Packwood</LOCATION> plan. 
Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON> named Foreign Secretary <PERSON>John Major</PERSON> to succeed <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>.
Sir <PERSON>Geoffrey Howe</PERSON>, deputy prime minister, rushed out a statement in the <ORGANIZATION>House of Commons</ORGANIZATION> that the government's economic and monetary policies would remain "unchanged." Meanwhile, <PERSON>Sir Alan Walters</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>'s controversial economic adviser and <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>'s nemesis, also announced his resignation. 
And brokers were bracing for a grueling Friday in financial markets here. "You're going to get quite a major fall in the equity market and the gilt markets," said <PERSON>Gwyn Hacche</PERSON>, <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> economist with <ORGANIZATION>James Capel & Co.</ORGANIZATION> "Markets hate uncertainty." 
The two men clashed bitterly over the importance of exchange rates in setting monetary policy and the wisdom of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> fully joining the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary System</ORGANIZATION>, which links together the major currencies in the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Neil Kinnock</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Labor Party</ORGANIZATION> leader, dubbed the 46-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Major</PERSON> a "lap dog" unlikely to veer from his boss's strongly held views, as <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON> sometimes did. 
From the standpoint of the financial markets, however, the prime minister's positions seem murky -- in large part because she has presided over dueling advisers for the last six months. "I don't know where Thatcher stands," said <PERSON>Paul Horne</PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION>Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. "She's played such a cat-and-mouse game with her advisers." 
In his letter to <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON> stated: "The successful conduct of economic policy is possible only if there is, and is seen to be, full agreement between the prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer.
Six months ago, the <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> prime minister's two senior cabinet members -- <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>, chancellor since 1983, and <PERSON>Sir Geoffrey</PERSON>, then the foreign secretary -- both supported <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s early entry into the <ORGANIZATION>EMS</ORGANIZATION>.
With <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON> out of the cabinet, and <PERSON>Sir Geoffrey</PERSON> in the less-influential job of deputy prime minister, there's little to counter <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>'s innate suspicion of the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>'s exchange-rate mechanism.
Indeed, the final fracas in the Lawson-Walters battle involved the <ORGANIZATION>EMS</ORGANIZATION>. Sir <PERSON>Alan</PERSON>, who also works in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, as a consultant to the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> and a fellow at the <ORGANIZATION>American Enterprise Institute</ORGANIZATION>, said in a article to be published in a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economic journal that the <ORGANIZATION>EMS</ORGANIZATION> was "half-baked." 
It not only conflicted with <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>'s views but ran counter to the position <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> took at the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> last June.
There, she said that <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> would join the <ORGANIZATION>EMS</ORGANIZATION> once the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> had completely liberalized restrictions on capital movements and exchange controls, and once <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s inflation rate had fallen into line with the rest of the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>. Economists expect those conditions to be met in 1990 or 1991. 
<PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON> stated in a <ORGANIZATION>House of Commons</ORGANIZATION> debate this week that Sir Alan's views "aren't the view of the government." And in a subsequent television interview, he said, "I think it is right that advisers do not talk or write in public." 
The <ORGANIZATION>EMS</ORGANIZATION> views of <PERSON>Mr. Major</PERSON>, who served as <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>'s deputy in 1987, aren't fully known.
Speaking in the <ORGANIZATION>House of Commons</ORGANIZATION> last night, he said of <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>, "I was proud to serve in his team and proud that he has been and will remain a good friend." 
<PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON> carefully watched exchange rates and stood ready to increase <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> interest rates when the pound slid too sharply against the dollar or the mark.
Last summer, when the skirmishing became obvious, <ORGANIZATION>Smith Barney</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Horne</PERSON> said that the antipathies were "adding confusion to an already murky situation" in which sterling was becoming an increasingly volatile currency. "I question the strategy of having an alternate economic adviser," he added. 
<PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>'s ties with <PERSON>Sir Alan</PERSON> were cemented during her first term, when the straight-talking economist served for three years as a key adviser.

<ORGANIZATION>Delta Air Lines</ORGANIZATION>, in a move that could help it thwart the kind of takeover attempts that have bedeviled other airlines this year, agreed to sell about 5% of its stock to <ORGANIZATION>Singapore Airlines Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 
As part of a 10-year marketing agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Singapore Airlines</ORGANIZATION> announced yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> also agreed to spend about $183 million -- the same amount <ORGANIZATION>Singapore Airlines</ORGANIZATION> will spend for its <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> shares -- to buy a similar stake in <ORGANIZATION>Singapore Airlines</ORGANIZATION>. 
Under the terms of equity cross-purchase agreements, <ORGANIZATION>Singapore Airlines</ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy 2.5 million shares of <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> common stock for 110% of its closing price for the four days surrounding its purchase announcement.
<ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy the same dollar amount of <ORGANIZATION>Singapore Airlines</ORGANIZATION> shares. 
<ORGANIZATION>Singapore Airlines</ORGANIZATION> also agreed not to transfer its <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> shares and to vote those shares in the same proportion as all other shares are voted or as recommended by <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION>'s board.
<ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> made a similar pact regarding its <ORGANIZATION>Singapore Airlines</ORGANIZATION> holdings. 
An added benefit for <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> is that its agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Singapore Airlines</ORGANIZATION> provides a toehold in the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>, where <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> airlines face the best possibility of expansion. 
The <ORGANIZATION>California Department of Insurance</ORGANIZATION> charged <ORGANIZATION>Farmers Insurance Exchange</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mid-Century Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> with discriminating against three groups of automobile insurance customers. 
The department didn't specify how many consumers have been hurt by the alleged discriminatory practices, saying only that they "affect a substantial number of people." The department claims, however, that Farmers and <PERSON>Mid-Century</PERSON>, both members of the <ORGANIZATION>Farmers Group of Insurance Cos.</ORGANIZATION>, are steering customers who might qualify for Farmers policies toward higher-priced Mid-Century policies.
"As <ORGANIZATION>Mid-Century</ORGANIZATION>'s rates are up to 40 percent higher than Farmers for the same coverage, we have a situation in which the companies effectively raise rates for the new business by denying coverage in Farmers," <PERSON>Roxani Gillespie</PERSON>, the state's insurance commissioner, said in a prepared statement. "And that's discrimination in our book." 
<ORGANIZATION>Farmers Group of Insurance</ORGANIZATION> is a unit of <ORGANIZATION>B.A.T Industries PLC</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange's Exchange Stock Portfolio</ORGANIZATION>, which allows investors to trade all 500 stocks in <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor</ORGANIZATION>'s index in a single transaction, received permanent regulatory approval Wednesday.
However, the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> will review three rules regarding <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s basket trading over the next six months. 
The <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> also approved the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Board Options Exchange</ORGANIZATION>'s basket product.
Only nine <ORGANIZATION>ESP</ORGANIZATION> contracts traded on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> -- equivalent to about one million shares of stock, with a value of about $45 million. "It was a slow start, but we expected it would be," said <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Richard Grasso</PERSON>. "We were generally pleased with the way the systems acted." 
The <ORGANIZATION>CBOE</ORGANIZATION>'s basket requires a minimum of $1.7 million a trade, compared with a $5 million minimum for the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> basket. 
<PERSON>David Hall</PERSON>, vice president at the <ORGANIZATION>CBOE</ORGANIZATION>, said five to six firms traded the stock basket product, located on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION>CBOE</ORGANIZATION> near the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500-stock index options pit. 
Many of those issues-such as <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Procter & Gamble</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Merck</PERSON> -- are in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 
Third-quarter earnings were on the low end of analysts' forecasts, and the company disclosed that it had uncovered two technical flaws in <ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION>'s new microprocessor, which could cause delays in shipments of some new <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION> products.
"When you see what happened to <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION>, it is completely (numbing) for the mentality of the market," said <PERSON>Jack Solomon</PERSON>, technical analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Bear Stearns</ORGANIZATION>. "It is hard for the mind to digest that what was the leading stock is now the one leading you down the tubes." 
Futures-related selling pushed the industrial average about 45 points lower in the morning as rumors about <ORGANIZATION>RJR Nabisco</ORGANIZATION>'s pending sale of its <ORGANIZATION>Del Monte</ORGANIZATION> foods unit spread through the trading pits in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>.
However, <PERSON>Donald Selkin</PERSON>, head of futures research at <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities</ORGANIZATION>, said that the stock market appears to be poised for a round of futures-related selling this morning, given the discrepancies between futures and stocks at the close. 
The <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> started trading its new "basket" product yesterday, with which institutions can buy and sell all the stocks in the <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor</ORGANIZATION>'s 500-stock index in one trade.
In a sign of the credit needs among market makers during the 190-point plunge on Oct. 13, the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Bank of New York</ORGANIZATION> said yesterday that loans by <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s nine largest banks for the financing of securities positions rose $786 million, to $6.6 billion during the week ending Oct. 18. 
Among other computer stocks, <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines</ORGANIZATION> fell 1 1/8 to 100 3/4 on 1.7 million shares, <ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment</ORGANIZATION> droped 2 1/4 to 88 and <ORGANIZATION>Unisys</ORGANIZATION> lost 1/2 to 17.

<ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris</ORGANIZATION> fell 1 7/8 to 41 5/8 on 3.7 million shares, reflecting the possibility that <PERSON>Anheuser-Busch</PERSON>'s decision could have a negative impact on results at its <ORGANIZATION>Miller Brewing</ORGANIZATION> unit. 
Other consumer stocks coming under selling pressure included <ORGANIZATION>Procter & Gamble</ORGANIZATION>, which went down 3 1/4 to 126 3/4; <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola Co.</ORGANIZATION>, down 1 3/8 to 71 1/8, <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's</ORGANIZATION>, down 1/4 to 31 1/4; PepsiCo, off 1 to 60 3/8, and <PERSON>Merck</PERSON>, down 1 1/2 to 76 3/4.

<ORGANIZATION>Arnold C. Pohs</ORGANIZATION> was officially named president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Cellular Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a provider of management, financing and operating services to cellular-telephone systems. 
<PERSON>Mr. Pohs</PERSON>, previously executive vice president and chief operating officer, was named interim president and chief executive officer after <PERSON>David M. Harrold</PERSON>, a company founder, resigned from the posts for personal reasons in August. 
Cellular said <PERSON>Robert J. Lunday Jr.</PERSON>, its chairman and another founder, resigned from the company's board to pursue the sale of his telephone company, <ORGANIZATION>Big Sandy Telecommunications Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
WHO'S NEWS: <ORGANIZATION>Arthur Price</ORGANIZATION> resigned as president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>MTM Enterprises Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Studio-City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, entertainment concern.
He co-founded the company with <ORGANIZATION>Grant Tinker</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Mary Tyler Moore</PERSON> in 1969.
<ORGANIZATION>MTM</ORGANIZATION> is a unit of British-based <ORGANIZATION>TVS Entertainment PLC</ORGANIZATION>, whose chief executive officer, <PERSON>James Gatward</PERSON>, will oversee the company until a successor is named. 
The commission said Coats must first dispose of its interest in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s domestic sewing thread industry and its shares in the <ORGANIZATION>Gutermann Group</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, said net income fell to $110.9 million, or $5.11 a share, from $402.4 million, or $18.68 a share.
The company said its third-quarter results reflected the recent sharp climb in <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stock to $282 a share as of Sept. 29, sparked by bids from <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON> and a labor-management buy-out group.
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> shares rose $9.75 to $170.75 on volume of 1.1 million shares. 
Separately, the leadership of <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>'s machinists union met to discuss the possibility of proposing a recapitalization to <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>'s board.
An <ORGANIZATION>American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ORGANIZATION> unit, <ORGANIZATION>AT&T Nassau Metals Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said it was soliciting bids for its <LOCATION>Gaston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Chandler</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, metal-processing operations, which produce annual revenue of about $400 million. 
The unit didn't disclose any asking price, and an <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION>Parsippany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, said he couldn't supply one.
An industry analyst, <ORGANIZATION>Robert B. Morris III</ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> office, said the value of the operations isn't clear because <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> hasn't disclosed their book value or earnings. 
The <LOCATION>Gaston</LOCATION> operation processes metal scrap and supplies copper rod, largely to <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> itself.
No value was given for the transaction, which will create the sort of financial-industrial tandem common in <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
Although <PERSON>Thomson</PERSON>'s banking activities will become a <ORGANIZATION>Credit Lyonnais</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, they are to remain a separate entity and, according to sources, will continue to handle <PERSON>Thomson</PERSON>'s own international financing needs.
Thomson-CSF Finance, the largest finance unit of any French industrial company, also will gain access to products offered by <ORGANIZATION>Credit Lyonnais</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s secondbiggest commercial bank in terms of assets, behind <ORGANIZATION>Banque Nationale de Paris</ORGANIZATION>. 
The accord will strengthen <ORGANIZATION>Credit Lyonnais</ORGANIZATION>'s corporate financial affairs because of <ORGANIZATION>Thomson-CSF Finance</ORGANIZATION>'s expertise in using hedging and treasury-management products. 
Regional thrift regulators charged that phone calls were bugged during the examination of <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln Savings & Loan Association</ORGANIZATION> and that federal officials in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> delayed <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln</ORGANIZATION>'s seizure until its $2.5 billion cost made it the most expensive thrift failure ever. 
"Clearly, we were shot in the back . . . as we battled to protect the taxpayers," said <PERSON>William Black</PERSON>, acting district counsel for the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> region of thrift regulators. 
In a day of extraordinary testimony before the <ORGANIZATION>House Banking Committee</ORGANIZATION>, officials from the <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco Office of Thrift Supervision</ORGANIZATION> also testified that a Big Eight accounting firm, <ORGANIZATION>Arthur Andersen & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, participated in back-dating loan documents and that the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> officials even agreed in one document not to prosecute <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> over certain infractions. 
<PERSON>Alan Cranston</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>) and <PERSON>Dennis DeConcini</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>), who are being scrutinized for intervening on behalf of <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>American Continental Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz</LOCATION>.
The officials said <PERSON>Sen. DeConcini</PERSON> and an aide to <PERSON>Sen. Cranston</PERSON> called <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> state thrift officials to press for a sale of <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION>, instead of its seizure. 
Witnesses said the room in which <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> examiners were auditing <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> this past spring was bugged.
According to a government memo, regulators who took control of the thrift in August discovered that a phone line in <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, had been "compromised" to allow calls to be monitored on other extensions.
The regional officials said <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s chief thrift regulator, <PERSON>Danny Wall</PERSON>, and his principal lieutenants repeatedly ignored warnings that <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> was being operated in a reckless manner, certain to cause its failure.
They also accused <PERSON>Mr. Wall</PERSON> of holding improper meetings with <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION> officials, while refusing to listen to field examiners. 
Members of the <ORGANIZATION>Banking Committee</ORGANIZATION> generally received the regional officials as bureaucratic heroes and sharply criticized their <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> bosses, who had relieved them of their responsibility for <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> two years before the thrift's parent filed for bankruptcy-law protection. 
<ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Henry Gonzalez</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>) said <PERSON>Mr. Wall</PERSON> "willingly cut the legs out from under his regulatory troops in the middle of the battle," and renewed his call for <PERSON>Mr. Wall</PERSON> to step aside.
Rep. <PERSON>Joseph Kennedy</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>) said, "The higher up in the regulatory process, the more corrupt it would appear." 
Separately, other <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> thrift officials disputed the regional examiners' statement that they had called specifically for the seizure of <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION> in 1987, saying that it was only one option they presented. 
Over two years, until April 1986, $1 billion in loans were approved, even though <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> had no written loan standards, said <PERSON>Mike Patriarca</PERSON>, acting principal supervisory agent with the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Thrift Supervision</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Leonard Bickwit</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> attorney for <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>, conceded that some memos had been written after the fact.
The matter is under active criminal investigation at the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Black</PERSON> said. 
The hearings also disclosed that <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> officials promised in May 1988 not to launch any civil or criminal actions based on an examination in which regional officials concluded that <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> was being operated in an unsafe and unsound manner. 
<PERSON>Cranston</PERSON> and <PERSON>DeConcini</PERSON>, who received campaign contributions from <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION> Chairman <PERSON>Charles Keating Jr.</PERSON>, arranged for telephone calls on their behalf to state thrift regulators.
The officials said both calls encouraged a sale of <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> to an outside buyer, which <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> sought, rather than putting it in receivership. 
An aide to <PERSON>Sen. DeConcini</PERSON> said the phone call to a top <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> thrift regulator was "informational." 
A <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> bankruptcy judge has temporarily stopped the <ORGANIZATION>Resolution Trust Corp.</ORGANIZATION> from placing an insolvent thrift institution under government control. 
The company is scheduled to appear before federal bankruptcy <PERSON>Judge Tina L. Brozman</PERSON> Thursday to ask her to impose a 60-day preliminary injunction on the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Thrift Supervision</ORGANIZATION>, the enforcement arm of the <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Deltacorp</ORGANIZATION> hopes within 60 days it will be able to sell the thrift, says its lawyer <PERSON>David M. Friedman</PERSON>, a partner with <ORGANIZATION>Gordon Hurwitz Butowsky Weitzen Shalov & Wein</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
If <ORGANIZATION>Deltacorp</ORGANIZATION> prevails, similarly situated companies will be able to use Chapter 11 to thwart President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s program to restructure the trouble S&L industry.
Passed early this year, the <ORGANIZATION>Financial Institutions Reform</ORGANIZATION>, Recovery, and Enforcement Act authorizes the <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION> to declare troubled thrift institutions insolvent and place them in receivership.
The <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION> was on the verge of placing <ORGANIZATION>Colonial Savings Bank of Roselle</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Deltacorp</ORGANIZATION>, into receivership.
This week <ORGANIZATION>Deltacorp</ORGANIZATION> persuaded <PERSON>Judge Brozman</PERSON> to issue a temporary restraining order, arguing that before its thrift was taken over the apparent conflict between the two federal laws should be resolved. 
According to <PERSON>Mr. Friedman</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION>'s pending takeover would impair the company's ability under Chapter 11 to recoup loses by putting its subsidiary up for bid.
<PERSON>Mr. Friedman</PERSON> claims <ORGANIZATION>Deltacorp</ORGANIZATION> estimates that by selling the thrift it could make about $23 million.
"If the court were to issue the injunction, it would set a significant precedent," says <PERSON>Mr. Friedman</PERSON>, who says he doesn't know how many other companies are in a position to use the bankruptcy law as a shelter against <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION> takeovers. 
<PERSON>Jerome Kowalski</PERSON>, a partner with <ORGANIZATION>Parker Chapin Flattau & Klimpl</ORGANIZATION> who has clients in situations similar to <ORGANIZATION>Deltacorp</ORGANIZATION>, says lawyers would be "foolish not to tell clients to follow" the <ORGANIZATION>Deltacorp</ORGANIZATION> strategy. 
That's the conclusion of a study by <PERSON>Daniel Meador</PERSON>, a law professor at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Meador</PERSON>, a former assistant attorney general, criticizes what he calls "inordinate delays" in filling federal judgeships and suggests the creation of a permanent office on judicial nominations within the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>. 
Federal judges in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, and other areas complained recently that long-standing vacancies have contributed to mounting backlogs of cases.
<PERSON>Mr. Meador</PERSON>, whose study appears in the fall issue of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia's Journal of Law & Politics</ORGANIZATION>, writes that "it is not rare for two or more years to pass before the administration sends a nomination to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>." His study covers the years 1979 to 1988. 
Under Attorney General <PERSON>Dick Thornburgh</PERSON>, a committee of ten senior <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> officials evaluate potential judicial nominees and send recommendations to the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>.
But a spokesman for the the attorney general said the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> contributed to the problem by failing to act on nominations made during the final months of the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> DISTRICT JUDGE upholds <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s "Son of Sam" law. 
The state law, designed to prevent lawbreakers from profitting from such things as books and movies about their crimes, survived its first federal challenge in a ruling by <PERSON>Judge John F. Keenan</PERSON> in federal court in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
A spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION>Simon & Schuster</ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> company would appeal the ruling. 
The <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> law firm, the world's largest, will open the first Soviet-accredited office of a foreign law firm in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> later this year. 
<ORGANIZATION>Coudert Brothers</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> law firm, and <ORGANIZATION>Arnold & Porter</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Heron</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Burchette</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Ruckert & Rothwell</ORGANIZATION>, both in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, have had lawyers in the Soviet Union under the auspices of companies' trade offices or in unofficial capacities.
It became the first foreign firm with an <ORGANIZATION>Eastern European</ORGANIZATION> branch when it opened in <LOCATION>Budapest</LOCATION> two years ago. 
Three lawyers, headed by partner <PERSON>Paul J. Melling</PERSON>, will be in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> full-time.
After nine years in the state judiciary, <PERSON>William R. Quinlan</PERSON>, 49 years old, has joined the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION>Phelan, Pope & John</ORGANIZATION> as a partner.
In a Oct. 23 resignation letter to <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>James R. Thompson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Quinlan</PERSON> said he could no longer sit on the bench and fulfill financial responsibilities to his family.
<PERSON>Mr. Quinlan</PERSON> was appointed to the <ORGANIZATION>Illinois Appellate Court</ORGANIZATION> in 1985.
He served as a <ORGANIZATION>Circuit Court</ORGANIZATION> judge in <LOCATION>Cook County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, and corporation counsel for the city of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. 
The suit also alleges <ORGANIZATION>Amvest</ORGANIZATION> created a character called the <ORGANIZATION>Happy Hampster</ORGANIZATION> which it is trying to pass off as a <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> character. 
"This was an excellent response to a new security," said <PERSON>Michael E. Basham</PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>. "We were very pleased." 
"There's no doubt that the auction went better than expected," said <PERSON>William Sullivan Jr.</PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Eishi Wakabayashi</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Nippon Kangyo</ORGANIZATION> executive vice president, confirmed that the firm "bought quite a bit" yesterday and last week, but he declined to elaborate.
<PERSON>Joel Kazis</PERSON>, head of government trading at <ORGANIZATION>Smith Barney</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Harris Upham & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, said the billion dollar bid "helped to support the market going into the Refcorp auction" and "showed that there are real buyers for long bonds." 
The <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year bond, which jumped 1/2 point on the <ORGANIZATION>Nippon Kangyo</ORGANIZATION> bid, ended 1/8 point higher, or up $1.25 for each $1,000 face amount.
Among the big buyers at yesterday's auction was <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Jack Norris</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> executive vice president, said the firm bought a sizable share of the bonds, but he wouldn't be specific.
Meanwhile, the market paid close attention to comments by <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Alan Greenspan</PERSON>, who testified before a congressional hearing.
Among other things, <PERSON>Mr. Greenspan</PERSON> said he endorses a bill by Rep. <PERSON>Stephen Neal</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>) that would require the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> to pursue policies aimed at eliminating inflation within five years. 
As expected, <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.</ORGANIZATION> postponed a $1.15 billion junk bond offering for <ORGANIZATION>TW Services Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Donaldson Lufkin</PERSON> said takeover-related financing is being restructured to include more equity and less debt.
The <ORGANIZATION>Ginnie Mae</ORGANIZATION> 9% issue was yielding 9.32% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> 10-year note held at 1.46 percentage points. 
In derivative markets, the <ORGANIZATION>Federal National Mortgage Association</ORGANIZATION> issued a $300 million real estate mortgage investment conduit backed by its 9% securities through <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
In the new issue arena, underwriters led by <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ORGANIZATION> set the preliminary pricing for $80 million of <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> general obligation bonds, the first offering of such debt by the state since 1986.
Another <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> group had the winning bid for $134.8 million of wastewater system improvement revenue bonds issued by the <LOCATION>Trinity River Authority of Texas</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Louis Sullivan</PERSON>, secretary of <ORGANIZATION>Health and Human Services</ORGANIZATION>, announced the move by the <ORGANIZATION>Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION> after two years of restricted access for the youngest AIDS patients to the only anti-viral drug yet cleared to treat the fatal disease. 
<ORGANIZATION>Burroughs Wellcome</ORGANIZATION> is a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Wellcome PLC</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Dr. Sullivan</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> action "will give many sick children access to a drug that offers promise for improving or even extending their lives." 
Adults with AIDS have had access to <ORGANIZATION>AZT</ORGANIZATION> since the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> approved the drug's usage for adults in March 1987.
<ORGANIZATION>PPG Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it will expand production at its <LOCATION>Barberton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, chemical plant to increase total capacity by 50%. 
One is a strong, vigorous portrayal of <PERSON>Shakespeare</PERSON>'s play; the other is director <PERSON>Gregory Boyd</PERSON>'s overlay of present-day punk rock decadence on old <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION>. 
Last season, <ORGANIZATION>Hartford Stage</ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON>Mark Lamos</PERSON> mounted a production at <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln Center</ORGANIZATION>, and currently two other productions -- one just closed at the Old Globe in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> and another now at the <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> Rep -- overlap with <PERSON>Mr. Boyd</PERSON>'s. 
In the play, the Duke of <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION> despairs over the licentiousness of his subjects and turns over the rule of the city to the puritanical <PERSON>Angelo</PERSON>, hoping he can set things right.
When Angelo hears that the young <PERSON>man Claudio</PERSON> has made his fiancee pregnant before he could marry her, <PERSON>Angelo</PERSON> summarily condemns <PERSON>Claudio</PERSON> to death. 
When, however, <PERSON>Claudio</PERSON>'s sister, <LOCATION>Isabella</LOCATION>, a novitiate in a convent, goes to <PERSON>Angelo</PERSON> to plead her brother's case, the obdurate ruler immediately falls in love with her and, in a supreme act of hypocrisy, demands that <LOCATION>Isabella</LOCATION> yield up her virtue to him in exchange for her brother's life. 
When Isabella (<PERSON>Ellen Lauren</PERSON>) confronts her brother <PERSON>Claudio</PERSON> (<PERSON>Matt Loney</PERSON>) in his cell, explaining the price she has been asked to secure his freedom; when <PERSON>Isabella</PERSON> and the disguised Duke (<PERSON>Philip Kerr</PERSON>) conspire to trick <LOCATION>Angelo</LOCATION>; and when <PERSON>Mariana</PERSON> (<PERSON>Annalee Jefferies</PERSON>), a woman wronged by <PERSON>Angelo</PERSON>, confronts him with his past misdeeds, the performers bring the dramatic high points to life with intense energy and intelligence. 
In his "Measure," <PERSON>Mr. Boyd</PERSON> has "modernized" the pimps and prostitutes of <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION> whom <LOCATION>Angelo</LOCATION> is supposed to bring under control by converting them into transvestites, punk rockers and heavy metal types, with a strong emphasis on leather, chains and porno-inspired costumes.
When the opportunist <ORGANIZATION>Lucio</ORGANIZATION> (<PERSON>Jack Stehlin</PERSON>) visits the convent to inform <PERSON>Isabella</PERSON> of her brother's fate, <PERSON>Lucio</PERSON> not only slaps the mother superior on her rear, but brings along a voluptuous companion (<PERSON>Jill Powell</PERSON>), not in <LOCATION>Shakespeare</LOCATION>'s script, to undulate lasciviously. 
Meanwhile, the pimp <LOCATION>Pompey</LOCATION> (<PERSON>Glen Allen Pruett</PERSON>), dressed in black leather and a prominent codpiece, indulges in enough obscene gestures and pelvic thrusts to launch a space probe. 
The inclusion at one point, for example, of a list of glitzy modern-day malefactors, ranging from <PERSON>Jim Bakker</PERSON> and <PERSON>Leona Helmsley</PERSON> to <PERSON>Zsa Zsa Gabor</PERSON>, is a bid for a cheap laugh unworthy of <PERSON>Mr. Boyd</PERSON>'s ability. 
He succeeded <PERSON>Pat Brown</PERSON>, who was fired by the <ORGANIZATION>Alley</ORGANIZATION> board 18 months ago.
Her dismissal angered many in the regional theater establishment and led <PERSON>Peter Zeisler</PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION>Theatre Communications Group</ORGANIZATION>, to write an editorial in American Theatre magazine condemning the board.
Only time will tell if <PERSON>Mr. Boyd</PERSON> can restore to the Alley the acclaim it received when its founder, <PERSON>Nina Vance</PERSON>, was at the height of her powers.
One <ORGANIZATION>Bancorp</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, buffeted by loan write-downs and expanded loss reserves, reported a net loss of $48.5 million, or $5.92 a share.
<ORGANIZATION>Holyoke</ORGANIZATION>, Mass.-based <ORGANIZATION>Heritage Bancorp</ORGANIZATION>, also hurt by the depressed <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> real estate market, reported a net loss of $8.9 million, or $1.22 a share, compared with net income of $3 million, or 40 cents a share. 
One <ORGANIZATION>Bancorp</ORGANIZATION>, which had warned that it planned to take a $49.8 million loan-loss provision in the third quarter, said it expects things to get worse, but more slowly, in the future. "Barring marked and unanticipated declines in real estate values, we expect our growth rates of nonperforming loans to slow," <PERSON>Vincent E. Furey Jr.</PERSON>, president and chief executive officer, said. 
Chairman <PERSON>Richard B. Covell</PERSON> said he expects that <ORGANIZATION>Heritage</ORGANIZATION> will rebound in the fourth quarter and return to a positive mode of operation in 1990. "We are aggressively pursuing workout strategies with respect to nonperforming assets in an effort to resolve these problems as expeditiously as possible, while simultaneously minimizing losses to the company," he said. 
The <LOCATION>Kremlin</LOCATION> leader unveiled a plan to reduce nuclear weapons in the <LOCATION>Baltic Sea</LOCATION>, including the scrapping of <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>'s nuclear-armed submarines by 1991.

In a letter to Prime Minister <PERSON>Thatcher</PERSON>, the chancellor of the exchequer said he was leaving his cabinet post because "the successful conduct of economic policy" wasn't possible so long as Sir <PERSON>Alan Walters</PERSON> remained as her economic adviser.
Sir <PERSON>Geoffrey Howe</PERSON>, deputy prime minister, said in the <ORGANIZATION>House of Commons</ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s economic and monetary policies would remain "unchanged."

<ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Brady</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> should be given the authority to close the stock markets in a crisis.
Earlier, <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Breeden</PERSON> said he doesn't want such power because it could end up disrupting the markets.

The <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION> proposed to fine KLUC-FM, in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, $2,000 for playing the Prince song "Erotic City" on May 16, 1988, at 7:53 p.m. because the song is allegedly indecent.
And <ORGANIZATION>KLUC</ORGANIZATION>, a part of <ORGANIZATION>Nationwide Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, couldn't be reached.
The <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> telephone directory only lists <ORGANIZATION>KLUC</ORGANIZATION>'s "Concert Hot Line" -- and no one answered the <LOCATION>Hot Line</LOCATION> at midday yesterday. 
For one thing, the <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION> dismissed 51 complaints about indecency because the programs aired material after 8 p.m. -- only seven minutes after <ORGANIZATION>KLUC</ORGANIZATION> played "Erotic City." The <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION> now says 8 p.m. is the time that is all right to begin airing indecent material because children aren't likely listening in great numbers.
"You have to draw some lines," said <PERSON>Robert Pettit</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel. 
<PERSON>Tom Chiusano</PERSON>, vice president and general manager of <ORGANIZATION>WXRK-FM</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION> decision singling out <ORGANIZATION>KLUC</ORGANIZATION> seemed unfair because he estimated probably 500 radio stations have played "Erotic City." But <PERSON>Mr. Chiusano</PERSON> has his own problems.
The <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION> also sent <ORGANIZATION>WXRK</ORGANIZATION> a letter saying it believed one of its shows, the <PERSON>Howard Stern Show</PERSON>, contained indecent material. 
But two years ago, when the agency began its crackdown on indecency, <PERSON>Mr. Stern</PERSON>'s show, which features a lot of gross jokes, was one of the shows cited in the agency's first warning letters to broadcasters. "<PERSON>Howard Stern</PERSON> doesn't broadcast indecent material," said <PERSON>Mr. Chiusano</PERSON>. "He does four hours of contemporaneous humor." 
So far the indecency crackdown has managed to offend both civil libertarians, who say the <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION> has gone too far, and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, which says the <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION> hasn't gone far enough.
In addition to citing the stations in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION> proposed fining radio stations in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> for airing allegedly indecent material before 8 p.m.
"Third-quarter net was on target with expectations," said <PERSON>Andrew Shore</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
The company's retail prestige fragrance division, which includes <PERSON>Giorgio Beverly Hills</PERSON> and <PERSON>Parfums Stern</PERSON>, posted 35% higher sales.
Earlier this month, <PERSON>Avon</PERSON> said it agreed to sell its <ORGANIZATION>Valentino</ORGANIZATION> fragrance business and the inventory of its <ORGANIZATION>Parfums Stern</ORGANIZATION> unit to <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Valentino Group</ORGANIZATION> for about $12.3 million in cash and notes. 
<PERSON>Peter Kalikow</PERSON>, owner and publisher of the <ORGANIZATION>Post</ORGANIZATION>, announced that he would discontinue the edition, which he initially started in the hopes of luring upscale readers and retail advertisers that shunned the more sensational tabloid in favor of the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> and the Daily News. 
When <PERSON>Rupert Murdoch</PERSON> sold the paper to <PERSON>Mr. Kalikow</PERSON>, it was posting losses of $10 million a year by conservative estimates.
<PERSON>Mr. Kalikow</PERSON> and Editor <PERSON>Jerry Nachman</PERSON> assembled employees in the paper's newsroom in lower <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> yesterday afternoon to break the news, which had been rumored in recent weeks.
By closing down the Sunday Post, he said in a statement, the <ORGANIZATION>Post</ORGANIZATION> "foresees a profitable year in 1990." The <ORGANIZATION>Post</ORGANIZATION>'s last Sunday edition will be Nov. 26. 
<PERSON>Mr. Kalikow</PERSON> blamed the demise of the Sunday Post on the soft ad market in the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> area and on low circulation. "The economics just aren't there," he said. 
<ORGANIZATION>While Post</ORGANIZATION> executives had expected circulation would reach 500,000, <PERSON>Valerie Salembier</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Post</ORGANIZATION>, said the Sunday circulation has reached only about 250,000. 
"In any other city, 250,000 would be considered great, but it just wasn't enough in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>," said <PERSON>Ms. Salembier</PERSON>. 
In May, the <ORGANIZATION>Post</ORGANIZATION> said it would scratch all supplements in the Sunday edition, including <ORGANIZATION>USA Weekend magazine</ORGANIZATION>, and cut the $1 price to 40 cents. 
While <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> {<PERSON>Kalikow</PERSON>} has deep pockets, it makes sense to put our resources into our Monday through Saturday product," she said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>, said it offered its hourly workers a 15% raise in wages over two years as a first offer in contract talks. 
A <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said 33,000 manual workers at the company's 21 plants in the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> have been offered 8% in the first year and 7% in the second year. 
But <PERSON>Charlie Whelan</PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION>Amalgamated Engineering Union</ORGANIZATION>, said the offer was rejected by union leaders as "totally unacceptable." 
The <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> wage settlement will be watched closely as a barometer of wage inflation in the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION>
Between Sept. 15 and Oct. 13, the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> says, the total number of <ORGANIZATION>Chemical Waste Management</ORGANIZATION> shares sold short leaped to 5.3 million from 1.9 million -- the largest increase for any stock on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>. 
"We love the company, we expect to be owners again, but we think for the moment it's at least adequately priced," says <PERSON>Gerald Levine</PERSON>, a partner at <ORGANIZATION>Weiss</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Peck & Greer</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Alliance Capital Management</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Equitable Life Assurance Society</ORGANIZATION>, has sold at least 927,000 shares this year.
<PERSON>Kenneth Hackel</PERSON>, a money manager who runs <ORGANIZATION>Cash Flow Investors</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Fort Lee</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, says <ORGANIZATION>Chemical Waste</ORGANIZATION> is "not my cup of tea." It sells for 38 times operating cash flow, he says, while the typical industrial company sells for only 7.7 times that yardstick. 
Shorting because of a high stock price alone is "a recipe for death," said <PERSON>Julian Robertson</PERSON> of Tiger Management in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Chemical Waste Management</ORGANIZATION> is "not our kind of short," said <PERSON>Joe Feshbach</PERSON>, one of the three brothers who run <ORGANIZATION>Feshbach Brothers</ORGANIZATION>, generally considered the nation's largest short-selling firm.
Analysts say hazardous-waste companies that have posted disappointing earnings include <ORGANIZATION>Canonie Environmental Services</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Systems</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Groundwater Technology</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Gundle Environmental Systems</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Rollins Environmental Services</ORGANIZATION>. 
But <ORGANIZATION>Chemical Waste</ORGANIZATION>'s earnings for the third quarter were "sparkling," says <PERSON>Kay Hahn</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
Also bullish is <PERSON>Remy Fisher</PERSON>, a vice president with <ORGANIZATION>J.W. Seligman & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> money-management firm that has been increasing its <ORGANIZATION>Chemical Waste</ORGANIZATION> shareholdings. "It doesn't seem like anything could tarnish {Chemical Waste's} growth prospects," she says.
Earnings for 1989 will be up about 30%, says <PERSON>Deborah Thielsch</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION>, compared with 34% growth in 1988.
<ORGANIZATION>Chemical Waste Management</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>NYSE</ORGANIZATION>; Symbol: CHW) 
<ORGANIZATION>A.H. Belo Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it asked the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Communications Commission</ORGANIZATION> to dismiss a request by the <ORGANIZATION>Dallas Times Herald</ORGANIZATION> calling for the <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION> to revoke <PERSON>Belo</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> television license. 
In a response to the commission, <PERSON>Belo</PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION>Dallas Morning News</ORGANIZATION>, WFAA-TV in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> and other TV stations, said that the <ORGANIZATION>Times Herald</ORGANIZATION>'s complaint is "without merit" and is an effort to gain leverage in a legal battle. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Dallas Times Herald</ORGANIZATION> filed the request with the <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION> earlier this month, charging that an agreement between <LOCATION>Belo</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Universal Press Syndicate</ORGANIZATION> is intended to eliminate newspaper competition in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Belo-Universal</ORGANIZATION> agreement calls for the two companies to study developing television programs based on <ORGANIZATION>Universal</ORGANIZATION>'s features.
As part of the agreement, <ORGANIZATION>Universal</ORGANIZATION> moved 26 features, including "Doonesbury," "The Far Side" and <PERSON>Dear Abby</PERSON>, to the Morning News from the <ORGANIZATION>Times Herald</ORGANIZATION>. 
A lawsuit filed by the <ORGANIZATION>Times Herald</ORGANIZATION> against <PERSON>Belo</PERSON> charging antitrust law violations and interference with a contract is pending in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> state court. 
<PERSON>Michael B. Jager</PERSON>, a construction industry consultant, was elected a director of this natural gas utility and its savings and loan subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION>PriMerit Bank</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION> asked a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> court to deny <ORGANIZATION>Warner Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's request for an injunction preventing <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> producers <PERSON>Peter Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Peters</PERSON> from taking over the management of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
The Japanese concern made its request in <LOCATION>Los Angeles Superior Court</LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> last week filed a $1 billion breach of contract suit against <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> are currently under contract to produce movies exclusively for <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>, which has agreed to pay $3.5 billion and to assume $1.5 billion in debt to buy <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>, is also offering $200 million for <ORGANIZATION>Guber Peters Entertainment Co.</ORGANIZATION>, of which the producers are co-chairmen and own a combined 28% stake. 
While executives from both sides say the matter still could be settled, papers filed in the court by <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> appear to heighten the acrimony of <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>'s most-watched legal battle.
<ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> claims an injunction would leave it "faced with the ominous possibility that it would complete a $5 billion entertainment company acquisition and be left with no management to run the company." <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> adds that "<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> must be grinning from ear to ear at the possibility of leaving <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> in such a position and at the opportunity to prevent the revitalization of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> into a strong competitor." 
<ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> disputes <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>'s contention that its offer to <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> violates their contract with <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>, which is in the process of being acquired by New York-based <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner Inc</ORGANIZATION>. Furthermore, <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> claims that the contract as written -- and oral agreements that <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> has denied exist -- allow the producers to take on such executive posts.
<ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>'s legal argument even raises the novel idea that <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> could actually make movies for <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> while serving in executive posts at another studio. 
<ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> acknowledges that <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>'s contract prevents the Guber-Peters team from being producers or executive producers of movies for another studio.
<ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> says <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> "could allow <PERSON>Guber</PERSON> and Peters to produce motion pictures for <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> as soon as the acquisition is consummated." 
But <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> also says in its filing that the <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> contract "doesn't require that <PERSON>Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peters</PERSON> take any affirmative steps to produce motion pictures; it simply rewards them when they do and prohibits them from producing for another entertainment company." And <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> says <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> has already shown it doesn't need the producers "by taking action to prevent <PERSON>Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peters</PERSON> from completing production in <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> properties." 
Among the arguments <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> makes is that <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> should let the producers go to <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> because it already allowed the producers to become co-chairmen of publicly held <ORGANIZATION>Barris Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which earlier this year changed its name to <ORGANIZATION>Guber Peters Entertainment</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> also says in its filing that <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> were offered management posts at <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> once before in 1987, and that "<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> approved and encouraged them to do so." 
<PERSON>Mr. Daly</PERSON> said that <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> had mentioned such an offer, and that he responded that "I thought the idea was a bad one from his point of view, and I understand he dropped the idea shortly thereafter." 
In a sworn declaration, <PERSON>Walter Yetnikoff</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>CBS Records</ORGANIZATION> unit, said <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Steven Ross</PERSON> has an "anti-Japanese, anti-Sony" bias.
But <PERSON>Stuart Rabinowitz</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>'s outside counsel, says <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> "violates American business morality by secretly raiding major producers under exclusive contract to <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>." 
In another sworn declaration yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> Vice Chairman <PERSON>Michael Schulof</PERSON> said that while he was negotiating with <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON>, he relied on the producers' assurances that <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> had previously agreed to let them terminate the contract and wouldn't have any trouble obtaining a release. 
<PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON>, meanwhile, in his own sworn declaration yesterday, maintained that running a studio has always been "our professed goal," and that <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> executives made an oral agreement that would free the producers from their contract should the opportunity arise.
<PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON>, in his declaration, supported <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON>'s claims and said he is "shocked" by the assertions of <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> executives that such an agreement was never made. 
<LOCATION>Bostik</LOCATION> is the first <ORGANIZATION>Emhart Corp.</ORGANIZATION> unit to be sold as part of the power-tool manufacturer's effort to reduce debt and consolidate operations after it acquired <ORGANIZATION>Emhart</ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. 
<ORGANIZATION>Black & Decker</ORGANIZATION> said it plans to put other <ORGANIZATION>Emhart</ORGANIZATION> units on the block in the future, with the goal of raising $1 billion in net proceeds. 
<ORGANIZATION>Black & Decker</ORGANIZATION> rescued <ORGANIZATION>Emhart</ORGANIZATION> from the takeover bid of <ORGANIZATION>Topper Limited Partnership</ORGANIZATION> last March by agreeing to acquire the maker of door locks and gardening tools for about $2.8 billion. 
Earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION>Black & Decker</ORGANIZATION> put three Emhart businesses on the auction block: the information and electronics segment, the Dynapert electrical assembly business and <ORGANIZATION>Mallory Capacitors</ORGANIZATION>.
"Our divestiture program is on schedule, and we remain confident that we will achieve our stated goal of over $1 billion in net proceeds," said <PERSON>Nolan D. Archibald</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Black & Decker</ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer, in a statement. 
The sales are an attempt to quell investor concern about <ORGANIZATION>Black & Decker</ORGANIZATION>'s increased debt burden from the <ORGANIZATION>Emhart</ORGANIZATION> purchase.
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Black & Decker</ORGANIZATION> closed at $19.75 yesterday, down 25 cents.
The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Intelligence Committee</ORGANIZATION> agreed on new rules for covert operations that will give President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> a freer hand to involve the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in coup plots in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> and elsewhere. 
Based on assurances from the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>, the committee agreed to rescind Reagan-era restrictions and give <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> operatives wide latitude to participate in planning foreign coups, according to committee officials. 
The agreement was disclosed last night after the panel approved separate intelligence legislation and held a closed hearing regarding <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> with officials from the <ORGANIZATION>Central Intelligence Agency</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION>. 
In return, <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> is sending <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> a letter pledging to notify the committee in advance of nearly all covert acts, but reserving the right to delay notification in some cases until a few days after the operations are launched, and in rare cases, to take longer. 
<ORGANIZATION>Balmy</ORGANIZATION> autumn days might be blissful for the average <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>, but not for the speculators on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION> who bought heating oil aggressively in September and October, betting on an early, harsh winter. 
As October draws to a close, weather is still generally warm in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, especially the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION> where much heating oil is consumed.
<LOCATION>West Texas</LOCATION> Intermediate, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> benchmark crude, fell 24 cents a barrel to close at $19.38 a barrel for December delivery.
Even reports of a <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> incident between former war foes <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> failed to shake crude's doldrums.
Shipping industry sources said two Iranian gunboats attacked an <LOCATION>Iraqi</LOCATION> tugboat near an <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> offshore oil terminal in the northern part of the gulf.
One broker said the markets might have been more bullish had a tanker been refused access to <LOCATION>Valdez</LOCATION>, the terminal port for the <LOCATION>Alaskan</LOCATION> pipeline and site last spring of the biggest oil spill in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> waters. 
GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: The prices of wheat futures contracts dipped amid reports of beneficial rain in the winter wheat growing regions of <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and forecasts for widespread rain this weekend in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in winter wheat states such as <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Victor Lespinasse</PERSON>, a floor broker for <ORGANIZATION>Dean Witter Reynolds</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>.
PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices jumped to life, bestirred by a highly volatile stock market and the resignation of a key figure in the Conservative government of <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON>.
Market analysts said that continued declines and volatility in the stock market contributed generally to enhanced investor interest in precious metals, but that the <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> political news was the main factor boosting prices: Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON>Nigel Lawson</PERSON> resigned.
Sir <PERSON>Alan Walters</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>'s economic adviser, also announced that he will resign.
With the metals markets closed in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> when the news was announced, a lot of <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> buying came to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Peter Cardillo</PERSON>, commodities trading adviser for <ORGANIZATION>Josephthal & Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Cardillo</PERSON> noted that the drop in the British pound following <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>'s resignation fueled the metals' rally as investors sought a safe haven.
<PERSON>William O'Neill</PERSON>, research director of <ORGANIZATION>Elders Futures Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said that if December gold can close above $375 for two consecutive days, he would regard that as a bullish sign.
However, he expected any strong rallies to be met by producer selling. "Both the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> must sell these rallies," he said.
<PERSON>Mr. O'Neill</PERSON> said the market was hit on Wednesday with the news that the atmosphere surrounding the negotiations on the strike at <LOCATION>Bougainville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Papua New Guinea</LOCATION>, may have improved.
<PERSON>Mr. Cardillo</PERSON> said that copper is reflecting a weakening <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economy and that he would be neither a buyer nor a seller at these levels. 
The decline was apparently sparked by rumors that the <LOCATION>Ivory Coast</LOCATION>, a major African producer, sold 20,000 tons in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> on Wednesday.
<PERSON>Bert Ruiz</PERSON>, soft commodity specialist at <LOCATION>Balfour</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Maclaine Futures Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said that all week he has seen increasing open interest and declining prices -- an almost certain sign that additional selling of contracts is taking place.
In a highly unusual move that buys time for <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to debate a debt-limit increase, the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury Department</ORGANIZATION> announced it will hold an unscheduled auction of securities next week to raise $17 billion. 
If <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> hasn't enacted a new debt limit by midnight Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> will have to suspend all sales of securities, including savings bonds. 
In a letter to congressional leaders, <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Nicholas Brady</PERSON> said the government will now be able to operate through Nov. 8 without a debt-limit increase. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>'s action comes in response to a continuing stalemate on <LOCATION>Capitol Hill</LOCATION> over the debt-limit legislation.
<ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> officials said they decided to take their extraordinary action to make certain that <ORGANIZATION>Social Security</ORGANIZATION> recipients get their checks.
They also said the administration may still seek to attach a capital-gains tax cut to the debt legislation despite the intensifying controversy. "The secretary believes capital gains is a top priority and that any available vehicle ought to be used," said <ORGANIZATION>Assistant Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Roger Bolton</PERSON>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>'s regular auction of <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bills, scheduled to settle on Thursday, is expected to be canceled.
In his letter to congressional leaders, <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Brady</PERSON> called the move an "extraordinary administrative action." He said that it "is important <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> act on debt-limit legislation no later than Nov. 7, in order to ensure adequate time to arrange market borrowings to avoid default." 
Increasing the limit is necessary to keep the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> from defaulting on its obligations, but the increase always creates intense controversy in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
Their hope is that <ORGANIZATION>Democratic</ORGANIZATION> leaders in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> wouldn't block it for fear of being blamed for the government's default. 
<ORGANIZATION>Compaq Computer Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's long-awaited entry today into the notebook field is expected to put immediate heat on others in the market, especially <ORGANIZATION>Zenith Electronics Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the current market leader, and on a swarm of promising start-ups. 
In recent months, <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION>'s competition, including <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Toshiba Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Tandy Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NEC Corp.</ORGANIZATION> all have introduced portables that weigh approximately the same and that are called notebooks -- perhaps misleadingly.
That can't be said of the $2,400 notepad computer introduced a few weeks ago by <ORGANIZATION>GRiD Systems Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <LOCATION>Tandy</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Atari Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <LOCATION>Portfolio</LOCATION>, introduced in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> two months ago and in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in early September, weighs less than a pound, costs a mere $400 and runs on three AA batteries, yet has the power to run some spreadsheets and word processing programs.
At stake is what <PERSON>Mike Swavely</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION>'s president of <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> operations, calls "the Holy Grail of the computer industry" -- the search for "a real computer in a package so small you can take it everywhere." The market is so new, nobody knows yet how big it can be. "I've had a lot of people trying to sell me services to find out how big it is," says <PERSON>Tom Humphries</PERSON>, director of marketing for GRiD. "Whether it's $5 billion or $3.5 billion, it doesn't matter.
Both palmtops are dismissed by notebook makers, who argue that they're too small -- a problem <ORGANIZATION>Poquet</ORGANIZATION> also encountered in focus groups, admits <PERSON>Gerry Purdy</PERSON>, director of marketing.
Toward that end, experts say the real battle will take place between center-stage players like <LOCATION>Toshiba</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> and now <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION>'s new machines are considered a direct threat to start-up firms like <ORGANIZATION>Dynabook Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which introduced in June a computer that, like <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION>'s, uses an <ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION> 286 microprocessor and has a hard disk drive.
<ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION>'s announcement also spells trouble for <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>, which last year had 28% of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> laptop market but recently agreed to sell its computer business to Cie. des <ORGANIZATION>Machines Bull</ORGANIZATION>, the French government-owned computer maker.
<ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> holders will vote in December on the proposed $635 million sale, a price that could slip because it is pegged to <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>'s share and sales. 
<ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION> is already taking aim at <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>'s market share.
<ORGANIZATION>Rod Canion</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer, notes pointedly that <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>'s $2,000 MinisPort uses an "unconventional" two-inch floppy disk, whereas <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION>'s new machines use the more common 3 1/2-inch disk.
<PERSON>John P. Frank</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Zenith Data Systems</ORGANIZATION>, simply shrugs off such criticism, noting that 3 1/2-inch floppies were also "unconventional" when they first replaced five-inch disks. "We don't look at it as not being a standard, we look at it as a new standard," he argues. 
Analysts don't see it that way. "I can't imagine that you'll talk to anyone who won't tell you this is dynamite for <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION> and a stopper for everyone else," says <PERSON>Gene Talsky</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Professional Marketing Management Inc</ORGANIZATION>. Adds <PERSON>Bill Lempesis</PERSON>, senior industry analyst for <ORGANIZATION>DataQuest</ORGANIZATION>, a high-technology market research firm: "We basically think that these are very hot products.
A third model, marketed in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, may hit the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> by the end of the first quarter of 1990, but by then, analysts say, <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION> will have established itself as one of three major players. 
Rated single-A-1 by <ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and single-A by <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor's Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the non-callable issue will be sold through underwriters led by <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ORGANIZATION>.

<ORGANIZATION>Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.</ORGANIZATION> -- $500 million of Remic mortgage securities offered in 13 classes by <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
Among classes for which details were available, yields ranged from 8.78%, or 75 basis points over two-year <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> securities, to 10.05%, or 200 basis points over 10-year <ORGANIZATION>Treasurys</ORGANIZATION>.

The principal-only securities will be repackaged by <ORGANIZATION>BT Securities</ORGANIZATION> into a <ORGANIZATION>Freddie Mac Remic</ORGANIZATION>, Series 103, that will have six classes.
<ORGANIZATION>Freddie Mac</ORGANIZATION> said the principal-only securities were priced at 58 1/4 to yield 8.45%, assuming an average life of eight years and a prepayment of 160% of the <ORGANIZATION>PSA</ORGANIZATION> model.

The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration, trying to blunt growing demands from <LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION> for a relaxation of controls on exports to the Soviet bloc, is questioning whether <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s Ing.
Most of the <ORGANIZATION>Western European</ORGANIZATION> members of <ORGANIZATION>Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls</ORGANIZATION>, the unofficial forum through which the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and its allies align their export-control policies, are expected to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting to be held in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> Oct. 25 and 26.
But the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration says it wants to see evidence that all <ORGANIZATION>Cocom</ORGANIZATION> members are complying fully with existing export-control procedures before it will support further liberalization.
To make its point, it is challenging the <LOCATION>Italian</LOCATION> government to explain reports that <PERSON>Olivetti</PERSON> may have supplied the Soviet Union with sophisticated computer-driven devices that could be used to build parts for combat aircraft. 
The <ORGANIZATION>London Sunday Times</ORGANIZATION>, which first reported the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> concerns, cited a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> intelligence report as the source of the allegations that <PERSON>Olivetti</PERSON> exported $25 million in "embargoed, state-of-the-art, flexible manufacturing systems to the Soviet aviation industry." <PERSON>Olivetti</PERSON> reportedly began shipping these tools in 1984. 
A <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman acknowledged that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is discussing the allegations with the Italian government and <ORGANIZATION>Cocom</ORGANIZATION>, but declined to confirm any details.
Italian President <PERSON>Francesco Cossiga</PERSON> promised a quick investigation into whether <PERSON>Olivetti</PERSON> broke <ORGANIZATION>Cocom</ORGANIZATION> rules.
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> called his attention to the matter during the <LOCATION>Italian</LOCATION> leader's visit here last week. 
<PERSON>Olivetti</PERSON> has denied that it violated <ORGANIZATION>Cocom</ORGANIZATION> rules, asserting that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the <LOCATION>Italian</LOCATION> authorities. 
Although the legality of these sales is still an open question, the disclosure couldn't be better timed to support the position of export-control hawks in the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> and the intelligence community. "It seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important <ORGANIZATION>Cocom</ORGANIZATION> meeting," said a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> lobbyist for a number of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> computer companies. 
Last summer, <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> moved the administration in the direction of gradual liberalization when he told a <ORGANIZATION>North Atlantic Treaty Organization</ORGANIZATION> meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the <ORGANIZATION>Cocom</ORGANIZATION> embargo of strategic goods.
But more recently, the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> openly feuded over the extent to which <ORGANIZATION>Cocom</ORGANIZATION> should liberalize exports of personal computers to the bloc. 
However, these agencies generally agree that the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> should be cautious about any further liberalization. "There's no evidence that the Soviet program to (illegally) acquire Western technology has diminished," said a <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman. 
Meanwhile, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> has negotiated a significant cut in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s steel quota, and made only a minor increase to the steel allotment for the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>. 
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, similar to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>, is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market than it had under the previous five-year steel quotas, which expired Sept. 30.
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> are the only two countries that haven't completed steel talks with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> for the year ending Oct. 1, 1990. 
Other countries that don't have formal steel quotas with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, such as <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, also have supplied steel.
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, which was one of the first countries to conclude its steel talks with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, virtually doubled its quota to 0.95% of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> steel market from 0.48% under the previous quotas.
The <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> -- the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>'s largest steel suppliers -- haven't been filling their quotas to the full extent.
The <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> steel industry, which has been coping with strong European demand, has been supplying about 5% of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market compared with recent quotas of about 6.7%.
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> has been shipping steel to total about 4.5% of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market compared with a quota of 5.9%. 
In the recent talks, the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> had its quota increased about 300,000 tons, to 7% of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market from 6.7% in 1988.
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> provide about 80% of the steel imported to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> under the quota program.
The balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters, such as <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>. 
Negotiators from the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> trade office will repeat these quota negotiations next year when they will have another 1% of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> steel market to allocate. 
A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Information International</ORGANIZATION> said the lawsuit by two units of <ORGANIZATION>Morris Communications Corp.</ORGANIZATION> seeks restitution of the system's about $3 million purchase price and cancellation of a software license provided by the <ORGANIZATION>Morris</ORGANIZATION> units to <ORGANIZATION>Information International</ORGANIZATION> for alleged failure to pay royalties. 
<ORGANIZATION>Information International</ORGANIZATION> said it believes that the complaints, filed in federal court in <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, are without merit.
Closely held <ORGANIZATION>Morris Communications</ORGANIZATION> is based in <LOCATION>Augusta</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga</LOCATION>.
The units that filed the suit are <ORGANIZATION>Southeastern Newspapers Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Florida Publishing Co</ORGANIZATION>.

The industry is "seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals," <PERSON>Glenn Cox</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Phillips Petroleum Co.</ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview. "That change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings" for the industry in general, he added.
So, too, many analysts predict, will <ORGANIZATION>Exxon Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Chevron Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Amoco Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
Third-quarter profits from gasoline were weaker. "Refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year," said <PERSON>William Randol</PERSON>, a securities analyst at <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
Demand has been much stronger than anticipated, and it typically accelerates in the fourth quarter. "We could see higher oil prices this year," said <PERSON>Bryan Jacoboski</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
"We've been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices," said <PERSON>Mr. Cox</PERSON>, <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON>'s president. "The lagging gas price is not going to assist fourth quarter performance as many had expected."

In an announcement to its staff last week, executives at <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's weekly magazine said <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION> will "dramatically de-emphasize" its use of electronic giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives; cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by 300,000, to four million; and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about $4 to $55. 
However, because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered, ad rates will be effectively 7.5% higher per subscriber, according to <PERSON>Richard Heinemann</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION> associate publisher. 
In recent years, <ORGANIZATION>Reader's Digest</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>New York Times Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <PERSON>McCall</PERSON>'s, and most recently <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's TV Guide, have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for advertisers. 
Besides, <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION> executives think selling a news magazine with a clock radio is tacky. "Giveaways just give people the wrong image," said <PERSON>Mr. Heinemann</PERSON>. "That perception takes the focus off the magazine." 
<ORGANIZATION>Time magazine</ORGANIZATION> executives predictably paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers. "What we are doing is screening out the readers who are only casually related to the magazine and don't really read it," said <PERSON>Mr. Heinemann</PERSON>. "We are trying to create quality and involvement." 
Still, <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION>'s move is being received well, once again. "It's terrific for advertisers to know the reader will be paying more," said <PERSON>Michael Drexler</PERSON>, national media director at <ORGANIZATION>Bozell Inc.</ORGANIZATION> ad agency. "A few drops in circulation are of no consequence.
<PERSON>Mr. Heinemann</PERSON> said the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry: a magazine's net revenue per subscriber, or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away. "The question is how much are we getting from each reader," said <PERSON>Mr. Heinemann</PERSON>. 
Time's rivals news-weeklies, <ORGANIZATION>Washington Post Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>U.S. News & World Report</ORGANIZATION>, are less reliant on electronic giveaways, and in recent years both have been increasing their circulation rate bases.
As the 1992 economic integration approaches, <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s cultural curators have taken to the ramparts against American "cultural imperialism," threatening to impose quotas against such pop invaders as "<LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>," "Miami Vice" and "L.A.
The most militant opposition to American TV imports has come from French television and movie producers, who have demanded quotas ensuring that a full 60% of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s TV shows be produced in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
One of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s favorite shows, "Fantastico," a tepid variety show, is so popular that viewers clamored to buy a chocolate product, "<PERSON>Cacao Fantastico</PERSON>," whose praises were sung each week by dancing showgirls -- even though the product didn't exist. 
Topping the cheese stunt, on another typical evening of fun on "<PERSON>Wetten Dass</PERSON>," a contestant won a bet with the show's host, <PERSON>Thomas Gottschalk</PERSON>, that he could identify 300 German dialects over the telephone.
A celebrity guest, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Ambassador to <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> <PERSON>Richard Burt</PERSON>, also won a bet that someone could pile up $150 worth of quarters on a slanted coin.
<PERSON>Mr. Burt</PERSON> nonetheless paid the penalty as if he had lost, agreeing to spend a day with West German Foreign Minister <PERSON>Hans-Dietrich Genscher</PERSON> frying and selling their combined weight in potato pancakes. 
Mega-hits in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> rarely make it even to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>, and almost never show up on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> screens. 
Another, "<PERSON>Jeux Sans Frontieres</PERSON>," where villagers from assorted European countries make fools of themselves performing pointless tasks, is a hit in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
The cream of the British crop, the literary dramas that are shown on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> public television as "Masterpiece Theater," make up a relatively small part of <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> air time.
A French knock-off of "<LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>," called "Chateauvallon" and set in a <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> vineyard, had a good run in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, which ended after the female lead was injured in a real-life auto accident. "Schwarzwaldklinik," (<ORGANIZATION>Black Forest Clinic</ORGANIZATION>), a kind of German "St.
Elsewhere" set in a health spa, is popular in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, and has spread into <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s most popular series is a drama called "La Piovra," or "The Octopus," which chronicles the fight of an idealistic young investigator in <LOCATION>Palermo</LOCATION> against the Mafia.
"The trend is pretty well established now that local programs are the most popular, with American programs second," says <PERSON>Brian Wenham</PERSON>, a former director of programs for the <ORGANIZATION>British Broadcasting Corp.</ORGANIZATION> "Given a choice, everybody will watch a home-produced show." 
Thus, <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> has begun the recent crusade to produce more worthy shows of its own, programs with broader appeal. "We've basically got to start from scratch, to train writers and producers to make shows that other people will want to see," concedes <PERSON>Colin Young</PERSON>, head of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Film Theatre School</ORGANIZATION>. 
Just last week, <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION> authorized two commercial channels for the first time; <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> earlier began to allow commercial television alongside its state channels.

Bids must be received by 1 p.m. EDT Thursday at the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> or at <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> banks or branches. 
<ORGANIZATION>Chase Manhattan Bank</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Willard Butcher</PERSON> is a conservative banker and a loyal Republican, but on Friday morning he had few kind words for President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s economic policy-making. 
The cuts are necessary because <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a deficit-cutting bill. "We simply don't have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices," <ORGANIZATION>House Budget Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Leon Panetta</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>) said yesterday on <ORGANIZATION>NBC News</ORGANIZATION>'s "Meet the Press." 
-- For the last two weeks, the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration and the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> have been engaged in a semi-public battle over international economic policy.
The administration has been trying to push the dollar lower; the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> has been resisting. "One of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary warfare between the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury Department</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Board</ORGANIZATION>," said <PERSON>Lawrence Kudlow</PERSON>, a Bear, <ORGANIZATION>Stearns & Co.</ORGANIZATION> economist, on <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s "This Week." 
Last month, Transportation Secretary <PERSON>Sam Skinner</PERSON> forced <ORGANIZATION>Northwest Airlines</ORGANIZATION> to reduce a stake held by <ORGANIZATION>KLM Royal Dutch Airlines</ORGANIZATION>.
But he has since run into opposition from the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> over that decision.
And he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, which includes a big stake by <ORGANIZATION>British Airways PLC</ORGANIZATION>.
Some analysts say uncertainty about <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION> takeover fell through -- the event that triggered the market drop. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> was locked in a battle over international economic policy, although at that time it was with West German officials rather than the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION>.
And concern about official actions aimed at takeovers -- then by the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION>House Ways and Means Committee</ORGANIZATION> rather than the <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION> -- were making markets nervous. 
The 1987 crash brought the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration and <ORGANIZATION>Democratic</ORGANIZATION> lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit, resulting in a two-year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $76 billion -- even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $12 billion during that period. 
But administration officials privately agree with <PERSON>Mr. Panetta</PERSON>, who said a precipitous drop this week "is going to force the president and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to take a much harder look at fiscal policy." 
In that case, there will be plenty of blame to go around. "There is an underlying concern on the part of the <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> people -- and there should be-that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut," said <ORGANIZATION>Senate Finance Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>). 
"There is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply didn't live up to this year's deal," <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON>George Mitchell</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>) said yesterday on <ORGANIZATION>CBS News</ORGANIZATION>'s "Face the Nation." 
At the very moment that <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation, <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON> told reporters that it was the president's policy to include it. 
When an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation, <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> <PERSON>Sen. Bob Packwood</PERSON>, the ranking <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> member of the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION>Senate Finance Committee</ORGANIZATION>, hailed it.
Friday's market tumble could spur action on reconciling the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> versions of the deficit-reduction measure, a process that isn't expected to begin until tomorrow at the soonest. 
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Republicans expressed the hope that the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> would follow the lead of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, which on Friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit. 
"The market needs a strong signal that we're serious about deficit reduction, and the best way to do that is for the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> to strip their bill" of similar provisions, <PERSON>Sen. Warren Rudman</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>N.H.</LOCATION>). said yesterday. 
The <ORGANIZATION>White House Office of Management and Budget</ORGANIZATION>, whose calculations determine whether the Gramm-Rudman targets are met, estimated that the House-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $6.2 billion, almost half of the <ORGANIZATION>Congressional Budget Office</ORGANIZATION>'s estimate of $11.0 billion.
Rep. <PERSON>Panetta</PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION>OMB</ORGANIZATION>'s figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts, but added: "We're getting very close to the margins here." 
Before the sun had set on Friday, <PERSON>Richard Rahn</PERSON>, the supply-side chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>, issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> decision to postpone action on capital gains. "Investors, who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell, were spooked," he said. 
Just last week they announced they may make a joint bid to buy <ORGANIZATION>Ferranti International Signal PLC</ORGANIZATION>, a smaller British defense contractor rocked by alleged accounting fraud at a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unit. 
The sudden romance of <ORGANIZATION>British Aerospace</ORGANIZATION> and Thomson-CSF -- traditionally bitter competitors for <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> and Third World weapons contracts -- is stirring controversy in <LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION>'s defense industry.
Most threatened by closer British Aerospace-Thomson ties would be their respective national rivals, including <ORGANIZATION>Matra S.A.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co</ORGANIZATION>. PLC.
But neither <ORGANIZATION>Matra</ORGANIZATION> nor <ORGANIZATION>GEC</ORGANIZATION> -- unrelated to <LOCATION>Stamford</LOCATION>, Conn.-based <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> -- are sitting quietly by as their competitors join forces. 
Yesterday, a source close to <ORGANIZATION>GEC</ORGANIZATION> confirmed that his company may join the <ORGANIZATION>Ferranti</ORGANIZATION> fight, as part of a possible consortium that would bid against <ORGANIZATION>British Aerospace</ORGANIZATION> and Thomson-CSF.
Companies with which <ORGANIZATION>GEC</ORGANIZATION> has had talks about a possible joint <ORGANIZATION>Ferranti</ORGANIZATION> bid include <ORGANIZATION>Matra</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Dowty Group PLC</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Daimler-Benz AG</ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Dassault</ORGANIZATION> group. 
<ORGANIZATION>GEC</ORGANIZATION> plans first to study <ORGANIZATION>Ferranti</ORGANIZATION>'s financial accounts, which auditors recently said included #215 million in fictitious contracts at a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unit, <ORGANIZATION>International Signal & Control Group</ORGANIZATION>, with which <ORGANIZATION>Ferranti</ORGANIZATION> merged last year.
Also, any <ORGANIZATION>GEC</ORGANIZATION> bid might be blocked by <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> antitrust regulators; <PERSON>Ferranti</PERSON> is <ORGANIZATION>GEC</ORGANIZATION>'s main competitor on several key defense-electronics contracts, and its purchase by <ORGANIZATION>GEC</ORGANIZATION> may heighten <ORGANIZATION>British Defense Ministry</ORGANIZATION> worries about concentration in the country's defense industry.
A consortium bid, however, would diminish <ORGANIZATION>GEC</ORGANIZATION>'s direct role in <LOCATION>Ferranti</LOCATION> and might consequently appease ministry officials. 
At least one potential <ORGANIZATION>GEC</ORGANIZATION> partner, <ORGANIZATION>Matra</ORGANIZATION>, insists it isn't interested in <LOCATION>Ferranti</LOCATION>. "We have nothing to say about this affair, which doesn't concern us," a <ORGANIZATION>Matra</ORGANIZATION> official said Sunday. 
For both <PERSON>Thomson</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>British Aerospace</ORGANIZATION>, earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight-fisted defense ministries; and <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> sales, a traditional mainstay for both companies' exports, have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices. 
The European defense industry is consolidating; for instance, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Siemens AG</ORGANIZATION> recently joined <ORGANIZATION>GEC</ORGANIZATION> in a takeover of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Plessey Co.</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Daimler-Benz</ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy <PERSON>Messerschmitt-Boelkow Blohm</PERSON> G.m.b.
In missiles, <PERSON>Thomson</PERSON> is already overshadowed by <ORGANIZATION>British Aerospace</ORGANIZATION> and by its home rival, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Aerospatiale S.A.</ORGANIZATION>; to better compete, <PERSON>Thomson</PERSON> officials say, they need a partnership.
Annual revenue of <ORGANIZATION>British Aerospace</ORGANIZATION>'s missile business is about #950 million, a <LOCATION>Thomson</LOCATION> spokesman said.
<PERSON>Thomson</PERSON> missile products, with about half <ORGANIZATION>British Aerospace</ORGANIZATION>'s annual revenue, include the Crotale surface-to-air missile family. 
Regarding the Oct. 3 letter to the editor from Rep. <PERSON>Tom Lantos</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>House Subcommittee on Employment and Housing</ORGANIZATION>, alleging: 
As your editorial rightly pointed out, <PERSON>Samuel Pierce</PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> secretary, and <PERSON>Lance Wilson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Pierce</PERSON>'s former aide, "are currently being held up to scorn for taking the Fifth Amendment." That certainly is not the supposed "distorted reading" indicated by <PERSON>Mr. Lantos</PERSON>. 
That the Journal defends "the sleaze, fraud, waste, embezzlement, influence-peddling and abuse of the public that took place while <PERSON>Mr. Pierce</PERSON> was secretary of <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION>," etc. and so forth. 
The problem, which the Journal so rightly pointed out in a number of articles, is not the likes of <PERSON>Mr. Lantos</PERSON>, who after all is really a bit player on the stage, but the attempt by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to enhance itself into a quasi-parliamentary/judicial body. (Of course, we've also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective.) The system is the problem, not an individual member.
But I think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> notions of liberty and freedom than any incompetency (and, yes, maybe criminality) within <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> could possibly generate.
I disagree with the statement by <PERSON>Mr. Lantos</PERSON> that one should not draw an adverse inference against former <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> officials who assert their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in congressional hearings. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> and some states have specifically recognized that "the �Fifth� Amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause." <PERSON>Baxter</PERSON> v.
<PERSON>Palmingiano</PERSON>, 425 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 308 (1976).
The subcommittee, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with <PERSON>Mr. Pierce</PERSON>'s own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime.

<PERSON>Alan Seelenfreund</PERSON>, 52 years old, was named chairman of this processor of prescription claims, succeeding <PERSON>Thomas W. Field Jr.</PERSON>, 55, who resigned last month.
<PERSON>Mr. Field</PERSON> also had been chairman of <ORGANIZATION>McKesson Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, resigning that post after a dispute with the board over corporate strategy.
<PERSON>Mr. Seelenfreund</PERSON> is executive vice president and chief financial officer of <ORGANIZATION>McKesson</ORGANIZATION> and will continue in those roles.
<ORGANIZATION>PCS</ORGANIZATION> also named <PERSON>Rex R. Malson</PERSON>, 57, executive vice president at <ORGANIZATION>McKesson</ORGANIZATION>, as a director, filling the seat vacated by <PERSON>Mr. Field</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Malson</PERSON> and Seelenfreund are directors of <ORGANIZATION>McKesson</ORGANIZATION>, which has an 86% stake in <ORGANIZATION>PCS</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>David L. Paul</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, criticized the federal <ORGANIZATION>Office of Thrift Supervision</ORGANIZATION>, which issued the directive, saying it was "inappropriate" and based on "insufficient" reasons.
<PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> said only about $150 million of the current holdings are tradeable securities registered with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Office of Thrift Supervision</ORGANIZATION> has been hounding CenTrust to provide current market values for its holdings, but <ORGANIZATION>CenTrust</ORGANIZATION> has said it can't easily obtain such values because of the relative illiquidity of the bonds and lack of a ready market. 
In <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading Friday, <ORGANIZATION>CenTrust</ORGANIZATION> common shares closed at $3, down 12.5 cents. 
<PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> said the regulators should instead move ahead with approving <ORGANIZATION>CenTrust</ORGANIZATION>'s request to sell 63 of its 71 branches to <ORGANIZATION>Great Western Bank</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Great Western Financial Corp.</ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. 
The branch sale is the centerpiece of <ORGANIZATION>CenTrust</ORGANIZATION>'s strategy to transform itself into a traditional S&L from a high-flying institution that relied heavily on securities trading for profits, according to <PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON>.
BULL <ORGANIZATION>HN INFORMATION SYSTEMS Inc.</ORGANIZATION> is a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> majority-owned unit of Cie. des <ORGANIZATION>Machines Bull</ORGANIZATION>.
Separately, the company said it would file a delayed fiscal-year report with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> "within approximately 45 days." It said the delay resulted from difficulties in resolving its accounting of a settlement with the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Trade Commission</ORGANIZATION>.

Friday's fall marks the start of a bear market, says <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Ned Davis Research Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
I don't think that's the case at all," says <PERSON>Mr. Cooperman</PERSON>, a partner at <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs Asset Management</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>John Kenneth Galbraith</PERSON>. "This is the latest manifestation of the capacity of the financial community for recurrent insanity," says <PERSON>Mr. Galbraith</PERSON>, an economist. 
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> money manager <PERSON>Mario Gabelli</PERSON>, an expert at spotting takeover candidates, says that takeovers aren't totally gone. 
Examples are "<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> looking at <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth</ORGANIZATION> looking at <ORGANIZATION>LIN Broadcasting</ORGANIZATION>." These sorts of takeovers don't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them, so <PERSON>Mr. Gabelli</PERSON> figures they will continue. 
"The market was up 35% since {President} <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> took office," <PERSON>Mr. Gabelli</PERSON> says, so a correction was to be expected.
<PERSON>Jim Rogers</PERSON>. "It seems to me that this is the pin that has finally pricked the balloon," says <PERSON>Mr. Rogers</PERSON>, a professor of finance at <ORGANIZATION>Columbia University</ORGANIZATION> and former co-manager of one of the most successful hedge funds in history, Quantum Fund. 
Dealers "would give you a quote, but then refuse to make the trade." If the dollar stays weak, he says, that will add to inflationary pressures in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and make it hard for the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Board</ORGANIZATION> to ease interest rates very much. 
<PERSON>Mr. Rogers</PERSON> won't decide what to do today until he sees how the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> markets go.
<PERSON>Mr. Curzio</PERSON> says what happens now will depend a good deal on the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Board</ORGANIZATION>.
Stock prices "would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks," says <PERSON>Mr. Terrizzi</PERSON>, president and managing director of <ORGANIZATION>Renaissance Investment Management Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION>. 
Renaissance is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents, primarily <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bills. "T-bills probably are the right place to be," he says. 
<ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Nicholas Brady</PERSON> said in a statement Friday that the stock-market decline "doesn't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy." 
<ORGANIZATION>Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association</ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> withdrew from regulators its application to buy five <ORGANIZATION>Valley Federal</ORGANIZATION> branches, leaving the transaction in limbo. 
The broken purchase appears as additional evidence of trouble at <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, whose spokesman said the company withdrew its application from the federal <ORGANIZATION>Office of Thrift Supervision</ORGANIZATION> because of an informal notice that <ORGANIZATION>Imperial</ORGANIZATION>'s thrift unit failed to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements. 
The transaction, announced in August, included about $146 million in deposits at the five outlets in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>San Joaquin Valley</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Valley Federal</ORGANIZATION> said Friday that it is considering whether to seek another buyer for the branches or to pursue the transaction with <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which said it is attempting to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements. 
<ORGANIZATION>Valley Federal</ORGANIZATION>, with assets of $3.3 billion, is based in <LOCATION>Van Nuys</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Imperial Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, is the parent of <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Savings & Loan</ORGANIZATION>.
Interprovincial, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s biggest oil pipeline operator and a major transporter of crude to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, said revised industry forecasts indicate that <LOCATION>Canadian</LOCATION> oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991, 8% lower than a previous estimate.
"The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping," and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically, as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas, said <PERSON>Ronald Watkins</PERSON>, vice president for government and industry relations with <ORGANIZATION>Interprovincial</ORGANIZATION>'s parent, <ORGANIZATION>Interhome Energy Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Watkins</PERSON> said volume on Interprovincial's system is down about 2% since January and is expected to fall further, making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s. 
The number of active drilling rigs in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> is down 30% from a year ago, and the number of completed oil wells is "down more than that, due to the increasing focus on gas exploration," said <PERSON>Robert Feick</PERSON>, manager of crude oil with <ORGANIZATION>Calgary</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Independent Petroleum Association of Canada</ORGANIZATION>, an industry group. 
<PERSON>Mr. Watkins</PERSON> said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature, conventional fields in western <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>.
Interprovincial transports about 75% of all crude produced in western <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, and almost 60% of <ORGANIZATION>Interprovincial</ORGANIZATION>'s total volume consists of light crude. 
Nearly all of the crude oil that <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> exports to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is transported on <ORGANIZATION>Interprovincial</ORGANIZATION>'s system, whose main line runs from <LOCATION>Edmonton</LOCATION> to major <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Canadian cities in the <LOCATION>Great Lakes</LOCATION> region, including <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Buffalo</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s current oil exports to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> total about 600,000 barrels a day, or about 9.1% of net <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> crude imports, said <PERSON>John Lichtblau</PERSON>, president of the New York-based <ORGANIZATION>Petroleum Industry Research Foundation</ORGANIZATION>.
That ranks <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> as the fourth-largest source of imported crude, behind <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nigeria</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Lichtblau</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s declining crude output, combined with the fast-shrinking output of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> crude, will help intensify <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> reliance on oil from overseas, particularly the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION>. "It's very much a growing concern.
<PERSON>Mr. Lichtblau</PERSON> stressed that the delay of <ORGANIZATION>Interprovincial</ORGANIZATION>'s proposed expansion won't by itself increase <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dependence on offshore crude, however, since Canadian imports are limited in any case by <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s falling output. 
<ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers International Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, announced it will issue warrants on shares of <ORGANIZATION>Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 
The move closely follows a similar offer by <ORGANIZATION>Salomon</ORGANIZATION> of warrants for shares of <ORGANIZATION>Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
Under the latest offer, HK$62.5 million (US$8 million) of three-year warrants will be issued in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, each giving buyers the right to buy one <ORGANIZATION>Hong Kong Telecommunications</ORGANIZATION> share at a price to be determined Friday. 
In trading on the <ORGANIZATION>Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>, the shares closed Wednesday at HK$4.80 each.
While <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> companies have in the past issued warrants on their own shares, <ORGANIZATION>Salomon</ORGANIZATION>'s warrants are the first here to be issued by a third party.
The <ORGANIZATION>Hong Kong Telecommunications</ORGANIZATION> warrants should be attractive to buyers in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, the bankers added, because the group is one of a handful of blue-chip stocks on the <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> market that has international appeal. 
The lower results, <PERSON>Mr. Pierce</PERSON> said, reflect a 12-month decline in industry sales of privately owned pay telephones, <ORGANIZATION>Elcotel</ORGANIZATION>'s primary business.
Although <PERSON>Mr. Pierce</PERSON> expects that line of business to strengthen in the next year, he said <ORGANIZATION>Elcotel</ORGANIZATION> will also benefit from moving into other areas. 
Within the next year, <ORGANIZATION>Elcotel</ORGANIZATION> expects to place 10,000 fax machines, made by <LOCATION>Minolta</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, in hotels, municipal buildings, drugstores and other public settings around the country.
<PERSON>Mr. Pierce</PERSON> said <PERSON>Elcotel</PERSON> should realize a minimum of $10 of recurring net earnings for each machine each month. 
Automatic call processors will provide that system for virtually any telephone, <PERSON>Mr. Pierce</PERSON> said, not just phones produced by <PERSON>Elcotel</PERSON>. 
A consortium of private investors operating as <ORGANIZATION>LJH Funding Co.</ORGANIZATION> said it has made a $409 million cash bid for most of <ORGANIZATION>L.J. Hooker Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's real-estate and shopping-center holdings. 
The group is led by <PERSON>Jay Shidler</PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Shidler Investment Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>A. Boyd Simpson</PERSON>, chief executive of the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION>Simpson Organization Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Shidler</PERSON>'s company specializes in commercial real-estate investment and claims to have $1 billion in assets; <PERSON>Mr. Simpson</PERSON> is a developer and a former senior executive of <ORGANIZATION>L.J. Hooker</ORGANIZATION>. 
"The assets are good, but they require more money and management" than can be provided in <PERSON>L.J. Hooker</PERSON>'s current situation, said <PERSON>Mr. Simpson</PERSON> in an interview. "Hooker's philosophy was to build and sell.
<ORGANIZATION>L.J. Hooker</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, is operating with protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Bankruptcy Code.
Its parent company, <ORGANIZATION>Hooker Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, is currently being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator.
<PERSON>Sanford Sigoloff</PERSON>, chief executive of <PERSON>L.J. Hooker</PERSON>, said yesterday in a statement that he has not yet seen the bid but that he would review it and bring it to the attention of the creditors committee. 
The $409 million bid is estimated by <PERSON>Mr. Simpson</PERSON> as representing 75% of the value of all Hooker real-estate holdings in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
Not included in the bid are <ORGANIZATION>Bonwit Teller</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>B. Altman & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>L.J. Hooker</PERSON>'s department-store chains. 
The offer covers the massive 1.8 million-square-foot Forest Fair Mall in <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION>, the 800,000 square-foot <ORGANIZATION>Richland Fashion Mall</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Columbia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, and the 700,000 square-foot Thornton Town Center mall in <LOCATION>Thornton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo</LOCATION>.
The <PERSON>Thornton</PERSON> mall opened Sept. 19 with a <ORGANIZATION>Bigg</ORGANIZATION>'s hypermarket as its anchor; the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> mall is expected to open Nov. 15. 
Other Hooker properties included are a 20-story office tower in <LOCATION>midtown Atlanta</LOCATION>, expected to be completed next February; vacant land sites in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION>L.J. Hooker International</ORGANIZATION>, the commercial real-estate brokerage company that once did business as <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch Commercial Real Estate</ORGANIZATION>, plus other shopping centers. 
The consortium was put together by <PERSON>Hoare Govett</PERSON>, the London-based investment banking company that is a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Security Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> "We don't anticipate any problems in raising the funding for the bid," said <PERSON>Allan Campbell</PERSON>, the head of mergers and acquisitions at <PERSON>Hoare Govett</PERSON>, in an interview.
According to people familiar with the consortium, the bid was code-named <ORGANIZATION>Project Klute</ORGANIZATION>, a reference to the film "Klute" in which a prostitute played by actress <PERSON>Jane Fonda</PERSON> is saved from a psychotic businessman by a police officer named <PERSON>John Klute</PERSON>. 
<ORGANIZATION>L.J. Hooker</ORGANIZATION> was a small home-building company based in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> in 1979 when <PERSON>Mr. Simpson</PERSON> was hired to push it into commercial development.
The company grew modestly until 1986, when a majority position in <ORGANIZATION>Hooker Corp.</ORGANIZATION> was acquired by Australian developer <PERSON>George Herscu</PERSON>, currently <PERSON>Hooker</PERSON>'s chairman. 
<PERSON>Mr. Herscu</PERSON> proceeded to launch an ambitious, but ill-fated, $1 billion acquisition binge that included <ORGANIZATION>Bonwit Teller</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>B. Altman & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, as well as majority positions in <ORGANIZATION>Merksamer Jewelers</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> chain; <ORGANIZATION>Sakowitz Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the Houston-based retailer, and <ORGANIZATION>Parisian Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>Southeast</LOCATION> department-store chain. 
Eventually <PERSON>Mr. Simpson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Herscu</PERSON> had a falling out over the direction of the company, and <PERSON>Mr. Simpson</PERSON> said he resigned in 1988.
Since then, <ORGANIZATION>Hooker Corp.</ORGANIZATION> has sold its interest in the <LOCATION>Parisian</LOCATION> chain back to <LOCATION>Parisian</LOCATION>'s management and is currently attempting to sell the <ORGANIZATION>B. Altman & Co.</ORGANIZATION> chain.
In addition, <PERSON>Robert Sakowitz</PERSON>, chief executive of the <ORGANIZATION>Sakowitz</ORGANIZATION> chain, is seeking funds to buy out the Hooker interest in his company.
The <ORGANIZATION>Merksamer</ORGANIZATION> chain is currently being offered for sale by <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
Reached in <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Shidler</PERSON> said that he believes the various Hooker malls can become profitable with new management. "These aren't mature assets, but they have the potential to be so," said <PERSON>Mr. Shidler</PERSON>. "Managed properly, and with a long-term outlook, these can become investment-grade quality properties." 
<PERSON>Hugo Quackenbush</PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Charles Schwab Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the San Francisco-based discount brokerage firm, said he didn't expect any immediate problems with margin calls for <PERSON>Schwab</PERSON> customers.
<ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> will continue to program action-adventure shows to follow the <LOCATION>Sajak</LOCATION> hour.
The show, despite a promising start, has slipped badly in the weekly ratings as compiled by <ORGANIZATION>A.C. Nielsen Co.</ORGANIZATION>, finishing far below "Tonight" on <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION>, and "Nightline" on <ORGANIZATION>ABC-TV</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Capital Cities/ABC Inc</ORGANIZATION>. Further fractioning the late-night audience is the addition of the "Arsenio Hall Show," syndicated by <ORGANIZATION>Paramount Communications Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
And among the issues hitting new highs were <ORGANIZATION>Detroit Edison Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Niagara Mohawk Power Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Other major issues hitting highs included <ORGANIZATION>American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Westinghouse Electric Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Exxon Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Cigna Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the big insurer. 
Other new lows included <ORGANIZATION>Navistar International Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Union Carbide Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Bethlehem Steel Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, all of which are included in the industrial average. 
Shares of <ORGANIZATION>Rally's Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, an operator of fast-food restaurants, closed at $17 each, up from its $15 offering price and shares of <ORGANIZATION>Employee Benefit Plans Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a health-care consultant, closed at $14.125, up from its $12 offering price. 
A group of <ORGANIZATION>Arby</ORGANIZATION>'s franchisees said they formed an association to oppose <LOCATION>Miami Beach</LOCATION> financier <PERSON>Victor Posner</PERSON>'s control of the restaurant chain. 
At the time, a group called <ORGANIZATION>R.B. Partners Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, consisting of eight of <ORGANIZATION>Arby</ORGANIZATION>'s largest franchisees, offered more than $200 million to buy <ORGANIZATION>Arby's Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which is part of <ORGANIZATION>DWG Corp</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>DWG</ORGANIZATION> is a holding company controlled by <PERSON>Mr. Posner</PERSON>.
One week later, <PERSON>Leonard H. Roberts</PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Arby's</ORGANIZATION>, was fired in a dispute with <PERSON>Mr. Posner</PERSON>. 
Friday, 42 franchisees announced the formation of an association -- called <ORGANIZATION>A.P. Association Inc.</ORGANIZATION> -- to "preserve the integrity of the Arby's system." The franchisees, owners or operators of 1,000 of the 1,900 franchised Arby's in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, said: "We have concluded that continued control of <ORGANIZATION>Arby</ORGANIZATION>'s by <PERSON>Victor Posner</PERSON> is totally unacceptable to us, because it is extremely likely to cause irreparable damage to the Arby's system.
We support all efforts to remove <PERSON>Victor Posner</PERSON> from control of <ORGANIZATION>Arby's Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and the Arby's system." 
In <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Renee Mottram</PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION>DWG</ORGANIZATION>, responded: "We don't think any individual or group should disrupt a winning system or illegally interfere with existing contractual relationships for their own self-serving motives." 
The company said <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, underwriters for the offering, were granted an option to buy as much as an additional 1.5 million shares to cover over-allotments.
When the news broke of an attempted coup in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> two weeks ago, <PERSON>Sen. Christopher Dodd</PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> for a briefing. "They said, `follow <ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION>,'" he told reporters. 
That shows how far <PERSON>Ted Turner</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Cable News Network</ORGANIZATION> has come since its birth nine years ago, when it was considered the laughingstock of television news.
"Just the fact we're on 24 hours is no longer bulletin," says <PERSON>Ed Turner</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president, news gathering (and no relation to <LOCATION>Ted Turner</LOCATION>). "You can't live on that." 
So <ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION>Turner Broadcasting System Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, is trying to reposition itself as a primary channel, or what people in the television industry call a "top of mind" network.
The show will be co-anchored by <PERSON>Bernard Shaw</PERSON> and <PERSON>Catherine Crier</PERSON>, a 34-year-old former <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> judge and campus beauty queen who has never held a job in television or journalism. 
"The next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables," says <PERSON>Jon Petrovich</PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Headline News</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION>'s sister network. 
Already, <ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION> is facing stronger competition from <ORGANIZATION>Financial News Network Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Consumer News</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Business Channel</ORGANIZATION>, both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future.
Now, the push is on for more-distinctive shows. "Our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity," says <PERSON>Paul Amos</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION> executive vice president for programming. 
Accordingly, <ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION> is adding a world-affairs show in the morning because surveys show its global-news hour in the afternoon is among its most "differentiated" programs in viewers' minds, says <PERSON>Mr. Amos</PERSON>.
Then there's "The World Today," the prime-time newscast featuring <PERSON>Mr. Shaw</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ms. Crier</PERSON>.
Until now, <ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION> has featured its <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> gossip show during the key evening period.
<PERSON>Mr. Amos</PERSON> says the Shaw-Crier team will probably do two live interviews a day, with most of the program, at least for now, appearing similar to <ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION>'s other newcasts. 
Some in the industry are skeptical. "I find it hard to conceive of people switching over to <ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION> for what, at least in the public's mind, is the same news," says <PERSON>Reuven Frank</PERSON>, the former two-time president of <ORGANIZATION>NBC News</ORGANIZATION> and creator of the Huntley-Brinkley Report. 
In August, the network hired award-winning producer <PERSON>Pamela Hill</PERSON>, the former head of news specials at <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION> executives hope the headlines created by such scoops will generate excitement for its "branded" programs, in the way "60 Minutes" did so well for <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>. 
That's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical <ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION> will follow through with its investigative commitment, especially after it sees the cost of producing in-depth pieces. "They've never shown any inclination to spend money on production," says <PERSON>Michael Mosettig</PERSON>, a senior producer with <PERSON>MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour</PERSON>, who notes that <ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION> is indispensable to his job. 
Says <PERSON>Mr. Mosettig</PERSON>: "<ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION> is my wire service; they're on top of everything.
They market cable-TV on the very grazing opportunities <ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION> seeks to discourage. "We would obviously be upset if those kinds of services evolved into more general-interest, long-format programming," says <PERSON>Robert Stengel</PERSON>, senior vice president, programming, of <ORGANIZATION>Continental Cablevision Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which holds a 2% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Turner Broadcasting</ORGANIZATION>. 
With economic tension between the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> worsening, many Japanese had feared last week's visit from <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON>Carla Hills</PERSON>.
They expected a new barrage of demands that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
Instead, they got a discussion of the need for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to work together and of the importance of the long-term view.
<PERSON>Mrs. Hills</PERSON>' first trip to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> as <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month's visit by <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Robert A. Mosbacher</PERSON>. 
He said such results should be "measurable in dollars and cents" in reducing the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade deficit with <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
But <PERSON>Mrs. Hills</PERSON>, speaking at a breakfast meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>American Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> on Saturday, stressed that the objective "is not to get definitive action by spring or summer, it is rather to have a blueprint for action." She added that she expected "perhaps to have a down payment . . . some small step to convince the American people and the Japanese people that we're moving in earnest." 
American and Japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen <PERSON>Mr. Mosbacher</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mrs. Hills</PERSON>.
And some said it reflected the growing debate in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> over pursuing free trade with <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> versus some kind of managed trade. 
Asked to compare her visit to <PERSON>Mr. Mosbacher</PERSON>'s, <PERSON>Mrs. Hills</PERSON> replied: "I didn't hear every word he spoke, but as a general proposition, I think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration." Yet more than one <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> official who sat in with her during three days of talks with Japanese officials said her tone often was surprisingly "conciliatory." 
<PERSON>Mrs. Hills</PERSON>' remarks did raise questions, at least among some <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials, about what exactly her stance is on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> access to the Japanese semiconductor market.
<ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service</ORGANIZATION> said it reduced its rating on $165 million of subordinated debt of this <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, thrift, citing turmoil in the market for low-grade, high-yield securities.
FRANKLIN SAVINGS ASSOCIATION (<LOCATION>Ottawa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kan.</LOCATION>) -- <ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it downgraded its rating to B-2 from Ba-3 on less than $20 million of this thrift's senior subordinated notes.
The rating concern said <LOCATION>Franklin</LOCATION>'s "troubled diversification record in the securities business" was one reason for the downgrade, citing the troubles at its <ORGANIZATION>L.F. Rothschild</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary and the possible sale of other subsidiaries. "They perhaps had concern that we were getting out of all these," said <LOCATION>Franklin</LOCATION> President <PERSON>Duane H. Hall</PERSON>. "I think it was a little premature on their part." 
The West German retailer <ORGANIZATION>ASKO Deutsche Kaufhaus AG</ORGANIZATION> plans to challenge the legality of a widely employed anti-takeover defense of companies in the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>. 
Should the courts uphold the validity of this type of defense, <ORGANIZATION>ASKO</ORGANIZATION> will then ask the court to overturn such a vote-diluting maneuver recently deployed by <ORGANIZATION>Koninklijke Ahold NV</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>ASKO</ORGANIZATION> says the Dutch-based international food retailer hadn't reasonable grounds to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust and thus dilute the worth and voting power of <ORGANIZATION>ASKO</ORGANIZATION> and other shareholders. 
Speaking through its Dutch lawyers, <ORGANIZATION>ASKO</ORGANIZATION> also disclosed it holds a 15% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Ahold</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Diamond Shamrock Offshore Partners</ORGANIZATION> said it had discovered gas offshore <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Diamond Shamrock Offshore</ORGANIZATION>'s stock rose 12.5 cents Friday to close at $8.25 in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading. 
The following <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>, corporate and municipal offerings are tentatively scheduled for sale this week, according to Dow Jones Capital Markets Report: 
<ORGANIZATION>B&H Crude Carriers Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> -- Four million common shares, via <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc</ORGANIZATION>.

The results, which are in line with analysts' estimates, reflect "a continued improvement in our <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> business," said <PERSON>James Treybig</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Tandem</ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer. 
Analysts have predicted that the <LOCATION>Cupertino</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, company will report revenue of $430 million to $460 million and earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a share. 
Commenting on the results for the quarter, <PERSON>Mr. Treybig</PERSON> said the strength of the company's domestic business came as "a surprise" to him, noting that sales "in every region of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> exceeded our plan." 
"We believe they could siphon perhaps two to three billion dollars from <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>" over the next few years, said <PERSON>George Weiss</PERSON>, an analyst at the Gartner group.
That will spur <ORGANIZATION>Tandem</ORGANIZATION>'s growth. "I'd be disappointed if the company grew by less than 20% next year," said <PERSON>John Levinson</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> is expected to respond to <ORGANIZATION>Tandem</ORGANIZATION>'s Cyclone by discounting its own mainframes, which analysts say are roughly three times the price of a comparable system from <ORGANIZATION>Tandem</ORGANIZATION>. "Obviously <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> can give bigger discounts to users immediately," said <PERSON>Mr. Weiss</PERSON>. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Treybig</PERSON> questions whether that will be enough to stop <ORGANIZATION>Tandem</ORGANIZATION>'s first mainframe from taking on some of the functions that large organizations previously sought from Big Blue's machines. "The answer isn't price reductions, but new systems," he said. 
Nevertheless, <ORGANIZATION>Tandem</ORGANIZATION> faces a variety of challenges, the biggest being that customers generally view the company's computers as complementary to <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>'s mainframes.
Even <PERSON>Mr. Treybig</PERSON> is reluctant to abandon this notion, insisting that <ORGANIZATION>Tandem</ORGANIZATION>'s new machines aren't replacements for <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>'s mainframes. 
In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Bonwit Teller</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>B. Altman & Co.</ORGANIZATION> department stores have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, while the <ORGANIZATION>R.H. Macy & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale</ORGANIZATION>'s and <ORGANIZATION>Saks Fifth Avenue</ORGANIZATION> department-store chains are for sale. 
"Improved paper prices will help offset weakness in linage, but the retailers' problems have affected the amount of ad linage they usually run," said <PERSON>Edward J. Atorino</PERSON>, industry analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "Retailers are just in disarray." 
For instance, <ORGANIZATION>Gannett Co.</ORGANIZATION> posted an 11% gain in net income, as total ad pages dropped at <ORGANIZATION>USA Today</ORGANIZATION>, but advertising revenue rose because of a higher circulation rate base and increased rates.
Total advertising linage was "modestly" lower as classified-ad volume increased, while there was "softer demand" for retail and national ad linage, said <PERSON>John Curley</PERSON>, <PERSON>Gannett</PERSON>'s chief executive officer. 
<PERSON>William O. Taylor</PERSON>, the parent's chairman and chief executive officer, said earnings continued to be hurt by softness in ad volume at the <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> newspaper. 
<PERSON>Mr. Atorino</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers</ORGANIZATION> said he estimates that <ORGANIZATION>Times Mirror Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's earnings were down for the third quarter, because of soft advertising levels at its <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION> Newsday and <ORGANIZATION>Hartford Courant</ORGANIZATION> newspapers.
Trouble on the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> was likely offset by improved ad linage at the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Times</ORGANIZATION>, which this week also unveiled a redesign. 
<ORGANIZATION>New York Times Co.</ORGANIZATION> is expected to report lower earnings for the third quarter because of continued weak advertising levels at its flagship <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> and deep discounting of newsprint at its affiliate, <ORGANIZATION>Forest Products Group</ORGANIZATION>. 
"<ORGANIZATION>Times Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's regional daily newspapers are holding up well, but there is little sign that things will improve in the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> market," said <PERSON>Alan Kassan</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Washington Post Co.</ORGANIZATION> is expected to report improved earnings, largely because of increased cable revenue and publishing revenue helped by an improved retail market in the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> area.
<ORGANIZATION>Knight-Ridder Inc.</ORGANIZATION> is faced with continued uncertainty over the pending joint operating agreement between its <ORGANIZATION>Detroit Free Press</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Gannett</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Detroit News</ORGANIZATION>, and has told analysts that earnings were down in the third quarter.
However, analysts point to positive advertising spending at several of its major daily newspapers, such as the <LOCATION>Miami Herald</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>San Jose Mercury News</ORGANIZATION>. 
"The <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> market is coming back strong after a tough couple of years" when <PERSON>Knight-Ridder</PERSON> "was starting up a Hispanic edition and circulation was falling," said <PERSON>Bruce Thorp</PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Provident National Bank</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Institut Merieux S.A.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> said the <LOCATION>Canadian</LOCATION> government raised an obstacle to its proposed acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Connaught BioSciences Inc.</ORGANIZATION> for 942 million Canadian dollars (US$801.6 million). 
<PERSON>Merieux</PERSON> said the government's minister of industry, science and technology told it that he wasn't convinced that the purchase is likely to be of "net benefit" to <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Alan Nymark</PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Investment Canada</ORGANIZATION>, which oversees foreign takeovers, said it marked the first time in its four-year history that the agency has made an adverse net-benefit decision about the acquisition of a publicly traded company.
"This isn't a change in government policy; this provision has been used before," said <PERSON>Jodi Redmond</PERSON>, press secretary for <PERSON>Harvie Andre</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s minister of industry, science and technology.
<PERSON>Mr. Andre</PERSON> issued the ruling based on a recommendation by <ORGANIZATION>Investment Canada</ORGANIZATION>. 
Spokesmen for <ORGANIZATION>Merieux</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Connaught</ORGANIZATION> said they hadn't been informed of specific areas of concern by either the government or <ORGANIZATION>Investment Canada</ORGANIZATION>, but added they hope to have more information early this week. 
<PERSON>Viren Mehta</PERSON>, a partner with <ORGANIZATION>Mehta & Isaly</ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based pharmaceutical industry research firm, said the government's ruling wasn't unexpected. 
"This has become a very politicized deal, concerning <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s only large, world-class bio-research or pharmaceutical company," <PERSON>Mr. Mehta</PERSON> said. 
<PERSON>Mr. Mehta</PERSON> said the move that could allow the transaction to go ahead as planned could be an out-of-court settlement of Connaught's dispute with the <ORGANIZATION>University of Toronto</ORGANIZATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is seeking to block the acquisition of Connaught by foreign interests, citing concerns about the amount of research that would be done in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. 
While neither side will disclose its contents, <PERSON>Mr. Mehta</PERSON> expects it to contain more specific guarantees on research and development spending levels in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> than <ORGANIZATION>Merieux</ORGANIZATION> offered to <ORGANIZATION>Investment Canada</ORGANIZATION>. 
Some analysts, such as <PERSON>Murray Grossner</PERSON> of Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION>Richardson Greenshields Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, believe the government ruling leaves the door open for other bidders, such as <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>'s Ciba-Geigy and <ORGANIZATION>Chiron Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Emeryville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
French state-owned <ORGANIZATION>Rhone-Poulenc S.A.</ORGANIZATION> holds 51% of <ORGANIZATION>Merieux</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Financial Corp.</ORGANIZATION> purchased the bonds, the suit alleged, after <PERSON>Mr. Boesky</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> negotiated an agreement for <ORGANIZATION>Vagabond Hotels</ORGANIZATION> to purchase a 51% stake in the thrift for about $34 million. 
Also named in the suit is <ORGANIZATION>Ivan F. Boesky Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Northview Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the successor company to <ORGANIZATION>Vagabonds Hotels</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Financial Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it agreed to buy the bonds after a representative of <ORGANIZATION>Ivan F. Boesky Corp.</ORGANIZATION> visited it in November 1983 and said <ORGANIZATION>Financial Corp.</ORGANIZATION> could improve its financial condition by purchasing the bonds.
Shortly before the visit, <PERSON>Mr. Boesky</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> representives had met with <ORGANIZATION>Financial Corp.</ORGANIZATION> officials and had signed a letter of intent to acquire the 51% stake in the company.
If a hostile predator emerges for <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi & Saatchi Co.</ORGANIZATION>, co-founders <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Maurice Saatchi</ORGANIZATION> will lead a management buy-out attempt, an official close to the company said. 
But the beleaguered <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> advertising and consulting giant, which last week named a new chief executive officer to replace <PERSON>Maurice Saatchi</PERSON>, has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for weeks. 
Last week, <LOCATION>Saatchi</LOCATION>'s largest shareholder, <ORGANIZATION>Southeastern Asset Management</ORGANIZATION>, said it had been approached by one or more third parties interested in a possible restructuring.
And <PERSON>Carl Spielvogel</PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi's big Backer Spielvogel Bates</ORGANIZATION> advertising unit, said he had offered to lead a management buy-out of the company, but was rebuffed by <PERSON>Charles Saatchi</PERSON>.
The executive close to <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi & Saatchi</ORGANIZATION> said that "if a bidder came up with a ludicrously high offer, a crazy offer which <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi</ORGANIZATION> knew it couldn't beat, it would have no choice but to recommend it to shareholders.
The executive said any buy-out would be led by the current board, whose chairman is <PERSON>Maurice Saatchi</PERSON> and whose strategic guiding force is believed to be <PERSON>Charles Saatchi</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr. Spielvogel</PERSON> isn't part of the board, nor are any of the other heads of <LOCATION>Saatchi</LOCATION>'s big U.S.-based ad agencies. 
That speculation abounded Friday as industry executives analyzed the appointment of the new chief executive, <PERSON>Robert Louis-Dreyfus</PERSON>, who joins <LOCATION>Saatchi</LOCATION> and becomes a member of its board on Jan. 1.
<PERSON>Mr. Louis-Dreyfus</PERSON>, formerly chief executive of the pharmaceutical research firm <ORGANIZATION>IMS International Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, has a reputation as a savvy financial manager, and will be charged largely with repairing <PERSON>Saatchi</PERSON>'s poor financial state. 
"It hasn't had any impact on us, nor do we expect it to," said a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION>Miller Brewing Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a major client of <ORGANIZATION>Backer Spielvogel</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>John Lampe</PERSON>, director of advertising at <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising</ORGANIZATION> client, said: "We have no problem with the announcement, because we don't know what change it's going to bring about.
Executives at <ORGANIZATION>Backer Spielvogel</ORGANIZATION> client <ORGANIZATION>Avis Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, as well as at <LOCATION>Saatchi</LOCATION> client <ORGANIZATION>Philips Lighting Co.</ORGANIZATION>, also said they saw no effect.
Executives at <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Backer Spielvogel</ORGANIZATION> client that is reviewing its account, declined comment.
<PERSON>Mr. Spielvogel</PERSON> had said that Prudential-Bache was prepared to finance either a management buy-out and restructuring, or a buy-out of <ORGANIZATION>Backer Spielvogel</ORGANIZATION> alone, led by him. 
NEW ACCOUNT: <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Glendale Federal Bank</ORGANIZATION> awarded its $12 million to $15 million account to the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION>Omnicom Group</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>BBDO</ORGANIZATION> agency.
The account was previously handled by <PERSON>Davis</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Ball & Colombatto Advertising Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> agency. 
ACCOUNT REVIEW: <ORGANIZATION>Royal Crown Cola Co.</ORGANIZATION> has ended its relationship with the <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> office of <PERSON>Hill</PERSON>, Holliday, <ORGANIZATION>Connors</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Cosmopulos</PERSON>.
NOT-GUILTY PLEA: As expected, <ORGANIZATION>Young & Rubicam Inc.</ORGANIZATION> along with two senior executives and a former employee, pleaded not guilty in federal court in <LOCATION>New Haven</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, to conspiracy and racketeering charges.
A spokesman for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Attorney's office said extradition proceedings are "just beginning" for the other two defendants in the case, <PERSON>Eric Anthony Abrahams</PERSON>, former Jamaican tourism minister, and <PERSON>Jamaican</PERSON> businessman <PERSON>Arnold Foote Jr</PERSON>. 
KOREAN AGENCY: The <ORGANIZATION>Samsung Group</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Bozell Inc.</ORGANIZATION> agreed to establish a joint venture advertising agency in <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Bozell Cheil Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, as the new agency will be called, will be based in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> and is 70% owned by <ORGANIZATION>Samsung</ORGANIZATION> and 30% owned by <ORGANIZATION>Bozell</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Samsung</ORGANIZATION> already owns <ORGANIZATION>Korea First Advertising Co.</ORGANIZATION>, that country's largest agency.
<ORGANIZATION>Bozell</ORGANIZATION> joins <ORGANIZATION>Backer Spielvogel Bates</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy Group</ORGANIZATION> as <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> agencies with interests in <LOCATION>Korean</LOCATION> agencies. 
At <LOCATION>Quantum</LOCATION>, which is based in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the trouble is magnified by the company's heavy dependence on plastics.
Once known as <ORGANIZATION>National Distillers & Chemical Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the company exited the wine and spirits business and plowed more of its resources into plastics after <PERSON>Mr. Stookey</PERSON> took the chief executive's job in 1986.
But its competitors -- including <ORGANIZATION>Dow Chemical Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Union Carbide Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and several oil giants -- have much broader business interests and so are better cushioned against price swings. 
<PERSON>Kenneth Mitchell</PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION>Dow</ORGANIZATION>'s polyethylene business, says producers were surprised to learn how much inventories had swelled throughout the distribution chain as prices spiraled up. "People were even hoarding bags," he says. 
One doubter is <PERSON>George Krug</PERSON>, a chemical-industry analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Oppenheimer & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and a bear on plastics stocks.
On top of everything else, Quantum confronts a disaster at its plant in <LOCATION>Morris</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill</LOCATION>.
"You say you could have sold X percent of this product and Y percent of that," recalls <PERSON>Theodore Semegran</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton</ORGANIZATION> who went through this exercise during his former career as a chemical engineer. "And then you still have to negotiate." 
Through a venture with its investment banker, <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, Quantum completed in August an acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Petrolane Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in a transaction valued at $1.18 billion.
The name surfacing in rumors is <ORGANIZATION>British Petroleum Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which is looking to expand its polyethylene business in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
Concerning your Sept. 21 page-one article on Prince <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> and the leeches: It's a few hundred years since <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> has been a kingdom.

"We couldn't get dealers to answer their phones," said <PERSON>Robert King</PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION>OTC</ORGANIZATION> trading at <ORGANIZATION>Robinson-Humphrey Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>. "It was {like} the Friday before Black Monday" two years ago. 
Whether unanswered phone calls had any effect or not, Nasdaq stocks sank far less than those on the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> exchanges.
By comparison, the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange Composite</ORGANIZATION> tumbled 5.8% Friday and the <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange Composite</ORGANIZATION> fell 4%. 
"There wasn't a lot of volume because it was just impossible to get stock moved," said <LOCATION>E.E.</LOCATION> "Buzzy" <PERSON>Geduld</PERSON>, president of <PERSON>Herzog</PERSON>, <PERSON>Heine</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Geduld</LOCATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> company that makes markets in thousands of OTC issues. 
<PERSON>Peter DaPuzzo</PERSON>, head of retail equity trading at <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton</ORGANIZATION>, declared: "It was the last hour of trading on a Friday.
<PERSON>James Tarantino</PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION>OTC</ORGANIZATION> trading at <ORGANIZATION>Hambrecht & Quist</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, said, "It was just like two years ago.
<PERSON>Jeremiah Mullins</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>OTC</ORGANIZATION> trading chief at <ORGANIZATION>Dean Witter Reynolds</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said proudly that his company executed every order it received by the close of trading.
<PERSON>Mr. Tarantino</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Hambrecht & Quist</ORGANIZATION> said some prices fell without trades taking place, as market makers kept dropping the prices at which they would buy shares. "Everyone was hitting everyone else's bid," he said. 
<PERSON>Tony Cecin</PERSON>, head of equity trading at <ORGANIZATION>Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, said that <PERSON>Piper Jaffray</PERSON> actually made money on Friday.
<PERSON>Joseph Hardiman</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Securities Dealers</ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the Nasdaq computerized trading system, said that despite the rush of selling, he never considered the situation an "emergency." 
But they are worried. "We were just starting to get the public's confidence back," lamented <PERSON>Mr. Mullins</PERSON> of <PERSON>Dean Witter</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Cecin</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Piper Jaffray</ORGANIZATION> says some action from government policy makers would allay investor fears.
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. DaPuzzo</PERSON> said retail investors nervously sold stock Friday and never returned to bargain-hunt.
In addition, <PERSON>Mr. DaPuzzo</PERSON> said computer-guided program selling of OTC stocks in the Russell Index of 2000 small stocks and the <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor</ORGANIZATION>'s 500-stock Index sent occasional "waves " through the market. 
<ORGANIZATION>McCaw Cellular Communications</ORGANIZATION>, for instance, has offered to buy <ORGANIZATION>LIN Broadcasting</ORGANIZATION> as well as <ORGANIZATION>Metromedia</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> cellular telephone interests, and in a separate transaction, sell certain McCaw properties to <ORGANIZATION>Contel Cellular</ORGANIZATION>.
On a day when negative takeover-related news didn't sit well with investors, <ORGANIZATION>Commercial Intertech</ORGANIZATION>, a maker of engineered metal parts, said <ORGANIZATION>Haas & Partners</ORGANIZATION> advised it that it doesn't plan to pursue its previously reported $27.50-a-share bid to buy the company.
Among other OTC issues, <ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION>, dropped 2 1/8 to 33 7/8; <ORGANIZATION>Laidlaw Transportation</ORGANIZATION> lost 1 1/8 to 19 1/2; the American depositary receipts of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> were off 1/4 to 10 1/4; <ORGANIZATION>MCI Communications</ORGANIZATION> slipped 2 1/4 to 43 1/2; <ORGANIZATION>Apple Computer</ORGANIZATION> fell 3 to 45 3/4 and <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION> dropped 2 1/4 to 66 3/4. 
In response to dwindling domestic supplies, <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Clayton Yeutter</PERSON> last month said the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government would slightly increase the number of acres farmers can plant in wheat for next year and still qualify for federal support payments.
In theory at least, tight supplies next spring could leave the wheat futures market susceptible to a supply-demand squeeze, said <PERSON>Daniel Basse</PERSON>, a futures analyst with <ORGANIZATION>AgResource Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>.
Unseasonably hot, dry weather across large portions of the <LOCATION>Great Plains</LOCATION> and in wheat-growing areas in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> is threatening to reduce the yield from this season's winter wheat crop, said <PERSON>Conrad Leslie</PERSON>, a futures analyst and head of <ORGANIZATION>Leslie Analytical</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>.
The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> hasn't given any clear indication of its wheat purchase plans, but many analysts expect <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> to place sizable orders for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> wheat in the next few months, further supporting prices. "Wheat prices will increasingly pivot off of Soviet demand" in coming weeks, predicted <PERSON>Richard Feltes</PERSON>, vice president, research, for <ORGANIZATION>Refco Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. 
Late Thursday, after the close of trading, the market received what would normally have been a bullish <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> estimate of the 1989-90 <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> orange crop.
"I would continue to look for a stable crude market, at least in futures" trading, said <PERSON>William Hinton</PERSON>, an energy futures broker with <ORGANIZATION>Stotler & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
On the <ORGANIZATION>New York Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>West Texas</LOCATION> Intermediate crude for November delivery finished at $20.89 a barrel, up 42 cents on the day.
"This market still wants to go higher," said <PERSON>Nauman Barakat</PERSON>, a first vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
There also are recurring reports that the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> is having difficulties with its oil exports and that <LOCATION>Nigeria</LOCATION> has about reached its production limit and can't produce as much as it could sell.
Many traders foresee a tightening of near-term supplies, particularly of high-quality crudes such as those produced in the <LOCATION>North Sea</LOCATION> and in <LOCATION>Nigeria</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Honeywell</ORGANIZATION>'s contract totaled $69.7 million, and <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>'s $68.8 million. 
<ORGANIZATION>Boeing Co.</ORGANIZATION> received a $46.7 million <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> contract for developing cable systems for the Minuteman Missile. 
<ORGANIZATION>General Dynamics Corp.</ORGANIZATION> received a $29 million <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> contract for electronic-warfare training sets. 
<ORGANIZATION>Grumman Corp.</ORGANIZATION> received an $18.1 million <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> contract to upgrade aircraft electronics. 
<ORGANIZATION>Avco Corp.</ORGANIZATION> received an $11.8 million <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> contract for helicopter engines. 
"There is an unbelievable amount of space available," says <PERSON>Faith Consolo</PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Garrick-Aug Associates Store Leasing Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
The same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retailing. "As businesses contract or depart, the number of employees who might use retail services shrinks," says <PERSON>Edward A. Friedman</PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Helmsley Spear Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Hooker Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION>Bonwit Teller</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>B. Altman</PERSON>'s, is mired in bankruptcy proceedings and <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale</ORGANIZATION>'s is for sale by its owner, <ORGANIZATION>Campeau Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> retail rents still run well above the going rate in other <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> cities.
By contrast, rentals in the best retail locations in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> rarely top $100 a square foot.
<ORGANIZATION>Precision Castparts Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, will begin trading with the symbol <ORGANIZATION>PCP</ORGANIZATION>.

When Justice <PERSON>William Brennan</PERSON> marks the start of his 34th year on the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> today, the occasion will differ sharply from previous anniversaries of his tenure. 
This role reversal holds true, as well, for his three liberal and moderate allies, Justices <PERSON>Thurgood Marshall</PERSON>, <PERSON>Harry Blackmun</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Stevens</PERSON>. 
Justices <PERSON>Brennan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Stevens</PERSON> appear philosophical about it; Justices <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Blackmun</ORGANIZATION> appear fighting mad. 
The change is most dramatic for <ORGANIZATION>Justice Brennan</ORGANIZATION>, the last survivor of the mid-1960s liberal majority under Chief Justice <PERSON>Earl Warren</PERSON>.
In the seven <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> terms from the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1967, the height of the <ORGANIZATION>Warren Court</ORGANIZATION>'s power, <PERSON>Justice Brennan</PERSON> cast only 25 dissenting votes in 555 cases decided by the court.
He has said that he now knows how Justice <PERSON>John Harlan</PERSON> felt, a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent dissenter from the <ORGANIZATION>Warren Court</ORGANIZATION>'s opinions. 
<ORGANIZATION>Harvard Law School</ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON>Laurence Tribe</PERSON> says there is a "generation-skipping" flavor to current dissents.
The dissenters in the <ORGANIZATION>Warren Court</ORGANIZATION>, he says, appeared to be writing for the short-term, suggesting that the court's direction might change soon. "<PERSON>Brennan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> are speaking in their dissents to a more distant future," he says. 
He concluded his remarks by quoting, emotionally and at some length, according to those present, the late <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON>'s famous "I Have a Dream" speech from the 1963 March on <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. 
If the role these four dissenters are assuming is a familiar one in modern <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> history, it also differs in an important way from recent history, court watchers say. "The dissenters of the <ORGANIZATION>Warren Court</ORGANIZATION> were often defending a legal legacy that they inherited," says Prof.
A.E. <PERSON>Dick Howard</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia Law School</ORGANIZATION>, "but the dissenters today are defending a legacy that they created." 
SOUTH AFRICA FREED the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Sisulu</PERSON> and seven other political prisoners.

<PERSON>Robert Kolb</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ricardo Rodriguez</PERSON>, professors of finance at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Miami</ORGANIZATION>, found evidence that the market is spooked by Friday the 13th.
Professor <PERSON>Kolb</PERSON> says the original study, titled Friday the 13th, <ORGANIZATION>Part VII</ORGANIZATION>, was published tongue-in-cheek.
The thrifts' lawyers claim that the suits, numbering 700 to 1,000 in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> alone, should be dismissed as moot because neither the S&Ls nor the extinct <ORGANIZATION>Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.</ORGANIZATION> has the money to pay judgments. 
The dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court dockets in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and reducing the <ORGANIZATION>FSLIC</ORGANIZATION>'s massive legal bills, which topped $73 million last year. 
The S&L lawyers were encouraged last month by an appellate-court ruling in two cases brought against defunct <ORGANIZATION>Sunbelt Savings & Loan Association of Dallas</ORGANIZATION> by the developers of the <ORGANIZATION>Valley Ranch</ORGANIZATION>, best known as the training center for the <ORGANIZATION>Dallas Cowboys</ORGANIZATION> football team.
<ORGANIZATION>Sunbelt</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>FSLIC</ORGANIZATION> argued to the <ORGANIZATION>Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> "that there will never be any assets with which to satisfy a judgment against <ORGANIZATION>Sunbelt Savings</ORGANIZATION> nor any means to collect from any other party, including <ORGANIZATION>FSLIC</ORGANIZATION>." 
"If true," the court wrote, "this contention would justify dismissal of these actions on prudential grounds." But the court said it lacked enough financial information about <ORGANIZATION>Sunbelt</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>FSLIC</ORGANIZATION> and sent the cases back to federal district court in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Charles Haworth</PERSON>, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION>Sunbelt</ORGANIZATION>, says he plans to file a brief this week urging the district judge to dismiss the suits, because <ORGANIZATION>Sunbelt</ORGANIZATION>'s liabilities exceeded its assets by about $2 billion when federal regulators closed it in August 1988. 
"This institution is just brain dead," says <PERSON>Mr. Haworth</PERSON>, a partner in the <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION>Andrews & Kurth</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> law firm. 
But a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION>Triland Investment Group</ORGANIZATION>, the developer of <ORGANIZATION>Valley Ranch</ORGANIZATION>, dismisses such arguments as a "defense du jour." Attorney <PERSON>Richard Jackson</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> says a judgment for <LOCATION>Triland</LOCATION> could be satisfied in ways other than a monetary award, including the reversal of <ORGANIZATION>Sunbelt</ORGANIZATION>'s foreclosure on <ORGANIZATION>Valley Ranch</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Harold Hill</PERSON>, the con man in <PERSON>Meredith Willson</PERSON>'s "The Music Man," warned the citizens of <LOCATION>River City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, against the game.
Now kindred spirits on <ORGANIZATION>Addison</ORGANIZATION>'s town council have barred the town's fanciest hotel, the <PERSON>Grand Kempinski</PERSON>, from installing three free pool tables in its new lounge. 
Mayor <PERSON>Lynn Spruill</PERSON> and two members of the council said they were worried about setting a precedent that would permit pool halls along <ORGANIZATION>Addison</ORGANIZATION>'s main street.
The council's action is yet another blow to a sport that its fans claim has been maligned unjustly for years. "Obviously they're not in touch with what's going on," says <PERSON>Tom Manske</PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>National Pocket Billiards Association</ORGANIZATION>.
Pool is hot in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, he insists, where "upscale, suit-and-tie places" are adding tables.
So are <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, for instance, saw its population grow by 11,000 people, or 0.4%, between 1987 and 1988, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> says.
Between 1987 and 1988, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> was the only state in the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> to lose population, a loss of 4,000 people.
Six of the 12 midwestern states have been growing steadily since 1980 -- <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>. 
And although <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> suffered slight declines earlier in the decade, they are growing again. 
At the same time, several states in the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> have had their own population turnaround.
Seven states that grew in the early 1980s are now losing population -- <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>. 
Overall, though, the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> still outpace the <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>, and fast-growing states like <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> ensure that the pattern will continue.
At least that's what a survey by <ORGANIZATION>Ernst & Young and Yankelovich</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Clancy</PERSON>, <PERSON>Shulman</PERSON> indicates.
The share of minorities in those positions has risen to 16% from 12%. . . . Per-capita personal income in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> grew faster than inflation last year, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Economic Analysis</ORGANIZATION>.
Per capita personal income ranged from $11,116 in <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> to $23,059 in <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>. . . . There are 13.1 million students in college this fall, up 2% from 1988, the <ORGANIZATION>National Center for Education Statistics</ORGANIZATION> estimates.
<ORGANIZATION>CityFed</ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer, <PERSON>John Atherton</PERSON>, said the loss stems from several factors.
<ORGANIZATION>CityFed</ORGANIZATION> added that significant additional loan-loss provisions may be required by federal regulators as part of the current annual examination of <ORGANIZATION>City Federal Savings Bank</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>CityFed</ORGANIZATION>'s primary subsidiary, based in <LOCATION>Somerset</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J. City Federal</LOCATION> operates 105 banking offices in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Atherton</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>CityFed</ORGANIZATION> will also mark its portfolio of high-yield corporate bonds to market as a result of federal legislation requiring that savings institutions divest themselves of such bonds.
<ORGANIZATION>CityFed</ORGANIZATION> also said it expects to shed its remaining mortgage loan origination operations outside its principal markets in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and, as a result, is taking a charge for discontinued operations. 
It also marks P&G's growing concern that its Japanese rivals, such as <ORGANIZATION>Kao Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, may bring their superconcentrates to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
The Cincinnati consumer-products giant got clobbered two years ago in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> when <PERSON>Kao</PERSON> introduced a powerful detergent, called Attack, which quickly won a 30% stake in the Japanese markets. "They don't want to get caught again," says one industry watcher. 
Retailers in <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, say P&G's new powdered detergent -- to be called Cheer with <ORGANIZATION>Color Guard</ORGANIZATION> -- will be on shelves in that market by early November.
A <ORGANIZATION>P&G</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> started late last month.
The company introduced a superconcentrated <ORGANIZATION>Lemon Cheer</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> after watching the success of Attack.
With the help of <ORGANIZATION>Lemon Cheer</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>P&G</ORGANIZATION>'s share is now estimated to be 12%. 
In the early 1980s, <ORGANIZATION>P&G</ORGANIZATION> tried to launch here a concentrated detergent under the Ariel brand name that it markets in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
And retailers are expected to embrace the product, in part because it will take up less shelf space. "When shelf space was cheap, bigger was better," says <PERSON>Hugh Zurkuhlen</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Bros</ORGANIZATION>.
Competition is bound to get tougher if <PERSON>Kao</PERSON> introduces a product like Attack in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
To be sure, <PERSON>Kao</PERSON> wouldn't have an easy time taking <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market share away from the mighty P&G, which has about 23% of the market. 
Kao officials previously have said they are interested in selling detergents in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, but so far the company has focused on acquisitions, such as last year's purchase of <ORGANIZATION>Andrew Jergens Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> hand-lotion maker.
Some believe <ORGANIZATION>P&G</ORGANIZATION>'s interest in a superconcentrated detergent goes beyond the concern for the Japanese. "This is something P&G would do with or without <PERSON>Kao</PERSON>," says <PERSON>Mr. Zurkuhlen</PERSON>. 
"Two years ago there were massive redemption levels over the weekend and a lot of fear around," said <PERSON>C. Bruce Johnstone</PERSON>, who runs <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Investments</ORGANIZATION>' $5 billion Equity-Income Fund. "This feels more like a one-shot deal.
Windsor Fund's <PERSON>John Neff</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Mutual Series' Michael Price</ORGANIZATION> said they had raised their cash levels to more than 20% and 30%, respectively, this year. 
Even <PERSON>Peter Lynch</PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity</ORGANIZATION>'s $12.7 billion Magellan Fund, the nation's largest stock fund, built up cash to 7% or $850 million.
"There's not nearly as much froth," said <PERSON>John Bogle</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Vanguard Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a big <LOCATION>Valley Forge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, fund company. 
<PERSON>Vincent Bajakian</PERSON>, manager of the $1.8 billion <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION> Fund, added to his positions in Bristol-Myers <PERSON>Squibb</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Woolworth</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Dun & Bradstreet</ORGANIZATION> Friday.
And today he'll be looking to buy drug stocks like <ORGANIZATION>Eli Lilly</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Pfizer</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>American Home Products</ORGANIZATION> whose dividend yields have been bolstered by stock declines. 
<ORGANIZATION>Fidelity</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Lynch</PERSON>, for his part, snapped up <ORGANIZATION>Southern Co.</ORGANIZATION> shares Friday after the stock got hammered.
<PERSON>Elaine Garzarelli</PERSON>, who runs <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's $335 million Sector Analysis Portfolio, predicts the market will open down at least 50 points on technical factors and "some panic selling." But she expects prices to rebound soon and is telling investors she expects the stock market won't decline more than 10% to 15% from recent highs. "This is not a major crash," she said. 
"From the investors' standpoint, institutions and individuals learned a painful lesson . . . by selling at the lows" on Black Monday, said <PERSON>Stephen Boesel</PERSON>, manager of the $580 million <ORGANIZATION>T. Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund</ORGANIZATION>.
"Last time, we got rewarded for going out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst," said <PERSON>John W. Rogers</PERSON>, president of Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION>Ariel Capital Management Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which manages $1.1 billion of stocks. 
Other money managers also opened their wallets. "I was buying at the close (Friday) and I'll be buying again because I know we're getting good value," said <PERSON>Frederick A. Moran</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Moran Asset Management Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Greenwich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION> "There is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash." 
"If you bought after the crash, you did very very well off the bottom," said <PERSON>Stephen B. Timbers</PERSON>, chief investment officer of Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION>Kemper Financial Services Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
"The last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long-term holders, and that they can't react to short-term events, good or bad," said <PERSON>Stephen L. Nesbitt</PERSON>, senior vice president for the pension consultants <ORGANIZATION>Wilshire Associates</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION> "Those that pulled out (of stocks) regretted it," he said, "so I doubt you'll see any significant changes" in institutional portfolios as a result of Friday's decline. 
"You could go down 400 points and still have a good year in the market," said <PERSON>James D. Awad</PERSON>, president of New York-based <ORGANIZATION>BMI Capital Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Neil Weisman</PERSON>, whose New York-based <ORGANIZATION>Chilmark Capital Partners</ORGANIZATION> had converted 85% of its $220 million investment pool to cash in recent months, said he was besieged by Wall Street firms Friday asking him to take stock off their hands. 
The nation's largest short-selling operation is <ORGANIZATION>Feshbach Brothers</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, which said last May that its short positions had shown losses of 10% for the year up to that point. 
<ORGANIZATION>RJR Nabisco Inc.</ORGANIZATION> is disbanding its division responsible for buying network advertising time, just a month after moving 11 of the group's 14 employees to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>. 
A spokesman for the New York-based food and tobacco giant, taken private earlier this year in a $25 billion leveraged buy-out by <ORGANIZATION>Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, confirmed that it is shutting down the <ORGANIZATION>RJR Nabisco Broadcast</ORGANIZATION> unit, and dismissing its 14 employees, in a move to save money.
The spokesman said <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION> is discussing its network-buying plans with its two main advertising firms, FCB/Leber <PERSON>Katz</PERSON> and <PERSON>McCann Erickson</PERSON>. 
The broadcast group had been based in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> until a year ago, when <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION>'s previous management moved it to <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, the company's headquarters before this summer.
One employee with the group said <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION> moved 11 employees of the group back to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> in September because "there was supposed to be a future." He said the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks, wooing them from jobs with advertising agencies. 
The <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the company moved the 11 employees to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> last month because the group had then been in the midst of purchasing ad time for the networks' upcoming season. "The studies {on closing the unit} couldn't be completed until now," he said. 
"I'm not losing faith in the market," said <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON>Christopher Sullivan</PERSON> as he watched the market plunge on a big screen in front of a brokerage firm.
"I think on Monday the small (investors) are going to panic and sell," predicted <PERSON>Mr. Sullivan</PERSON>, whose investments include <ORGANIZATION>AMR Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION> unit and several mutual funds. "And I think institutions are going to come in and buy . . . I'm going to hold on.
Some evinced an optimism that had been rewarded when they didn't flee the market in 1987. "Oh, I bet it'll be up 50 points on Monday," said <PERSON>Lucy Crump</PERSON>, a 78-year-old retired housewife in <LOCATION>Lexington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mrs. Crump</PERSON> said her <ORGANIZATION>Ashwood Investment Club</ORGANIZATION>'s portfolio lost about one-third of its value following the Black Monday crash, "but no one got discouraged, and we gained that back -- and more." 
At the annual congress of the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Investors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> at the Hyatt Regency hotel in <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, the scene was calm.
In fact, some of the association's members -- long-term, buy-and-hold investors -- welcomed the drop in prices. "We hope to take advantage of it," said <PERSON>John Snyder</PERSON>, a member of a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> investors' club.
Not everyone is reacting so calmly, however, and many wonder about the long-term implications of what is widely viewed as the cause of Friday's slide, reluctance by banks to provide financing for a buy-out of <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Marc Perkins</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, investment banker, said the market drop is one of "a tremendous number of signs that the leveraged take-out era is ending.
There's no question that there's a general distaste for leverage among lenders." <PERSON>Mr. Perkins</PERSON> believes, however, that the market could be stabilized if <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON> steps back in to the <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> bidding with an offer of $275 a share. 
<PERSON>Sara Albert</PERSON>, a 34-year-old <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> law student, says she's generally skittish about the stock market and the takeover activity that seems to fuel it. "I have this feeling that it's built on sand," she says, that the market rises "but there's no foundation to it." She and her husband pulled most of their investments out of the market after the 1987 crash, although she still owns some <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION> stock.
Others wonder how many more of these shocks the small investor can stand. "We all assumed October '87 was a one-time shot," said <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> attorney <PERSON>David Greenberg</PERSON>. "We told the little guy it could only happen once in a lifetime, come on back.
Discount brokerage customers "have been in the market somewhat but not whole hog like they were two years ago," says <PERSON>Leslie Quick Jr.</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Quick & Reilly</ORGANIZATION> discount brokerage firm.
<PERSON>Hugo Quackenbush</PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Charles Scwhab Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, says Schwab customers "have been neutral to cautious recently about stocks." Individual investors are still angry about program trading, <PERSON>Mr. Quackenbush</PERSON> says. 
<PERSON>Avner Arbel</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Cornell University</ORGANIZATION> finance professor, says government regulators will have to more closely control program trading to "win back the confidence of the small investor." 
<PERSON>Alan Helfman</PERSON>, general sales manager of a <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> dealership in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, said he and his mother have some joint stock investments, but the overall economy is his chief worry. 
"These high rollers took a big bath today," he said in his showroom, which is within a few miles of the multi-million dollar homes of some of <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>'s richest citizens. "And I can tell you that a high roller isn't going to come in tomorrow and buy a <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler TC</ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON>Maserati</PERSON>." And, finally, there were the gloaters. "I got out in 1987.
Everything," said <PERSON>Pascal Antori</PERSON>, an <LOCATION>Akron</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, plumbing contractor who was visiting <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> and stopped by <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Investments</ORGANIZATION>' LaSalle Street office. "I just stopped by to see how much I would have lost." 
"For some of these companies, this will be the first quarter with year-to-year negative comparisons," says <PERSON>Leonard Bogner</PERSON>, a chemical industry analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Prudential Bache Research</ORGANIZATION>. "This could be the first of five or six down quarters." 
Analysts' third-quarter estimates for the <LOCATION>Midland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, company are between $3.20 a share and $3.30 a share, compared with $3.36 a year ago, when profit was $632 million on sales of $4.15 billion.
At the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION>Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the commodity-chemical segment is seen pulling down overall profit for 20 companies representative of the whole industry by 8% to 10%. "You will find the commodities off more than the others and the diversified companies about even or slightly better," says <PERSON>James Wilbur</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Smith Barney</ORGANIZATION> analyst. 
Moreover, the <LOCATION>Wilmington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Del.</LOCATION>, company is helped when prices weaken on the commodity chemicals it buys for its own production needs, such as ethylene. 
Analysts are divided over whether <ORGANIZATION>Du Pont</ORGANIZATION> will report much of a gain in the latest quarter from its <ORGANIZATION>Conoco Inc.</ORGANIZATION> oil company.
<ORGANIZATION>Monsanto Co.</ORGANIZATION>, too, is expected to continue reporting higher profit, even though its sales of crop chemicals were hurt in the latest quarter by drought in northern <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and the western <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
Searle continued to operate in the red through the first half of the year, but <ORGANIZATION>Monsanto</ORGANIZATION> has said it expects <ORGANIZATION>Searle</ORGANIZATION> to post a profit for all of 1989. 
For <ORGANIZATION>Himont Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, "how far down it is, we don't know," says <PERSON>Leslie Ravitz</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers</ORGANIZATION>.
At <ORGANIZATION>Quantum Chemical Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the trouble is lower prices for polyethylene, higher debt costs and the idling of an important plant due to an explosion.
<PERSON>C.S. Richardson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Atco</ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president, finance, said its 50.1%-owned <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Utilities Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> unit is reviewing cogeneration projects in eastern <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, and conventional electric power generating plants elsewhere, including <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, where the British government plans to allow limited competition in electrical generation from private-sector suppliers as part of its privatization program. 
They can be C$1 billion plus," <PERSON>Mr. Richardson</PERSON> said. "But we wouldn't go into them alone," and <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Utilities</ORGANIZATION>' equity stake would be small, he said. "Ideally, we'd like to be the operator {of the project} and a modest equity investor.
<ORGANIZATION>Canadian Utilities</ORGANIZATION> had 1988 revenue of C$1.16 billion, mainly from its natural gas and electric utility businesses in <LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION>, where the company serves about 800,000 customers. 
"There seems to be a move around the world to deregulate the generation of electricity," <PERSON>Mr. Richardson</PERSON> said, and <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Utilities</ORGANIZATION> hopes to capitalize on it. "This is a real thrust on our utility side," he said, adding that <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Utilities</ORGANIZATION> is also mulling projects in underdeveloped countries, though he would be specific. 
<ORGANIZATION>Canadian Utilities</ORGANIZATION> isn't alone in exploring power generation opportunities in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, in anticipation of the privatization program. "We're certainly looking at some power generating projects in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>," said <PERSON>Bruce Stram</PERSON>, vice president, corporate strategy and corporate planning, with <ORGANIZATION>Enron Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, a big natural gas producer and pipeline operator. 
<PERSON>Mr. Stram</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Enron</LOCATION> is considering building gas-fired power plants in the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> capable of producing about 500 megawatts of power at a cost of about $300 million to $400 million. 
Neither Vitarine nor any of the <LOCATION>Springfield Gardens</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, company's officials or employees have been charged with any crimes.
<ORGANIZATION>Vitarine</ORGANIZATION> won approval to market a version of a blood pressure medicine but acknowledged that it substituted a <ORGANIZATION>SmithKline Beecham PLC</ORGANIZATION> product as its own in tests. 
<PERSON>Mr. Nesbit</PERSON> also said the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> has asked <ORGANIZATION>Bolar Pharmaceutical Co.</ORGANIZATION> to recall at the retail level its urinary tract antibiotic.
<PERSON>Bolar</PERSON>, the subject of a criminal investigation by the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> and the Inspector General's office of the <ORGANIZATION>Health and Human Services Department</ORGANIZATION>, only agreed to recall two strengths of its version of <PERSON>Macrodantin</PERSON> "as far down as direct customers, mostly wholesalers," <PERSON>Mr. Nesbit</PERSON> said. 
<PERSON>Bolar</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Copiague</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, earlier began a voluntary recall of both its 100 milligram and 50 milligram versions of the drug. 
The <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> has said it presented evidence it uncovered to the company indicating that <ORGANIZATION>Bolar</ORGANIZATION> substituted the brand-name product for its own to gain government approval to sell generic versions of <LOCATION>Macrodantin</LOCATION>.
Heavy selling of <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor</ORGANIZATION>'s 500-stock index futures in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> relentlessly beat stocks downward. 
Seven <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> stocks -- <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>BankAmerica</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Walt Disney</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Capital Cities/ABC</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Philip Morris</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Telesis Group</ORGANIZATION> -- stopped trading and never resumed. 
Once again {the specialists} were not able to handle the imbalances on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>," said <PERSON>Christopher Pedersen</PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Twenty-First Securities Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
Countered <PERSON>James Maguire</PERSON>, chairman of specialists <ORGANIZATION>Henderson Brothers Inc.</ORGANIZATION>: "It is easy to say the specialist isn't doing his job.
Shares of <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, were extremely active all day Friday, reacting to news and rumors about the proposed $6.79 billion buy-out of the airline by an employee-management group.
At 2:43 p.m. EDT, came the sickening news: The <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> was halting trading in <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>, "pending news." On the exchange floor, "as soon as <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stopped trading, we braced for a panic," said one top floor trader.
And 10 minutes after the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> trading halt came news that the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> group couldn't get financing for its bid.
For example, their selling caused trading halts to be declared in <ORGANIZATION>USAir Group</ORGANIZATION>, which closed down 3 7/8 to 41 1/2, <ORGANIZATION>Delta Air Lines</ORGANIZATION>, which fell 7 3/4 to 69 1/4, and <ORGANIZATION>Philips Industries</ORGANIZATION>, which sank 3 to 21 1/2. 
But as panic spread, speculators began to sell blue-chip stocks such as <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines</ORGANIZATION> to offset their losses.
When trading was halted in <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris</ORGANIZATION>, the stock was trading at 41, down 3 3/8, while <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> closed 5 5/8 lower at 102. 
Under an agreement signed by the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, trading was temporarily halted in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. 
After the trading halt in the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 pit in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, waves of selling continued to hit stocks themselves on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>, and specialists continued to notch prices down.
Meanwhile, during the the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> trading halt, <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> futures sell orders began piling up, while stocks in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> kept falling sharply. 
<ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>John J. Phelan</PERSON> said yesterday the circuit breaker "worked well mechanically.
Futures traders say the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> was signaling that the <ORGANIZATION>Dow</ORGANIZATION> could fall as much as 200 points. 
That's when <PERSON>George L. Ball</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Prudential Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> unit, took to the internal intercom system to declare that the plunge was only "mechanical." 
At <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the nation's biggest brokerage firm, a news release was prepared headlined "<ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch Comments</ORGANIZATION> on Market Drop." The release cautioned that "there are significant differences between the current environment and that of October 1987" and that there are still "attractive investment opportunities" in the stock market. 
However, <PERSON>Jeffrey B. Lane</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said that Friday's plunge is "going to set back" relations with customers, "because it reinforces the concern of volatility.
<PERSON>Jeffrey Yass</PERSON> of program trader <ORGANIZATION>Susquehanna Investment Group</ORGANIZATION> said 2,000 <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> contracts were for sale on the close, the equivalent of $330 million in stock.
The <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Grasso</PERSON> said, "Our systemic performance was good." But the exchange will "look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks.
<ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION>'s surprising strength is one example of the difficulty facing investors looking for reassurances about the financial health of the computer firms. "It's hard to know what to expect at this point," said <PERSON>Peter Rogers</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Robertson Stephens & Co.</ORGANIZATION> "The industry defies characterization." 
Among those companies expected to have a down quarter are <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Amdahl Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sun Microsystems Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, generally solid performers in the past.
Until recently, <PERSON>Adobe</PERSON> had a lock on the market for image software, but last month <ORGANIZATION>Apple</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Adobe</ORGANIZATION>'s biggest customer, and <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> rebelled.
Now the two firms are collaborating on an alternative to <ORGANIZATION>Adobe</ORGANIZATION>'s approach, and analysts say they are likely to carry <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>, the biggest seller of personal computers, along with them. 
<PERSON>John Warnock</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Adobe</ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer, said the <LOCATION>Mountain View</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, company has been receiving 1,000 calls a day about the product since it was demonstrated at a computer publishing conference several weeks ago. 
Meanwhile, competition between various operating systems, which control the basic functions of a computer, spells trouble for software firms generally. "It creates uncertainty and usually slows down sales," said <PERSON>Russ Crabs</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Soundview Financial Group</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Crabs</PERSON> said this probably is behind the expected weak performance of <ORGANIZATION>Aldus Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, maker of a widely used computer publishing program.
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> is backing one type of bus called microchannel, while the nine other leading computer makers, including H-P and <ORGANIZATION>Compaq Computer Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, have chosen another method. 
"Users don't care about the bus," said <PERSON>Daniel Benton</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co</ORGANIZATION>.
In personal computers, <ORGANIZATION>Apple</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> are expected to tighten their hold on their business.
<ORGANIZATION>Wyse Technology</ORGANIZATION>, for instance, is considered a candidate to sell its troubled operation. "Wyse has done well establishing a distribution business, but they haven't delivered products that sell," said <PERSON>Kimball Brown</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities</ORGANIZATION>.
As a result of this trend, longtime powerhouses H-P, <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment Corp.</ORGANIZATION> are scrambling to counterattack with microprocessor-based systems of their own.
<PERSON>Mr. Benton</PERSON> expects <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION> to unveil a family of high-end personal computers later this year that are powerful enough to serve as the hub for communications within large networks of desk-top machines. 
<ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, in a series of moves that angered union officials in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, has signaled that as many as five North American assembly plants may not survive the mid-1990s as the corporation struggles to cut its excess vehicle-making capacity. 
In announcements to workers late last week, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> effectively signed death notices for two full-sized van assembly plants, and cast serious doubt on the futures of three <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> car factories. 
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> is under intense pressure to close factories that became unprofitable as the giant auto maker's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market share skidded during the past decade.
Just a month ago, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> announced it would make an aging assembly plant in <LOCATION>Lakewood</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, the eighth <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> assembly facility to close since 1987. 
One reason is mounting competition from new Japanese car plants in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> can match.
The problem, however, is that <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s moves are coming at a time when <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> leaders are trying to silence dissidents who charge the union is too passive in the face of <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> layoffs.
Against that backdrop, <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON>Stephen P. Yokich</PERSON>, who recently became head of the union's <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> department, issued a statement Friday blasting <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s "flagrant insensitivity" toward union members.
Production of full-sized vans will be consolidated into a single plant in <LOCATION>Flint</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich</LOCATION>.
That means two plants -- one in Scarborough, <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>, and the other in <LOCATION>Lordstown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> -- probably will be shut down after the end of 1991.
<PERSON>Robert White</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Auto Workers</ORGANIZATION> union president, used the impending <ORGANIZATION>Scarborough</ORGANIZATION> shutdown to criticize the <LOCATION>U.S.-Canada</LOCATION> free trade agreement and its champion, Prime Minister <PERSON>Brian Mulroney</PERSON>. 
But Canadian auto workers may benefit from a separate <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> move that affects three <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> car plants and one in <LOCATION>Quebec</LOCATION>. 
Workers at plants in <LOCATION>Van Nuys</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma City</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pontiac</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, were told their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the <ORGANIZATION>Pontiac Firebird</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Chevrolet Camaro</ORGANIZATION> muscle cars.
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> is studying whether it can build the new Camaro-Firebird profitably at a plant in <LOCATION>St. Therese</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Quebec</LOCATION>, company and union officials said. 
That announcement left union officials in <LOCATION>Van Nuys</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oklahoma City</LOCATION> uncertain about their futures.
<PERSON>Jerry Shrieves</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> local president, said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a "flex plant," which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand. 
At the <LOCATION>Oklahoma City</LOCATION> plant, which employs about 6,000 workers building the eight-year-old A-body mid-sized cars, <PERSON>Steve Featherston</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> local vice president, said the plant has no new product lined up, and "none of us knows" when the A-body cars will die.
At <LOCATION>Pontiac</LOCATION>, however, the Camaro-Firebird decision appears to erase <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> hopes that <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> would reopen the shuttered assembly plant that last built the plastic-bodied, two-seater <ORGANIZATION>Pontiac Fiero</ORGANIZATION> model. 
The Fiero plant was viewed as a model of union-management cooperation at <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> before slow sales of the <LOCATION>Fiero</LOCATION> forced the company to close the factory last year.
Dissident <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> members have used the <LOCATION>Fiero</LOCATION> plant as a symbol of labor-management cooperation's failure. 
<ORGANIZATION>MedChem Products Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. District Court</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> ruled that a challenge by <ORGANIZATION>MedChem</ORGANIZATION> to the validity of a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> patent held by <ORGANIZATION>Pharmacia Inc.</ORGANIZATION> was "without merit." 
<LOCATION>Pharmacia</LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION>Upsala</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, had charged in a lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION>MedChem</ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION>MedChem</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>AMVISC</ORGANIZATION> product line infringes on the <LOCATION>Pharmacia</LOCATION> patent.
A <ORGANIZATION>MedChem</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the products contribute about a third of <ORGANIZATION>MedChem</ORGANIZATION>'s sales and 10% to 20% of its earnings. 
It said it is considering "all of its options in light of the decision, including a possible appeal." The medical-products company added that it plans to "assert its other defenses" against <LOCATION>Pharmacia</LOCATION>'s lawsuit, including the claim that it hasn't infringed on <LOCATION>Pharmacia</LOCATION>'s patent. 
<ORGANIZATION>MedChem</ORGANIZATION> said that the court scheduled a conference for next Monday -- to set a date for proceedings on <LOCATION>Pharmacia</LOCATION>'s motion for a preliminary injunction. 
The 1987 crash was "a false alarm however you view it," says <ORGANIZATION>University of Chicago</ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON>Victor Zarnowitz</PERSON>. 
Its spasms can't be traced to fundamental business conditions, nor do they appear to presage major shifts in the economy. "The market today has a life of its own," <PERSON>John Akers</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said Saturday. "There's nothing rational about this kind of action." 
The dollar also began to decline Friday as the stock market's plunge caused some investors to reassess their desire to invest in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> officials have been arguing for months that the dollar's strength was out of whack with economic fundamentals, threatening to extinguish the export boom that has sustained manufacturers for several years.
The plunge in stock prices "is happening at a time when the economy has already slowed down," says economist <PERSON>Lawrence Chimerine</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>WEFA Group</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Bala Cynwyd</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, forecasting company. "A lot of pent-up demand is gone." 
Even before Friday's events, <ORGANIZATION>Harvard University</ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON>Benjamin Friedman</PERSON> was arguing that the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> won't be able to live up to its tough words on eliminating inflation because of its responsibility to protect fragile financial markets, banks and highly leveraged corporations.
If the reactions of executives gathered Saturday at <LOCATION>Hot Springs</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, for the <ORGANIZATION>Business Council</ORGANIZATION> meetings are typical, business leaders weren't overly rattled by Friday's decline.
As <PERSON>Sen. Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>) observed yesterday, "The <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> avoided a meltdown last time.
<PERSON>Mr. Thygerson</PERSON> said he had planned to travel between the job in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> and his <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> home, but has found the commute too difficult to continue.
Further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> from easing credit, the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that retail sales grew 0.5% in September, to $145.21 billion.
"I think the Friday report, combined with the actions of the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>, weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy," said <PERSON>Robert Dederick</PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION>Northern Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. 
"The overall 0.9% increase is serious in itself, but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy, the producer price index still increased by 0.7%," said <PERSON>Gordon Richards</PERSON>, an economist at the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Manufacturers</ORGANIZATION>. 
But <PERSON>Sung Won Sohn</PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION>Norwest Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the September jump. "I would say this is not bad news; this is a blip," he said. "The core rate is not really out of line." 
Analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index, but the 0.9% climb was higher than most anticipated. "I think the resurgence {in inflation} is going to continue for a few months," said <PERSON>John Mueller</PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION>Bell Mueller Cannon</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> economic forecasting firm.
But <PERSON>Dirk Van Dongen</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors</ORGANIZATION>, said that last month's rise "isn't as bad an omen" as the 0.9% figure suggests. "If you examine the data carefully, the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices, rather than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods," he explained. 
The <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> has a wonderful botanical garden, a great zoo, its own charming <LOCATION>Little Italy</LOCATION> (on Arthur Avenue) and, of course, the <ORGANIZATION>Yankees</ORGANIZATION>.
However, most people, having been subjected to news footage of the devastated <LOCATION>South Bronx</LOCATION>, look at the borough the way <PERSON>Tom Wolfe</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Sherman McCoy</PERSON> did in "Bonfire of the Vanities" -- as a wrong turn into hell. 
But <PERSON>Laura Cunningham</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>, her childhood <PERSON>Bronx</PERSON> of the '50s, is something else altogether.
In a lovely, novelistic memoir, "Sleeping Arrangements" (<ORGANIZATION>Knopf</ORGANIZATION>, 195 pages, $18.95), she remembers an exotic playground, peopled mainly by Jewish eccentrics and the occasional Catholic (real oddballs like her sexpot friend, the hell-kitten <PERSON>Diana</PERSON>, age five). 
She transforms her "<PERSON>Bronx</PERSON> of the emotions, a place where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria" into the "<LOCATION>Babylonian Bronx</LOCATION>," a world simmering with sex and death and intrigue.
In the <LOCATION>Babylonian Bronx</LOCATION>, Jewish working-class people lived in drab, Soviet-style buildings "glamorized" with names like <ORGANIZATION>AnaMor Towers</ORGANIZATION> (after owners <LOCATION>Anna</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Morris Snezak</PERSON>), whose lobbies and hallways were decorated with murals of ancient Syrians and Greeks, friezes of <LOCATION>Pompeii</LOCATION>. 
For <PERSON>Ms. Cunningham</PERSON> the architectural discombobulation matched the discrepancy she felt living in the AnaMor Towers as a little girl: ". . . outwardly ordinary, inwardly ornate, owing all inspiration to heathen cultures." Sharp-witted and funny but never mean, she's a memorialist a bit like <PERSON>Truman Capote</PERSON>, if he'd been Jewish and female and less bitchy. 
She was raised, for the first eight years, by her mother, <PERSON>Rosie</PERSON>, whom she remembers as a loving liar, who realigned history to explain why <ORGANIZATION>Lily</ORGANIZATION>'s father didn't live with them.
<PERSON>Rosie</PERSON> reinvented this man, who may or may not have known about his child, as a war hero for <ORGANIZATION>Lily</ORGANIZATION>'s benefit. 
<PERSON>Rosie</PERSON> died young and <PERSON>Lily</PERSON> has remembered her as a romantic figure, who didn't interfere much with her child's education on the streets.
The games <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> children played (holding kids down and stripping them, for example) seem tame by today's crack standards, but <PERSON>Ms. Cunningham</PERSON> makes it all sound like a great adventure. "Without official knowledge of sex or death, we flirted with both," she writes.
With loving detail she recalls her Uncle Gabe, an <PERSON>Orthodox Jew</PERSON> and song lyricist (who rhymed river with liver in a love song); and <ORGANIZATION>Uncle Len</ORGANIZATION>, a mysterious part-time investigator who looked like <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> and carried a change of clothing in a <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> envelope, like an "undercover President on a good-will mission." 
The <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> also figures in <PERSON>Bruce Jay Friedman</PERSON>'s latest novel, which flashes back to the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> of the '50s.
For his sixth novel, <PERSON>Mr. Friedman</PERSON> tried to resuscitate the protagonist of his 1972 work, "About Harry Towns." Harry is now a 57-year-old writer, whose continuing flirtation with drugs and marginal types in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> seems quaintly out-of-synch.
Harry fondly remembers the "old" days of the early '70s, when people like his friend <PERSON>Travis</PERSON> would take a psychiatrist on a date to analyze what <PERSON>Travis</PERSON> was doing wrong. "An <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> solution," explains <PERSON>Mr. Friedman</PERSON>. 
Line by line <PERSON>Mr. Friedman</PERSON>'s weary cynicism can be amusing, especially when he's riffing on the <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> social scheme -- the way people size each other up, immediately canceling the desperate ones who merely almost made it.
Harry has avoided all that by living in a <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION> suburb with his wife, who's so addicted to soap operas and mystery novels she barely seems to notice when her husband disappears for drug-seeking forays into <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>. 
Two of the four big thrifts were sold to <ORGANIZATION>NCNB Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, which has aggressively expanded its markets, particularly in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>NCNB</ORGANIZATION>, for example, has been one of the highest rate payers in the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> market, and in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, rates are especially sensitive in retirement communities. 
The <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION> had previously targeted five thrifts for quick sales in order to spend cash by certain budgetary deadlines, but the delays illustrate the tough chore facing the agency. "These thrifts are beached whales," said <PERSON>Bert Ely</PERSON>, an industry consultant based in <LOCATION>Alexandria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va</LOCATION>.
For example, the delay in selling People's <ORGANIZATION>Heritage Savings</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Salina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kan.</LOCATION>, with $1.7 billion in assets, has forced the <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION> to consider selling off the thrift branch-by-branch, instead of as a whole institution. 
<ORGANIZATION>NCNB</ORGANIZATION> continued its foray into the <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> markets.
<ORGANIZATION>NCNB</ORGANIZATION> will acquire <ORGANIZATION>University Federal Savings Association</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Houston</ORGANIZATION>, which had assets of $2.8 billion.
<ORGANIZATION>NCNB Texas National Bank</ORGANIZATION> will pay the <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION> a premium of $129 million for $3.5 billion in deposits.
As a measure of the depths to which the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> real estate market has sunk, the <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION> will pay $3.8 billion to <ORGANIZATION>NCNB</ORGANIZATION> to take $750 million of bad assets. 
<ORGANIZATION>NCNB</ORGANIZATION> also acquired <ORGANIZATION>Freedom Savings & Loan Association</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, which had total assets of $900 million.
<ORGANIZATION>NCNB</ORGANIZATION> will pay the <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION> a premium of $40.4 million for $1.1 billion in deposits.
<ORGANIZATION>NCNB</ORGANIZATION> will also acquire $266 million of <ORGANIZATION>Freedom</ORGANIZATION>'s assets from the <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION>, which will require $875 million in assistance. 
<ORGANIZATION>Meridian Bancorp Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, Reading, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, will acquire <ORGANIZATION>Hill Financial Savings Association</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Red Hill</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, which had $2.3 billion in assets.
In the first <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION> transaction with a foreign buyer, <ORGANIZATION>Royal Trustco Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>, will acquire <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Savings Bank</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Costa Mesa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, which had $949 million in assets.
<ORGANIZATION>Royal Trustco</ORGANIZATION> will pay the <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION> $25 million to assume $989 million in deposits.
The only thing <PERSON>Robert Goldberg</PERSON> could praise about <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>'s new show "Island Son" (Leisure & Arts, Sept. 25) was the local color; unfortunately neither he nor the producers of the show have done their homework.
A spokeswoman said <PERSON>Sulka</PERSON> operates a total of seven stores in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and overseas.
The company's net worth cannot fall below $185 million after the dividends are issued. "The terms of that agreement only become effective the date of <LOCATION>Gulf</LOCATION>'s reorganization, which we anticipate will occur sometime in early 1990," said <PERSON>Lawrence R. Mehl</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Gulf</LOCATION>'s general counsel. 
"We're putting a deficit-reduction bill back in the category of being a deficit-reduction bill," said <ORGANIZATION>Senate Budget Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>James Sasser</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>). 
But <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> supporters of the trimmer legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside, including a capital-gains tax cut.
"No one can predict exactly what will happen on the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> side," said <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON>Robert Dole</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Kan.</LOCATION>).
<ORGANIZATION>House Budget Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Leon Panetta</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>) said in an interview, "If that's the signal that comes from the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>, that will help a great deal." 
The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>'s decision was a setback for President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and will make approval of a capital-gains tax cut less certain this year.
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON>George Mitchell</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>) said he was "confident" that any <ORGANIZATION>House-Senate</ORGANIZATION> agreement on the deficit-reduction legislation wouldn't include a capital-gains tax cut.
The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> bill was pared back in an attempt to speed deficit-reduction through <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
A key is whether <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Republicans are willing to acquiesce to their <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> colleagues' decision to drop many pet provisions. 
"Although I am encouraged by the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> action," said Chairman <PERSON>Dan Rostenkowski</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>) of the <ORGANIZATION>House Ways and Means Committee</ORGANIZATION>, "it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the upcoming conference with the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>." 
Also missing from the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> bill is the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>'s repeal of a law, called Section 89, that compels companies to give rank-and-file workers comparable health benefits to top paid executives. 
One high-profile provision that was originally in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by Chairman <PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>) of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Finance Committee</ORGANIZATION> to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts.
<PERSON>Mr. Bentsen</PERSON> said he hopes the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> will consider that measure soon. 
To the delight of some doctors, the bill dropped a plan passed by the <ORGANIZATION>Finance Committee</ORGANIZATION> that would have overhauled the entire physician-reimbursement system under <ORGANIZATION>Medicare</ORGANIZATION>.
Asked why senators were giving up so much, <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> <PERSON>Sen. Pete Domenici</PERSON>, the ranking <ORGANIZATION>Republican</ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Budget Committee</ORGANIZATION>, said, "We're looking like idiots.
The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> also dropped a plan by its <ORGANIZATION>Finance Committee</ORGANIZATION> that would have increased the income threshold beyond which senior citizens have their <ORGANIZATION>Social Security</ORGANIZATION> benefits reduced.
The approval of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> bill was especially sweet for <PERSON>Sen. Mitchell</PERSON>, who had proposed the streamlining.
<PERSON>Mr. Mitchell</PERSON>'s relations with Budget Director <PERSON>Darman</PERSON>, who pushed for a capital-gains cut to be added to the measure, have been strained since <PERSON>Mr. Darman</PERSON> chose to bypass the <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> Democrat and deal with other lawmakers earlier this year during a dispute over drug funding in the fiscal 1989 supplemental spending bill. 
The measure repeals a 50% exclusion given to banks on the interest from loans used to acquire securities for an <ORGANIZATION>ESOP</ORGANIZATION>, if the <ORGANIZATION>ESOP</ORGANIZATION> owns less than 30% of the employer's stock. 
-- Authority for the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Aviation Administration</ORGANIZATION> to raise $239 million by charging fees for commercial airline-landing rights at <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>LaGuardia</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>John F. Kennedy International Airports</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>O'Hare International Airport</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>National Airport</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. 
-- Direction to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> to collect $50 million from users of <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> services. 
<PERSON>Mr. Newton</PERSON> said he accepted the resignation of <PERSON>Thomas Wilson</PERSON>, vice president of corporate sales, and that his marketing responsibilities have been reassigned.
Ripples from the strike by 55,000 Machinists union members against <ORGANIZATION>Boeing Co.</ORGANIZATION> reached air carriers Friday as <ORGANIZATION>America West Airlines</ORGANIZATION> announced it will postpone its new service out of <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> because of delays in receiving aircraft from the <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> jet maker. 
<PERSON>Peter Otradovec</PERSON>, vice president for planning at the <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, carrier, said in an interview that the work stoppage at <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION>, now entering its 13th day, "has caused some turmoil in our scheduling" and that more than 500 passengers who were booked to fly out of <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> on <LOCATION>America West</LOCATION> would now be put on other airlines. 
<PERSON>Mr. Otradovec</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION>America West</ORGANIZATION> that the 757 it was supposed to get this Thursday wouldn't be delivered until Nov. 7 -- the day after the airline had been planning to initiate service at <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> with four daily flights, including three nonstops to <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> and one nonstop to <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> is also supposed to send to <LOCATION>America West</LOCATION> another 757 twin-engine aircraft as well as a 737 by year's end.
At this point, no other <LOCATION>America West</LOCATION> flights -- including its new service at <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>; and <LOCATION>Palmdale</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION> -- have been affected by the delays in <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> deliveries. 
"I just don't feel that the company can really stand or would want a prolonged walkout," <PERSON>Tom Baker</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Machinists</ORGANIZATION>' District 751, said in an interview yesterday. "I don't think their customers would like it very much." 
<LOCATION>America West</LOCATION>, though, is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be. "I figure that <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their fleets, they might not miss one at all," <PERSON>Mr. Otradovec</PERSON> said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Southwest Airlines</ORGANIZATION> has a <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> 737-300 set for delivery at the end of this month and expects to have the plane on time. "It's so close to completion, <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION>'s told us there won't be a problem," said a <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION> spokesman. 
A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>AMR Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> has assured <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION> it will deliver a 757 on time later this month.
In <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> spokesman explained that the company has been in constant communication with all of its customers and that it was impossible to predict what further disruptions might be triggered by the strike. 
Meanwhile, supervisors and non-striking employees have been trying to finish some 40 aircraft -- mostly 747 and 767 jumbo jets at the company's <LOCATION>Everett</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, plant -- that were all but completed before the walkout.
Though <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION>'s stock price was battered along with the rest of the market Friday, it actually has risen over the last two weeks on the strength of new orders. "The market has taken two views: that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look very rosy for <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> in the long term," said <PERSON>Howard Rubel</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION>'s shares fell $4 Friday to close at $57.375 in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 
Last week, <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Frank Shrontz</PERSON> sent striking workers a letter, saying that "to my knowledge, <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION>'s offer represents the best overall three-year contract of any major <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> industrial firm in recent history." 
-- Talks have broken off between <ORGANIZATION>Machinists</ORGANIZATION> representatives at <ORGANIZATION>Lockheed Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Calabasas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, aerospace company.
-- <ORGANIZATION>United Auto Workers Local 1069</ORGANIZATION>, which represents 3,000 workers at <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION>'s helicopter unit in <LOCATION>Delaware County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, said it agreed to extend its contract on a day-by-day basis, with a 10-day notification to cancel, while it continues bargaining.
-- And <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> on Friday said it received an order from <ORGANIZATION>Martinair Holland</ORGANIZATION> for four model 767-300 wide-body jetliners valued at a total of about $326 million. 
<ORGANIZATION>Pratt & Whitney</ORGANIZATION> is a unit of <ORGANIZATION>United Technologies Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Martinair Holland</ORGANIZATION> is based in <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> said it acquired 5% of the shares in <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar PLC</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>London Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> are being notified of the transactions, the company said. 
The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Federal Trade Commission</ORGANIZATION> advised <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> last week that it wouldn't raise any objection to the acquisition of as much as 15% of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shares. 
<ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it had discussed the possibility of a joint venture with <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> before <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> began buying shares.
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> said it still is talking with <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> about acquiring a minority interest. 
<ORGANIZATION>Southmark Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said that it filed part of its 10-K report with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>, but that the filing doesn't include its audited financial statements and related information. 
Assuming that the market doesn't head into a bottomless free fall, some executives think Friday's action could prove a harbinger of good news -- as a sign that the leveraged buy-out and takeover frenzy of recent years may be abating. "This is a reaction to artificial <ORGANIZATION>LBO</ORGANIZATION> valuations, rather than to any fundamentals," said <PERSON>John Young</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard Co.</ORGANIZATION>, whose shares dropped $3.125 to $48.125. "If we get rid of a lot of that nonsense, it will be a big plus." 
A few of the executives here for the fall meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>Business Council</ORGANIZATION>, a group that meets to discuss national issues, were only too happy to personalize their criticism. "People wish the government would do something about leveraged buy-outs, do something about takeovers, do something about <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>," said <PERSON>Rand Araskog</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>ITT Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, whose stock dropped $3.375. "Where's the leadership?
"I'm not going to worry about one day's decline," said <PERSON>Kenneth Olsen</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment Corp.</ORGANIZATION> president, who was leisurely strolling through the bright orange and yellow leaves of the mountains here after his company's shares plunged $5.75 to close at $86.50. "I didn't bother calling anybody; I didn't even turn on TV." 
"There hasn't been any fundamental change in the economy," added <PERSON>John Smale</PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION>Procter & Gamble Co.</ORGANIZATION> took an $8.75 slide to close at $120.75. "The fact that this happened two years ago and there was a recovery gives people some comfort that this won't be a problem." 
Indeed, one chief executive who was downright delighted by Friday's events was <PERSON>Robert Crandall</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>AMR Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION> and the target of a takeover offer by <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>.
Asked whether Friday's action could help him avoid being Trumped by the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> real estate magnate, <PERSON>Mr. Crandall</PERSON> smiled broadly and said: "No comment." 
Of the 19 economists who worked on the <ORGANIZATION>Business Council</ORGANIZATION> forecast, only two projected periods of decline in the nation's output over the next two years, and in "both instances the declines are too modest to warrant the phrase recession," said <PERSON>Lewis Preston</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>J.P. Morgan & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Business Council</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <LOCATION>Garden City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, car-rental company said it won't renew contracts with <ORGANIZATION>NWA Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Northwest Airlines</ORGANIZATION> unit, <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Pan American World Airways</ORGANIZATION> unit and <ORGANIZATION>Midway Airlines</ORGANIZATION> at the end of this year.
But it remains involved in programs with <ORGANIZATION>AMR Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION> unit and <ORGANIZATION>Delta Air Lines</ORGANIZATION>. 
Budget Rent a <ORGANIZATION>Car Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>National Car Rental Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, both said they had no plans to follow suit.
"I cannot see how this news by <PERSON>Hertz</PERSON> and Avis cannot benefit Budget's programs," said <PERSON>Bob Wilson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Budget</ORGANIZATION>'s vice president, marketing planning.
National also participates in the <ORGANIZATION>Northwest</ORGANIZATION> frequent-flier program along with four other airlines, including <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>USAir Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> unit. 
A month ago, <PERSON>Hertz</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Park Ridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, said that it would drop its marketing agreements at year end with <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>America West</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, and that pacts with <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>UAL Inc</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> also would be ended. . . sometime after Dec. 31.
<PERSON>Robert D. Cardillo</PERSON>, <PERSON>Avis</PERSON> vice president of marketing, said, "The proliferation and costs attached to {frequent-flier programs} have significantly diminished their value." 
Or so it must seem to <PERSON>Jackie Mason</PERSON>, the veteran Jewish comedian appearing in a new <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> sitcom airing on Tuesday nights (9:30-10 p.m. EDT).
Here, in neutral language, is the gist of <PERSON>Mr. Mason</PERSON>'s remarks, quoted first in the <ORGANIZATION>Village Voice</ORGANIZATION> while he was a paid spokesman for the <PERSON>Rudolph Giuliani</PERSON> mayoral campaign, and then in <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION> after he and the campaign parted company.
He said Jews were "sick with complexes"; and he called <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Giuliani</PERSON>'s black opponent, "a fancy shvartze with a mustache." 
For example, the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> state counsel for the <ORGANIZATION>NAACP</ORGANIZATION> said that <PERSON>Mr. Mason</PERSON> is "like a dinosaur.
As <PERSON>Elizabeth Kristol</PERSON> wrote in the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> just before the <LOCATION>Mason</LOCATION> donnybrook, "Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to simmer." The question is, if group conflicts still exist (as undeniably they do), and if <PERSON>Mr. Mason</PERSON>'s type of ethnic humor is passe, then what other means do we have for letting off steam? 
In "Chicken Soup," <PERSON>Mr. Mason</PERSON> plays <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON>, a Jewish bachelor courting Maddie (<PERSON>Lynn Redgrave</PERSON>), an <LOCATION>Irish</LOCATION> widow and mother of three, against the wishes of his mother (<PERSON>Rita Karin</PERSON>) and her brother <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> (<PERSON>Brandon Maggart</PERSON>).
At least, they both speak with strong accents, as do <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> and <PERSON>Maddie</PERSON>.
And a safe one -- imagine if the romance in question were between an Orthodox <PERSON>Jew</PERSON> and a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Nation of Islam</ORGANIZATION>. 
Back in the 1920s, the play and movie versions of "Abie's Irish Rose" made the theme of courtship between the assimilated offspring of Jewish and <LOCATION>Irish</LOCATION> immigrants so popular that its author, <PERSON>Anne Nichols</PERSON>, lost a plagiarism suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public domain.
And it has remained there, as evidenced by its reappearance in a 1972 <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> sitcom called "Bridget Loves <PERSON>Bernie</PERSON>," whose sole distinction was that it led to the real-life marriage of <PERSON>Meredith Baxter</PERSON> and <PERSON>David Birney</PERSON>. 
For instance, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> dislikes <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> not because he's a shrewd Jewish businessman, but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker.
But I am suggesting that they stop requiring <PERSON>Mr. Mason</PERSON> to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about "caring for other people" that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of <LOCATION>Miss America</LOCATION>.
The partnership, <ORGANIZATION>Kaufman & Broad Land Development Venture Limited Partnership</ORGANIZATION>, is a 50-50 joint venture with a trust created by institutional clients of <ORGANIZATION>Heitman Advisory Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Heitman Financial Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a real estate advisory, management and development company with offices in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
The partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development, but in return, it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices, which can result in sizable savings, said <PERSON>Bruce Karatz</PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Kaufman & Broad</ORGANIZATION>. 
By setting up the joint venture, <ORGANIZATION>Kaufman & Broad</ORGANIZATION> can take the more aggressive approach of buying raw land, while avoiding the negative impacts to its own balance sheet, <PERSON>Mr. Karatz</PERSON> said.
Analysts said that <ORGANIZATION>Merck & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Eli Lilly & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Warner-Lambert Co.</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Squibb Corp.</ORGANIZATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.</ORGANIZATION> all benefited from strong sales of relatively new, higher-priced medicines that provide wide profit margins.
Less robust earnings at <ORGANIZATION>Pfizer Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Upjohn Co.</ORGANIZATION> were attributed to those companies' older products, many of which face stiffening competition from generic drugs and other medicines. 
<PERSON>Joseph Riccardo</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Bear, Stearns & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, said that over the past few years most drug makers have shed their slow-growing businesses and instituted other cost savings, such as consolidating manufacturing plants and administrative staffs.
While that's not spectacular, <PERSON>Neil Sweig</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Prudential Bache</ORGANIZATION>, said that the rate of growth will "look especially good as compared to other companies if the economy turns downward." 
<PERSON>Mr. Sweig</PERSON> estimated that <ORGANIZATION>Merck</ORGANIZATION>'s profit for the quarter rose by about 22%, propelled by sales of its line-up of fast-growing prescription drugs, including its anti-cholesterol drug, <ORGANIZATION>Mevacor</ORGANIZATION>; a high blood pressure medicine, <ORGANIZATION>Vasotec</ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON>Primaxin</PERSON>, an antibiotic, and <PERSON>Pepcid</PERSON>, an anti-ulcer medication.
Profit climbed even though <ORGANIZATION>Merck</ORGANIZATION>'s sales were reduced by "one to three percentage points" as a result of the strong dollar, <PERSON>Mr. Sweig</PERSON> said.
In <LOCATION>Rahway</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Merck</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the company doesn't make earnings projections. 
<PERSON>Mr. Sweig</PERSON> said he estimated that <ORGANIZATION>Lilly</ORGANIZATION>'s earnings for the quarter jumped about 20%, largely because of the performance of its new anti-depressant <ORGANIZATION>Prozac</ORGANIZATION>.
In <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Lilly</ORGANIZATION> declined comment. 
In <LOCATION>Morris Plains</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, a spokesman for the company said the analysts' projections are "in the ballpark." 
<PERSON>Mr. Riccardo</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Bear Stearns</ORGANIZATION> said that <ORGANIZATION>Schering-Plough Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's expected profit rise of about 18% to 20%, and <ORGANIZATION>Bristol-Meyers</ORGANIZATION>'s expected profit increase of about 13% are largely because "those companies are really managed well." <ORGANIZATION>ScheringPlough</ORGANIZATION> earned $94.4 million, or 84 cents a share, while <ORGANIZATION>Bristol-Myers</ORGANIZATION> earned $232.3 million, or 81 cents a share, in the like period a year earlier. 
In <LOCATION>Madison</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, a spokesman for <PERSON>Schering-Plough</PERSON> said the company has "no problems" with the average estimate by a analysts that third-quarter earnings per share rose by about 19%, to $1.
Sales of <PERSON>Pfizer</PERSON>'s important drugs, <PERSON>Feldene</PERSON> for treating arthritis, and <LOCATION>Procardia</LOCATION>, a heart medicine, have shrunk because of increased competition. "The (strong) dollar hurt <PERSON>Pfizer</PERSON> a lot, too," <PERSON>Mr. Sweig</PERSON> said.
<ORGANIZATION>Upjohn</ORGANIZATION>'s biggest-selling drugs are <ORGANIZATION>Xanax</ORGANIZATION>, a tranquilizer, and <ORGANIZATION>Halcion</ORGANIZATION>, a sedative. 
Also, the company's hair-growing drug, <PERSON>Rogaine</PERSON>, is selling well -- at about $125 million for the year, but the company's profit from the drug has been reduced by <ORGANIZATION>Upjohn</ORGANIZATION>'s expensive print and television campaigns for advertising, analysts said.
In <LOCATION>Kalamazoo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Upjohn</ORGANIZATION> declined comment. 
<ORGANIZATION>Air & Water</ORGANIZATION>, which provides environmental services and systems, paid about 1.4 million of its shares for <ORGANIZATION>Falcon</ORGANIZATION>.
In <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading Friday, <ORGANIZATION>Air & Water</ORGANIZATION> closed unchanged at $17.50. 
<PERSON>John Lehman</PERSON>'s editorial-page article on the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> as a haunted house omits the real roots of its ghost population ("In the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION>, the Undead Walk," Oct. 18).
The media's treatment of the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION> during the Vietnam War, the <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> administration's denigration of the military, and the public scapegoating of Lt. Col. <PERSON>Oliver North</PERSON> have all served to emasculate the poor souls who live there.
Perhaps the <ORGANIZATION>Halloween</ORGANIZATION> season is a good time for <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to be looking at funding for some ghostbusting equipment. 
Ever since the days of Alfred Thayer Mahan (<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> naval officer and naval historian) and <PERSON>Teddy Roosevelt</PERSON> the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> has been the service most favored by <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> officialdom.
<PERSON>Mr. Lehman</PERSON> overlooks the fact that the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> possesses its own air force (the carrier fleet) and its own army (the <ORGANIZATION>Marines</ORGANIZATION>), which in turn has its own air force. 
Isn't this the same guy who resigned as <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> secretary because he couldn't get his 1,000-ship <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>? 
<LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich</LOCATION>. 
Nor did it ease restrictions on exports to <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials who attended the talks. 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> had been under pressure from several <ORGANIZATION>Cocom</ORGANIZATION> members, especially <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, to ease restrictions on some types of machine tools, which those countries argued were now widely available to <ORGANIZATION>East Bloc</ORGANIZATION> countries from non-Cocom members.
For several years some <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> countries have complained that outdated <ORGANIZATION>Cocom</ORGANIZATION> lists and restrictions served more to hamper their trade than to add to Western security. 
Some countries also have been pressing for special treatment for <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> as they move toward more <ORGANIZATION>democratic</ORGANIZATION> rule, just as special treatment had been agreed on for <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>.
But <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials said representatives at the meeting decided that this was "a matter for further discussion at future meetings." They added that "all of us (<ORGANIZATION>Cocom</ORGANIZATION> members) look at the changes in <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> in a positive way, but a question of this scope deserves further discussion and study." The officials also said the meeting agreed to continue treating <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> as a special case, despite the recent repression of dissent there, but to offer no further concessions. 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials said that despite the rapid changes under way in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, all the <ORGANIZATION>Cocom</ORGANIZATION> members agreed on "the continuing need for this organization," which was founded 40 years ago at the start of the Cold War.
The financial services company emerged from the restructuring of <ORGANIZATION>Kaufman & Broad, Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which spun off its home-building subsidiary into <ORGANIZATION>Kaufman & Broad Home Corp.</ORGANIZATION> earlier this year and changed its name to <ORGANIZATION>Broad Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
In the filing, <PERSON>Crane</PERSON> said that in the past it considered seeking control of <PERSON>Milton Roy</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>St. Petersburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, through a merger or tender offer and that it expects to continue to evaluate an acquisition from time to time.
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading Friday, <ORGANIZATION>Milton Roy</ORGANIZATION> shares leaped $2, to $18.375 each, while Crane sank $1.125, to $21.125 a share. 
<PERSON>John M. McNamara</PERSON>, chief financial officer of <PERSON>Milton Roy</PERSON>, said the company has no comment on <ORGANIZATION>Crane</ORGANIZATION>'s filing. 
<PERSON>Milton Roy</PERSON> recently fended off unsolicited overtures from <ORGANIZATION>Thermo Electron Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Waltham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, maker of biomedical products.
<PERSON>Milton Roy</PERSON> disclosed in May that it was approached for a possible acquisition by <ORGANIZATION>Thermo Electron</ORGANIZATION>, which agreed to purchase <PERSON>Milton Roy</PERSON>'s liquid-chromatography line for $22 million in February.
<ORGANIZATION>Thermo Electron</ORGANIZATION> acquired some 6% of <ORGANIZATION>Milton Roy</ORGANIZATION>'s common stock before throwing in the towel and reducing its stake in early September. 
<ORGANIZATION>Gabelli Group</ORGANIZATION> began raising its <ORGANIZATION>Milton Roy</ORGANIZATION> stake in July, and holds 14.6%, according to a recent <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> filing.
Earlier this month, <PERSON>Milton Roy</PERSON> signed a letter of intent to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Automated Custom Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Orange</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, and its sister operation, <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Testing Co.</ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION>Aurora</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>E.W. Scripps Co.</ORGANIZATION> said it has acquired a <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> cable television company and a <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> publishing firm.
The media company said it purchased <ORGANIZATION>Cable USA Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a privately held cable television system in <LOCATION>Carroll County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>.
The company also has acquired <ORGANIZATION>Sundance Publishers and Distributors Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a family owned producer and distributor of educational materials in <LOCATION>Littleton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION> will expand its trans-Atlantic service 30% beginning next year with six new daily flights between the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, officials announced yesterday. 
The new nonstop flights, starting next May, will include Chicago-Warsaw, <ORGANIZATION>Chicago-Helsinki</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Miami-Madrid</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Dallas-Barcelona</ORGANIZATION>, a second daily <ORGANIZATION>Chicago-Paris</ORGANIZATION> flight and a second daily <ORGANIZATION>Chicago-Manchester</ORGANIZATION> flight, the officials said. 
<LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> has the largest population of citizens of Polish heritage in any city outside <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>. 
The additions solidify <LOCATION>American</LOCATION>'s position as the third-largest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> transatlantic carrier, behind <ORGANIZATION>PanAm Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Pan American World Airways</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Trans World Airlines</ORGANIZATION>. 
The fibers business, whose products go into textiles, carpeting and myriad industrial uses, now accounts for only 20% of <ORGANIZATION>Akzo</ORGANIZATION>'s sales. "We have definitely become less cyclical," <PERSON>Syb Bergsma</PERSON>, executive vice president-finance, said in an interview. 
Still, <PERSON>Akzo</PERSON> hasn't yet found a way to achieve another goal: a large presence in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market for prescription drugs.
<PERSON>Mr. Bergsma</PERSON> said prices for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> pharmaceutical companies remain too high, making it unlikely that <ORGANIZATION>Akzo</ORGANIZATION> will pursue any major acquisitions in that area.
"Maybe Akzo can surprise the investment world a bit," said <PERSON>Jaap Visker</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV</ORGANIZATION>.
At <ORGANIZATION>James Capel & Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, analyst <PERSON>Jackie Ashurst</PERSON> notes that <PERSON>Akzo</PERSON> is less exposed than many of its rivals to the most volatile chemical products.
Although bulk-chemical prices have begun falling in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, they are generally stable in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Bergsma</PERSON> said.
But <PERSON>Akzo</PERSON> is still slimming down: It recently announced plans to eliminate about 1,700 fiber-related jobs in the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>. 
Akzo's Twaron aramid fiber is a distant second to <ORGANIZATION>Du Pont Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Kevlar</ORGANIZATION>, which dominates the market.
In August, for example, it completed the $110 million acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Reliance Universal Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> maker of industrial coatings for wood, metals and plastics, from <ORGANIZATION>Tyler Corp</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Bergsma</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Akzo</LOCATION> is likely to see strong profit growth from coatings as it realizes cost savings and other benefits from its greater scale. 
For <PERSON>Akzo</PERSON>'s drug business, where profits have shown litle change for the past five years, <PERSON>Mr. Bergsma</PERSON> predicted moderate profit growth.
Akzo is the leading seller of birth-control pills in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> but is still seeking regulatory approvals to enter that market in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Bergsma</PERSON> said Akzo hopes to have approval to sell its <ORGANIZATION>Marvelon</ORGANIZATION> pill in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in 1992. 
A state trial judge in <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> gave preliminary approval to a proposed settlement of a suit against a <ORGANIZATION>Bank of New York Co.</ORGANIZATION> unit, <ORGANIZATION>Irving Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION>, over the interest rates on <PERSON>Irving</PERSON>'s former One Wall Street Account money-market deposit accounts. 
<PERSON>Judge Albert Green</PERSON>, in <ORGANIZATION>Cook County Circuit Court</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, also recognized the suit, filed last May by <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> and <PERSON>Cynthia Langendorf</PERSON>, as a class action covering thousands of Irving customers.
A <ORGANIZATION>Bank of New York</ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Owen Brady</PERSON>, said, "That's the maximum, outside figure." 
<ORGANIZATION>Centerior Energy Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION>Ohio Water Development Authority</ORGANIZATION> approved terms for two series of tax-exempt bonds to finance a water-pollution control and solid-waste disposal facilities. 
Proceeds of the sale will go to <ORGANIZATION>Centerior</ORGANIZATION>'s operating subsidiaries to finance the projects, located at a nuclear unit located near <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>. 
"There's a distinct possibility that I may lose my job over this," the employee, <PERSON>Karen Allen</PERSON>, of Floor Covering Resources, <LOCATION>Kensington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, recently told a congressional hearing.
The <ORGANIZATION>House Energy and Commerce Committee</ORGANIZATION>'s health subcommittee, headed by Democratic Rep. <PERSON>Henry Waxman</PERSON> of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, is looking into complaints that small businesses not only can't keep reasonably priced employee-health insurance if claims are filed, but often can't get coverage at all if a worker is termed medically uninsurable. 
"Insurance companies will offer a good rate if no one is sick, but it's a roll of the dice," says <PERSON>Rosemary Heinhold</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Small Business Service Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, a group representing 35,000 small businesses nationwide. "One case of cancer or a high-risk pregnancy with a sick infant, and rates go up 40% to 60%.
"I'm not accusing insurers of dereliction of duty," <PERSON>Robert Patricelli</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION> told <PERSON>Mr. Waxman</PERSON>'s panel. "You can't ask one carrier to underwrite on social grounds when that might destroy it in the marketplace." 
Rep. <PERSON>Waxman</PERSON> and Democratic <PERSON>Sen. Edward Kennedy</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> have proposed regulation to deal with the problem.
"Before the state of <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> mandated that mental-health care be covered, there were only 70 mental-health clinics in the state; now there are 400," says <PERSON>Carolyn Miller</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>NFIB</ORGANIZATION> lobbyist.
She contends that similar mandates have driven up insurance costs 20% in <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> and 30% in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. 
The insurance-industry association also strongly disagrees with the proposed community rating, which "doesn't save one dollar," argues <PERSON>James Dorsch</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>HIAA</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> counsel. "It just makes healthy businesses subsidize unhealthy ones and gives each employer less incentive to keep his workers healthy." <PERSON>Mr. Dorsch</PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION>HIAA</ORGANIZATION> is working on a proposal to establish a privately funded reinsurance mechanism to help cover small groups that can't get insurance without excluding certain employees. 
The 47-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Nicastro</PERSON> joins <ORGANIZATION>Grand Union</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Singer Co.</LOCATION>, where he was treasurer. 
(<LOCATION>Jacksonville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>) -- <PERSON>Charles Bates</PERSON>, president, chief executive and chief operating officer will resign from these positions and the board effective Oct. 31. 
In the second step of a reorganization that began earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION>Boeing Co.</ORGANIZATION> said it will create a <ORGANIZATION>Defense and Space Group</ORGANIZATION> to consolidate several divisions. 
Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> officials and representatives of the <ORGANIZATION>Machinists</ORGANIZATION> union met separately last night with a federal mediator in an attempt to break the month-old strike that has shut the aerospace giant's assembly lines at a time when it has an $80 billion backlog of jetliner orders.
While <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION>'s commercial business is booming, its military business is feeling the effects of a declining defense budget after a strong buildup during the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> presidency.
In May, the company consolidated its <ORGANIZATION>Aerospace and Electronics</ORGANIZATION> groups; the new <ORGANIZATION>Defense and Space Group</ORGANIZATION> will contain the <ORGANIZATION>Aerospace and Electronics</ORGANIZATION> division and <ORGANIZATION>Advanced Systems</ORGANIZATION>, both based in the <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> area; <ORGANIZATION>Boeing Helicopters</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Boeing Military Airplanes</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Wichita</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kan.</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>ArgoSystems</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Sunnyvale</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>B. Dan Pinick</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Boeing Aerospace and Electronics</ORGANIZATION>, will become president of the new group, which will become operational Jan. 2. 
In addition, <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> said it also will reorganize all its work in <LOCATION>Wichita</LOCATION> into military and commercial divisions.
Analysts agreed. "It's a further step to better returns in the hemorrhaging defense business," said <PERSON>Steven Binder</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Bear, Stearns & Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. "They had to do it." 
<PERSON>Howard Rubel</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>C.J. Lawrence</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Grenfell Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said the shift reflects <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> confidence in <PERSON>Mr. Pinick</PERSON>, described by <PERSON>Mr. Rubel</PERSON> as an expert on doing business with the military. "His side of the business has been successful in a tough environment," <PERSON>Mr. Rubel</PERSON> said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Nashua Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, rumored a potential takeover target for six months, said that a <LOCATION>Dutch</LOCATION> company has sought <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> approval to buy up to 25% of <ORGANIZATION>Nashua</ORGANIZATION>'s shares. 
<LOCATION>Nashua</LOCATION>, whose major business is selling copiers, facsimile machines and related supplies, said <ORGANIZATION>Reiss & Co</ORGANIZATION>. B.V. of the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION> filed a request with the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Trade Commission</ORGANIZATION> under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act for permission to buy more than $15 million of <ORGANIZATION>Nashua</ORGANIZATION>'s stock but less than 25%. 
Previously, an affiliate of <ORGANIZATION>Unicorp Canada</ORGANIZATION> disclosed a stake of less than 5% in <LOCATION>Nashua</LOCATION>, according to <PERSON>Daniel M. Junius</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Nashua</LOCATION>'s treasurer. 
<PERSON>Mr. Junius</PERSON> said <PERSON>Nashua</PERSON>'s "intention is to remain an independent public company." The company said it amended its shareholder rights plan by reducing to 10% from 20% the level of ownership by an outsider that would trigger the issuance to other holders of rights to buy additional shares of <LOCATION>Nashua</LOCATION> common at half price. 
<PERSON>Alex Henderson</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities</ORGANIZATION>, said that while <LOCATION>Nashua</LOCATION>'s performance this year has been "atrocious," the company nonetheless is attractive as a "classic breakup candidate because there's no similarity between its {four} businesses." He estimated the breakup value at $55 a share.
In addition to selling Japanese-made photocopiers and facsimile machines in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and copier supplies in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nashua</LOCATION> has three other major businesses: labels and tapes, data storage disks for computers and mail-order photofinishing. 
Perhaps it's entertaining for those like you to discount the concerns of environmentalists, suggesting that their save-the-earth initiatives are "whacky" and referring to so many citizens as "la-la activists." Strange that we don't hear similar criticisms of the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> activists who seek to clean up <LOCATION>Boston Harbor</LOCATION> or rid their beaches of medical waste. 
I realize you were just looking for something snotty to say about <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and its environmental movement, but picking <PERSON>Frank Lloyd Wright</PERSON> to say it for you was a bad call.
As for <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> being a state run by liberal environmental loonies, let's not forget where <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> came from.
Perhaps <PERSON>Mr. Reagan</PERSON>, who claimed that air pollution is caused by trees, is the man you should be quoting to back up your position that economics is more important than the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
Your editorial was commendable and neatly matched by the readers' comments in letters to the editor, "Alar: Scaring on the Side of Caution." The illogic and inaccuracy of <PERSON>John H. Adams</PERSON>'s comments for the <ORGANIZATION>National Resources Defense Council</ORGANIZATION> fully justifies your characterization of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s Greens in particular as "la-la activists." We may all hope that <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s voters will heed the scientific realities that their own university's renowned Prof.
<PERSON>Tom Jukes</PERSON> provides them and ignore the charlatanry profferred by their "wealthy <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> weepers." 
<LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va</LOCATION>. 
According to the association's annual report, scheduled to be released today in <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>IATA</ORGANIZATION> members haven't posted such a strong performance since the late 1970s.
The <ORGANIZATION>KGB</ORGANIZATION> has abolished a unit known for persecuting dissidents, the government newspaper <LOCATION>Izvestia</LOCATION> said.
The newspaper quoted <ORGANIZATION>KGB</ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON>Vladimir A. Kryuchkov</PERSON> as saying the definition of anti-Soviet crimes had narrowed, the laws had changed and people no longer have to fear a simple slip of the tongue.
<PERSON>Mr. Kryuchkov</PERSON> was quoted as saying that in place of the infamous 5th <ORGANIZATION>Directorate</ORGANIZATION> a new unit would work "to foil the conspiracies of foreign intelligence services to create and use organized anti-government groups in our country." 
<LOCATION>Czechoslovakia</LOCATION> has restricted consumer-goods exports to neighbor countries because of "massive buying out of food" by tourists from <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Rude Pravo</LOCATION> daily said.
Rising inflation in <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> makes Czechoslovak food, clothing and shoes relatively cheap for visitors from these countries.
<LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>'s biggest union, <ORGANIZATION>IG Metall</ORGANIZATION>, said it is ready to back demands for more pay and shorter hours with strikes against the nation's automotive, steel and engineering industries.
Now comes word from a scientist that over the next century <ORGANIZATION>Venice</ORGANIZATION> will sink nearly three times faster than the present rate because of the "greenhouse effect." "Global warming means higher tides which will lower <ORGANIZATION>Venice</ORGANIZATION> by another 23 inches in the next 100 years," <PERSON>Giovanni Cecconi</PERSON> of the the <ORGANIZATION>New Venice Consortium</ORGANIZATION> said.
<LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Quelle</ORGANIZATION> said it will establish a mail-order operation with two local partners in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> next year.
Saying this is a first for a Western company, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>'s largest mail-order group said the newly established Moscow-based <ORGANIZATION>Intermoda</ORGANIZATION> company is scheduled to begin operations in February 1990.
<ORGANIZATION>Intermoda</ORGANIZATION> will initially only send the textile and clothing section of the <LOCATION>Quelle</LOCATION> catalog, translated into <LOCATION>Russian</LOCATION>, to Soviet customers who have access to convertible currency. 
The <ORGANIZATION>European Community Commission</ORGANIZATION> has imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of <LOCATION>South Korean</LOCATION> small-screen color-television sets. 
Saying that a surge in low-priced imports had damaged <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> producers' profits and led to job losses, the commission imposed a duty of 10.2% on TVs made by <ORGANIZATION>Daewoo</ORGANIZATION>, a duty of 12.3% on <ORGANIZATION>Goldstar Co.</ORGANIZATION>, 13% on <ORGANIZATION>Samsung</ORGANIZATION> and 19.6% on TVs made by other <LOCATION>South Korean</LOCATION> producers. 
In other news concerning <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>'s television industry, <ORGANIZATION>Samsung</ORGANIZATION> signed an agreement with <PERSON>Soyuz</PERSON>, the external-trade organization of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, to swap <LOCATION>Korean</LOCATION> television sets and videocassette recorders for pig iron from the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> have no diplomatic relations but exchanged trade offices earlier this year. 
<LOCATION>Sri Lanka</LOCATION>, where more than 15,000 people have died in six years of ethnic turmoil, said it will ban sex and violence from state-owned television next year. "Many programs we have now come from the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> and are not suitable to our culture," a government minister said.
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading Friday, <ORGANIZATION>Automatic Data</ORGANIZATION> closed at $46.50 a share, down $2.25. 
While admitting such a move would be "devastating" to most creditors, <PERSON>Judge Abramson</PERSON> told a courtroom filled with nearly two dozen attorneys that he was concerned about the toll mounting legal bills will take on <PERSON>Mr. Hunt</PERSON>'s shrinking estate and about the fact that, following voting by creditors, none of the reorganization plans appeared to be viable in their present form. 
Despite his reluctance to take the latter step, the judge indicated he would move quickly after hearing testimony later this week in the bitter dispute between <ORGANIZATION>Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Minpeco S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, a minerals concern owned by the Peruvian governmemt. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Manufacturers Hanover Corp.</ORGANIZATION> unit, which is seeking repayment of a $36 million loan, has asked the court to give its claim priority over that of <ORGANIZATION>Minpeco</ORGANIZATION>, which won a $132 million judgment against <PERSON>Mr. Hunt</PERSON>, his brother <PERSON>Nelson Bunker Hunt</PERSON> and other defendants last year in a case stemming from their alleged attempts to corner the silver market in 
But even that is disputed by <ORGANIZATION>Manufacturers Hanover</ORGANIZATION> which, in alliance with the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>, contends that <ORGANIZATION>Minpeco</ORGANIZATION> has already collected more than its actual damages from other defendants in the silver-conspiracy case. 
Under prodding from <PERSON>Judge Abramson</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Minpeco</ORGANIZATION> executive flew in from <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> last week to talk directly with executives from Manufacturers <PERSON>Hanover</PERSON> on a settlement.
Despite long private sessions in both <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, the two sides ended the week "6,000 miles and many dollars apart," according to attorney <PERSON>Hugh Ray</PERSON>, who represents <ORGANIZATION>Manufacturers Hanover</ORGANIZATION>.
All three major creditors -- the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Minpeco</ORGANIZATION> and Manufacturers Hanover -- voted against and effectively doomed a reorganization plan proposed by <PERSON>Mr. Hunt</PERSON>.
A reorganization plan proposed jointly by the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Manufacturers Hanover</ORGANIZATION> was stalled by a negative vote from <LOCATION>Minpeco</LOCATION>.
The mineral concern's own reorganization plan met a similar fate after opposition from the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Manufacturers Hanover</ORGANIZATION>.
Meanwhile, settlement negotiations continue between <PERSON>Mr. Hunt</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>, which has already reached a tentative agreement with <PERSON>Nelson Bunker Hunt</PERSON>.
<ORGANIZATION>Rand Corp.</ORGANIZATION> researchers <PERSON>Linda Waite</PERSON> and <PERSON>Frances Goldscheider</PERSON> analyzed a large sample of married women with at least one child at home between the ages of six and 18.
But separate reports from <PERSON>Joshua Weiner</PERSON> and <PERSON>Denise Spence</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Brookings Institution</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Korbin Liu</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Urban Institute</ORGANIZATION> find that "a surprisingly small proportion" -- only about 10% -- of residents start out as private payers but "spend down" to Medicaid levels in a single nursing home stay before they die or are discharged. (Another one-third are already on Medicaid when they enter the nursing homes, a considerably higher proportion than the analysts anticipated.) 
About one-third pay out of their own pockets, while the rest are covered throughout by <ORGANIZATION>Medicare</ORGANIZATION>, private insurers or the <ORGANIZATION>Veterans Administration</ORGANIZATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Brookings</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Urban Institute</ORGANIZATION> authors caution, however, that most nursing home stays are of comparatively short duration, and reaching the Medicaid level is more likely with an unusually long stay or repeated stays.
SEPARATED and divorced men and women are far more likely to be smokers than married persons, the <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> discovers. . . . Graduate students are taking longer than ever to get their doctor of philosophy degrees, the <ORGANIZATION>National Research Council</ORGANIZATION> says.
<ORGANIZATION>Ratners Group PLC</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> subsidiary has agreed to acquire jewelry retailer <ORGANIZATION>Weisfield's Inc.</ORGANIZATION> for $50 a share, or about $55 million. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ratners</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Weisfield</ORGANIZATION>'s said they reached an agreement in principle for the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Weisfield</ORGANIZATION>'s by <ORGANIZATION>Sterling Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Weisfield</ORGANIZATION>'s, based in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, currently operates 87 specialty jewelry stores in nine states.
<ORGANIZATION>Ratners</ORGANIZATION>, which controls 25% of the British jewelry market, would increase the number of its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stores to about 450 stores from 360.
Some <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration officials urged <PERSON>Mr. Greenspan</PERSON> to make an immediate public announcement of his plans to provide ample credit to the markets.
<PERSON>Mr. Greenspan</PERSON>'s decision to keep quiet also prompted a near-mutiny within the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>'s ranks.
A "senior <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> official" spoke on Saturday after the market swoon to both the <ORGANIZATION>Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION>, saying the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> was prepared to provide as much credit as the markets needed.
The statement angered Chairman <PERSON>Greenspan</PERSON>, but it was greeted with applause by the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration and the financial markets.
And, while the mutinous <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> member hasn't gone public, some <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> governors, most notably Vice Chairman <PERSON>Manuel Johnson</PERSON>, are known to have disagreed with the chairman's decision to remain silent.
At a hearing last week, Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd of <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> told <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Nicholas Brady</PERSON> that "Chairman <PERSON>Greenspan</PERSON>'s" announcement over the Oct. 13 weekend was a "very important statement." <PERSON>Mr. Brady</PERSON> hesitantly replied that he wasn't sure whether <PERSON>Mr. Greenspan</PERSON> "made a statement himself, or whether that was a newspaper report." 
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration officials appear increasingly concerned that <PERSON>Mr. Greenspan</PERSON> is cautious to a fault.
But <PERSON>Mr. Greenspan</PERSON> remains reluctant to loosen policy, partly because he faces a phalanx of presidents of regional <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> banks who oppose credit easing.
But if the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> eases too soon, <PERSON>Mr. Greenspan</PERSON> fears, prices may begin to accelerate again next year.
Moreover, if the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> holds tight, it may be able gradually to reduce inflation, moving toward the zero-inflation goal that the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> chairman embraced in testimony to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> last week. 
His hand on the monetary tiller seems one reason why the economy next month seems highly likely to begin an unprecedented eighth year of peacetime growth without a recession. "We've gotten through two stock market crashes, and we've gone through an election without any major problems," says <PERSON>David Hale</PERSON>, an economist of <ORGANIZATION>Kemper Financial Services</ORGANIZATION>. "I think you have to give <PERSON>Greenspan</PERSON> a good rating." 
Already, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> is toying with legislation to curb the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>'s independence.
<PERSON>Mr. Perry</PERSON>, who runs <ORGANIZATION>Unilever Group</ORGANIZATION>'s world-wide personal-care business, paused to scan the crowd. "I see we have about half the audience working for us," he said, tongue in cheek. "The other half, we may have before long." 
First Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch packaged-goods giant, spent $2 billion to acquire brands such as <PERSON>Faberge</PERSON> and <PERSON>Elizabeth Arden</PERSON>.
Then <ORGANIZATION>Procter & Gamble Co.</ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION>Noxell Corp.</ORGANIZATION> for $1.3 billion.
<ORGANIZATION>Estee Lauder Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Revlon Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and other cosmetics houses traditionally have considered themselves fashion enterprises whose product development is guided by the creative intuition of their executives.
"Just because upscale cosmetics look like packaged goods and smell like packaged goods, it doesn't mean they are packaged goods," says <PERSON>Leonard Lauder</PERSON>, chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Estee Lauder</ORGANIZATION>. "They're really fashion items wrapped up in little jars." 
In contrast to the more artistic nature of traditional cosmetics houses, <ORGANIZATION>Unilever</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>P&G</ORGANIZATION> are the habitats of organization men in gray-flannel suits.
Consider Oil of Olay, which <ORGANIZATION>P&G</ORGANIZATION> acquired as part of <ORGANIZATION>Richardson-Vicks International</ORGANIZATION> in 1985.
The moisturizer, introduced in 1962, had a dowdy image. "Oil of Olay brought with it the baggage of being used basically by older women who had already aged," says <PERSON>David Williams</PERSON>, a consultant with <ORGANIZATION>New England Consulting Group</ORGANIZATION>. 
Goliaths like <ORGANIZATION>Unilever</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>P&G</ORGANIZATION> have enormous financial advantages over smaller rivals.
Next year, <ORGANIZATION>Noxell</ORGANIZATION> plans to roll out a perfume called <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>, says <PERSON>George L. Bunting Jr.</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Noxell</ORGANIZATION>.
Without <ORGANIZATION>P&G</ORGANIZATION>'s backing, <PERSON>Noxell</PERSON> might not have been able to spend the estimated $5 million to $7 million needed to accomplish that without scrimping on its existing brands.
Rumors that <ORGANIZATION>Unilever</ORGANIZATION> is interested in acquiring <ORGANIZATION>Schering-Plough Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Maybelline</ORGANIZATION> unit are widespread.
<PERSON>Estee Lauder</PERSON>, for example, spends only an estimated 5% of sales on advertising in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Mr. Lauder</PERSON> says he has no plans to change his strategy. 
Nearly 70% of cosmetics sales come through mass-distribution outlets such as drug stores and supermarkets, according to <PERSON>Andrew Shore</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
This fall, for example, <ORGANIZATION>L'Oreal Group</ORGANIZATION>, ordinarily a high-end line, rolled out a drug-store line of skin-care products called <ORGANIZATION>Plenitude</ORGANIZATION>, which retail for $5 to $15. 
That's led industry executives to speculate that future product development will be driven more by technological innovation than by fashion whims -- especially among mass-market brands. "There will be more emphasis on quality," says <PERSON>Guy Peyrelongue</PERSON>, chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Cosmair Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> licensee of <LOCATION>L'Oreal</LOCATION>. "You'll see fewer gimmicks." 
But success for <ORGANIZATION>Unilever</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>P&G</ORGANIZATION> is far from guaranteed, as shown by the many consumer-product companies that have tried and failed to master the quirky beauty business.
In the 1970s, several pharmaceutical and packaged-goods companies, including <ORGANIZATION>Colgate-Palmolive Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Eli Lilly & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Pfizer Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Schering-Plough</ORGANIZATION> acquired cosmetics companies.
The mass-market <LOCATION>Aziza</LOCATION> brand, which it acquired in 1987 along with <ORGANIZATION>Chesebrough-Pond's Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, has lost share, according to industry analysts. 
<ORGANIZATION>Society Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which is also a bank, agreed in June to buy <ORGANIZATION>Trustcorp</ORGANIZATION> for 12.4 million shares of stock with a market value of about $450 million.
At the same time, personal income was held down by the effects of Hurricane Hugo, which tore through parts of <LOCATION>North</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> in late September.
"I think the consumer has pretty well played himself out," said <PERSON>David Littman</PERSON>, senior economist at <ORGANIZATION>Manufacturers National Bank of Detroit</ORGANIZATION>. 
British-born, the 24-year <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy</ORGANIZATION> veteran was named last week to succeed <PERSON>Kenneth Roman</PERSON>, who is leaving by year's end to take a top post at <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>, an <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy</ORGANIZATION> client.
He also plans to get to know clients that <PERSON>Mr. Roman</PERSON> was closer to, such as <ORGANIZATION>Lever Brothers</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Seagram</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Phillips</PERSON> also hopes to finally implement a reorganization announced earlier this year but put on hold by the <ORGANIZATION>WPP</ORGANIZATION> takeover.
Under the reorganization, <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy</ORGANIZATION> plans to name one executive on each account as a "client service director" to work as the client's single contact for all those services. "There is little or no integration of our work, quality is spotty, there is no single focus," <PERSON>Mr. Phillips</PERSON> complained to staffers in March, when the reorganization was announced.
Now <PERSON>Mr. Phillips</PERSON> says he hopes to have the new system in place for several clients -- including <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>American Telephone & Telegraph</ORGANIZATION> and Ryder -- by year's end. 
And while last week the agency hired a top Chiat/Day/Mojo executive, <PERSON>Bill Hamilton</PERSON>, to try to bolster its work, "<PERSON>Graham</PERSON> has to get the revenue of that <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> office moving," says <PERSON>James Dougherty</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>County NatWest Securities</ORGANIZATION>. 
As <PERSON>Mr. Dougherty</PERSON> says, "The last thing they need is enormous disruption at the top . . . and <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> is obviously a long-term member of the <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy Mafia</ORGANIZATION>, as we call it." 
<PERSON>Mr. Phillips</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Roman</PERSON> are indeed quite similar in substance, if not in style.
While <PERSON>Mr. Roman</PERSON> is a workaholic detailsman, <PERSON>Mr. Phillips</PERSON> would rather delegate, leaving him time for his interests outside the office.
<PERSON>Mr. Roman</PERSON>, by contrast, seems rarely to cut loose at all, although he did appear at <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Halloween</ORGANIZATION> party Friday decked out in duck feet and a duck hat, costumed as a "lame duck." 
<PERSON>Mr. Phillips</PERSON> said the company's expected margin improvement will be all but inevitable, given that the company's profitability was dragged down this year by an expensive move to luxurious, oversized new <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> headquarters.
<ORGANIZATION>WPP</ORGANIZATION>, which assumes financial control of its businesses in a hands-on way, instituted a new financial system and plans to sublet some floors in <LOCATION>Ogilvy</LOCATION>'s new headquarters building to outsiders.
In an internal memo, <PERSON>Alex Kroll</PERSON>, the agency's chairman, said <PERSON>Mr. Klein</PERSON> decided to remove himself to minimize "negative reaction" from prospective clients and others and to prepare for his defense. "The fact that he is in the process of defending himself against the present charges could conceivably have an adverse impact on Y&R," <PERSON>Mr. Kroll</PERSON> wrote.
<PERSON>Mr. Klein</PERSON> will work with <PERSON>Mr. Kroll</PERSON> on some of the agency's joint venture activities and acquisitions while the case is pending.
<PERSON>Peter Georgescu</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Y&R</ORGANIZATION>'s ad operations, will assume <PERSON>Mr. Klein</PERSON>'s day-to-day role. 
<PERSON>Ms. Heller</PERSON>, 38, had headed up <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> agency Heller/Breene, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>WCRS</ORGANIZATION>.
The agency, with about $35 million in billings, will be dissolved, with some of its staffers absorbed by <ORGANIZATION>WCRS</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Della Femina McNamee</ORGANIZATION> unit in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Ms. Heller</PERSON> said.
At <LOCATION>Wells Rich</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Ms. Heller</PERSON> will concentrate on accounts that include <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Benson & Hedges</ORGANIZATION> cigarette brand, which relies on print ads, <PERSON>Ms. Heller</PERSON>'s specialty.
As previously reported, the account is troubled, with <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris</ORGANIZATION> asking <PERSON>Backer Spielvogel Bates</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy & Mather</ORGANIZATION>, and possibly others to try their hand at developing new creative work.
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> shares were depressed initially by overnight losses in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and by the drop in sterling after <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>'s resignation.
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> stocks recovered some of their losses after the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> market closed. 
<ORGANIZATION>The Financial Times</ORGANIZATION> 100-share index shed 47.3 points to close at 2082.1, down 4.5% from the previous Friday and 6.8% from Oct. 13, when Wall Street's plunge helped spark the current weakness in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. 
But they said Friday's focus on the top-tier stocks telegraphed active overseas selling and showed the broad-based fears over the status of the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> economy and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s currency in the wake of the upheaval in Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON>'s cabinet. 
A senior dealer with <ORGANIZATION>Warburg Securities</ORGANIZATION> noted British Gas, the most active blue-chip stock at 20 million shares traded, was affected by the political implications of <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>'s departure and <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>'s cabinet shuffle. 
He attributed the unusually high volume to broad-based selling on fears that the Thatcher government may be in turmoil and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Labor Party</ORGANIZATION> positioned to regain control of the government and renew efforts at nationalization. 
Other dealers added that the blue-chip stocks in general were hit by profit-taking over concerns that <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> shares will continue posting declines and the uncertainty over sterling given that <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>'s successor, <PERSON>John Major</PERSON>, had only been in the job one day. 
Among the other actively traded blue-chip issues, <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Chemical Industries</ORGANIZATION> dropped 11 to #10.86, <PERSON>Hanson</PERSON> skidded 9.5 to 200.5, and <ORGANIZATION>British Telecom</ORGANIZATION> fell 10 to 250. 
In early trading in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Monday, the <ORGANIZATION>Nikkei</ORGANIZATION> index fell 148.85 points to 35378.44. 
An official at <ORGANIZATION>Wako Securities</ORGANIZATION> said brokerages' excessive expectations about recent advances in <ORGANIZATION>Tokyu Group</ORGANIZATION> shares and real estate issues were dashed Friday. 
Traders said the continued turbulence in other markets, coupled with the drop in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> following the <LOCATION>Lawson</LOCATION> resignation, were responsible. 
"It's the whole uncertainty about what's happening around us," said <PERSON>Valentin Von Korff</PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION>Credit Suisse First Boston</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>. "If you take away the outside influences, the market itself looks very cheap.
Elsewhere, share prices closed lower in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>, and were mixed in <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION>.
Share prices also closed lower in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>.
Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Kellwood</PERSON> said <PERSON>Gabriel Hakim Sr.</PERSON>, president of <LOCATION>Crowntuft</LOCATION>, will continue to head <ORGANIZATION>Crowntuft</ORGANIZATION>'s management group. 
<ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> offered to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Great Northern Nekoosa Corp.</ORGANIZATION> for $58 a share, or about $3.18 billion. 
The offer capped a week of rumors that <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, an Atlanta-based forest-products company, was considering making a bid for <ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION>, a paper-products concern based in <LOCATION>Norwalk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn</LOCATION>. 
Executives at <ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION> couldn't be reached, and officials at <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Pacific</ORGANIZATION> declined to comment.
<ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION> closed yesterday at $42.75, up $2.75, in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading. 
The bid for <ORGANIZATION>Great Northern</ORGANIZATION>, a notice of which appears in an advertisement in today's Wall Street Journal, is the first big takeover offer since the collapse of a $6.79 billion buy-out of <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Oct. 13. 
While <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s stock has outperformed the market in the past two years, <ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION> has lagged the market in the same period. 
According to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report, options trading in <ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION> was also heavy, ranking only behind <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> in volume on the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Board Options Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 
According to the <ORGANIZATION>Value Line Investment Survey</ORGANIZATION>, demand for <ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION>'s commodity paper has weakened, prompting earnings to decline by 6.6% in the third quarter ended Sept. 30.
By contrast, <ORGANIZATION>Value Line</ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> "is in a comparatively good position to deal with weakening paper markets," because its production is concentrated not in the <LOCATION>Northwest</LOCATION> but in the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION>, where it should be able to avoid some of the cost pressures from rising wood-chip prices.
The purchase of <ORGANIZATION>Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION> would easily eclipse <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s $530 million acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Brunswick Pulp & Paper Co.</ORGANIZATION> last year.
Here, at a soccer stadium near the black township of <LOCATION>Soweto</LOCATION> yesterday, were eight leaders of the <ORGANIZATION>African National Congress</ORGANIZATION>, seven of whom had spent most of their adult lives in prison for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government.
Here were more than 70,000 <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> supporters, gathering for the first <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> rally inside <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> since the black liberation movement was banned in 1960.
But the words that boomed over the loudspeakers bore messages of peace, unity, negotiation and discipline. "We stand for peace today and we will stand for peace tomorrow," said <PERSON>Walter Sisulu</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION>'s former secretary general who, along with five of his colleagues, served 26 years in prison before being released two weeks ago.
<LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION> releases the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> leaders, most of whom were serving life sentences, and allows them to speak freely, hoping that the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> will abandon its use of violence.
The <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> leaders speak in tones of moderation, emphasizing discipline, hoping the government will be encouraged to take further steps, such as freeing <PERSON>Nelson Mandela</PERSON>, the most prominent <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> figure, and unbanning the organization. 
In a message read out at the rally, exiled <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Oliver Tambo</PERSON>, who can't legally be quoted in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, said the country was at a crossroads and that <PERSON>Mr. de Klerk</PERSON> "may yet earn a place among the peacemakers of our country" if he chooses a "path of genuine political settlement." 
For instance, it releases <PERSON>Mr. Sisulu</PERSON> without conditions, yet his son, <PERSON>Zwelakhe</PERSON>, a newspaper editor, is restricted to his home much of the day and isn't allowed to work as a journalist. 
Speakers yesterday called on foreign governments to increase sanctions against <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION> and urged supporters inside the country to continue defying emergency restrictions and racial segregation, known as apartheid. "We cannot wait on the government to make changes at its own pace," <PERSON>Mr. Sisulu</PERSON> said. 
Because the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> remains banned, both the government, which approved the rally, and the organizers, who orchestrated it, denied it was an <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> rally.
Nevertheless, an <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> rally by any other name is still an <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> rally. 
Behind them was a huge <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> flag and an even bigger sign that said "<ORGANIZATION>ANC Lives</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> Leads." Next to them was the red flag of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION>South African Communist Party</ORGANIZATION>, which has long been an <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> ally.
In the stands, people waved <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> flags, wore <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> T-shirts, sang <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> songs and chanted <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> slogans. 
"Today," said <PERSON>Mr. Sisulu</PERSON>, "the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> has captured the center stage of political life in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>." 
As a police helicopter circled overhead, <PERSON>Mr. Sisulu</PERSON> repeated the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION>'s demands on the government to create a climate for negotiations: Release all political prisoners unconditionally; lift all bans and restrictions on individuals and organizations; remove all troops from the black townships; end the state of emergency, and cease all political trials and political executions.
Echoing a phrase from <PERSON>Mr. de Klerk</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Sisulu</PERSON> said, "Let all of us who love this country engage in the task of building a new <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>." 
<PERSON>Mr. Jordan</PERSON>, formerly president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Fishkill National Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Beacon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, succeeds <PERSON>Donald Broderick</PERSON>, who died at 52 in an automobile accident. 
<ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas Corp.</ORGANIZATION> received contracts totaling $244.8 million for 72 F-A-18 aircraft for the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> and helicopter spare parts for the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Aerojet General Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>GenCorp Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, was awarded a $40.1 million
<ORGANIZATION>Rockwell International Corp.</ORGANIZATION> received a $26.7 million <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> contract for submarine ballistic missiles. 
<ORGANIZATION>Honeywell Inc.</ORGANIZATION> got a $22.3 million <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> contract for aircraft missile warning sets. 
<ORGANIZATION>Beech Aircraft Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Raytheon Co.</ORGANIZATION>, received an $11.5 million <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> contract for C-12 aircraft support. 
His latest coup: September's masterminding of the five billion Swiss-franc ($3.07 billion) merger between <LOCATION>Adia S.A.</LOCATION>, the world's second-largest temporary employment agency, and <ORGANIZATION>Inspectorate International S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, a Rey-controlled product-inspection company. 
But approval is almost certain since <PERSON>Mr. Rey</PERSON> and a friendly <ORGANIZATION>Adia</ORGANIZATION> management are in control. 
After the transaction, <PERSON>Mr. Rey</PERSON> estimates the value of his 20% stake in the new company, to be held by his <ORGANIZATION>Omni Holding AG</ORGANIZATION>, will be about 1 billion <LOCATION>Swiss</LOCATION> francs.
<PERSON>Mr. Rey</PERSON> bought a controlling stake in Inspectorate for 18 million Swiss francs in 1982, building up the little-known engineering company with <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> acquisitions. 
Zurich-based magazine <LOCATION>Bilanz</LOCATION> lists <PERSON>Mr. Rey</PERSON> as having a fortune of about 1.5 billion Swiss francs.
For <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>'s most prestigious newspaper, <PERSON>Neue Zuercher Zeitung</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Rey</PERSON> seems destined to remain the "former Bally raider," an image that has proved hard to overcome. 
In 1976, as an upstart in the eyes of <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>'s establishment, <PERSON>Mr. Rey</PERSON> laid the foundations of his present-day prominence with an unheard-of raid on Bally, the country's traditional shoemaker. 
Sitting beside a banker at a luncheon in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, where he was working as a financial consultant, he learned that a large packet of <ORGANIZATION>Bally</ORGANIZATION>'s shares was up for sale.
Looking into <LOCATION>Bally</LOCATION>, he could hardly believe what he saw: a company with enormous real-estate holdings in major <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> cities and a market capitalization of 28 million Swiss francs; it had 7,000 employees. 
Investing four million Swiss francs earned from his financial transactions and two million Swiss francs from his parents and his wife, <PERSON>Mr. Rey</PERSON> acquired 20% of <ORGANIZATION>Bally</ORGANIZATION>'s shares. 
Eventually, <PERSON>Mr. Rey</PERSON> was forced to sell his <ORGANIZATION>Bally</ORGANIZATION> shares to the weapons maker <ORGANIZATION>Oerlikon-Buehrle Holding AG</ORGANIZATION> as establishment pressure grew on this hostile move into the Swiss old boys' network. 
In 1979, his career as an industrialist began with the acquisition of the <LOCATION>Swiss</LOCATION> metals works <LOCATION>Selve</LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION>Thun</LOCATION>.
A major boost to <PERSON>Mr. Rey</PERSON>'s respectability among the Swiss came in 1986 when he sold 60% of his <ORGANIZATION>Phibro Bank</ORGANIZATION> to the conservative Swiss cantonal banks.
In 1987, <PERSON>Mr. Rey</PERSON> bested leading publishing houses to take over <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Jean Frey AG</ORGANIZATION>, a major producer of magazines and newspapers. 
And with the recent acquisition of 30% of Winterthur-based machinery manufacturer <ORGANIZATION>Gebrueder Sulzer AG</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Rey</PERSON> has enjoyed the status of white knight.
Meanwhile, as such strategic investments have mounted, the merchant-banking arm of <PERSON>Mr. Rey</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Omni Holding</ORGANIZATION> has been busily buying and selling dozens of companies, often after a financial or corporate restructuring. 
Today, this branch of <PERSON>Mr. Rey</PERSON>'s empire runs under the name <ORGANIZATION>Omnicorp Offering Services</ORGANIZATION> and handles mergers and acquisitions, placement of securities and real estate.
In its portfolio are such diverse companies as <ORGANIZATION>United Kingdom-based Air Europe</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Checkrobot Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> company that makes supermarket checkout machines; <ORGANIZATION>Norment Industries</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> manufacturer of securities systems; <ORGANIZATION>Com Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> regional telephone company; and major real-estate projects in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 
For financial analysts, reading <PERSON>Omni</PERSON>'s accounts is a tough challenge. "Companies move in and out," says <PERSON>Helga Kern</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>KK Swiss Investment</ORGANIZATION>. 
In August, <PERSON>Omni</PERSON> unexpectedly bought <ORGANIZATION>Inspectorate</ORGANIZATION>'s 80% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Harpener AG</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, a land-rich company.
The internal transaction within the Rey empire puzzled <PERSON>Harpener</PERSON>'s small shareholders, but analysts say it makes sense for <ORGANIZATION>Inspectorate-Adia</ORGANIZATION> to focus on its main businesses of product inspection and temporary help. 
<ORGANIZATION>ECI Environmental Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, initial offering of 1.1 million shares, of which <ORGANIZATION>ECI</ORGANIZATION> will sell 990,000 and co-founders will sell 110,000 shares, via <ORGANIZATION>Oppenheimer & Co</ORGANIZATION>.

While lawmakers haven't raised the possibility of renewing military aid to the Contras following <PERSON>Ortega</PERSON>'s weekend threat to end a truce, <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON>Mitchell</PERSON> said on NBC-TV that <PERSON>Ortega</PERSON> had made "a very unwise move." <ORGANIZATION>Minority Leader Dole</ORGANIZATION> plans to offer a resolution tomorrow denouncing the Nicaraguan president, whose remarks came during a celebration in <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> marking regional moves to democracy.

Sales for both years reflect 12-month performances for each year of <PERSON>I. Magnin</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Bullock</ORGANIZATION>'s, and <ORGANIZATION>Bullocks Wilshire</ORGANIZATION>.
As of Feb. 1, 1990, the <ORGANIZATION>Bullocks Wilshire</ORGANIZATION> stores will operate as <PERSON>I. Magnin</PERSON> stores.
<PERSON>Mr. Finkelstein</PERSON> is apparently referring to <PERSON>B. Altman</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Bonwit Teller</ORGANIZATION>, two <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> retailers that have recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, as well as the retail chains owned by financially troubled <ORGANIZATION>Campeau Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
Those chains include <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale</ORGANIZATION>'s, which <ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION> recently said it will sell.
Other retail properties for sale include <ORGANIZATION>Saks Fifth Avenue</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Marshall Field</ORGANIZATION>, retailers now owned by <ORGANIZATION>B.A.T PLC</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> tobacco conglomerate. 
In his letter, <PERSON>Mr. Finkelstein</PERSON> also referred to the recent <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> earthquake.
<PERSON>Mr. Finkelstein</PERSON> flew to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> the day after the earthquake, and found that 10 to 12 of his company's stores had sustained some damage, including the breakage of most windows at the I. Magnin store on Union Square. 
<ORGANIZATION>RJR Nabisco Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it agreed to sell its Baby Ruth, Butterfinger and <PERSON>Pearson</PERSON> candy businesses to <ORGANIZATION>Nestle S.A.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Nestle Foods</ORGANIZATION> unit for $370 million. 
The sale, at a higher price than some analysts had expected, helps the food and tobacco giant raise funds to pay debt and boosts <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION>'s 7% share of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> candy market to about 12%. 
The candy businesses had sales of about $154 million last year, which was roughly 12% of total revenue for <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Planters LifeSavers</ORGANIZATION> unit, according to a memorandum distributed by <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION>'s owner, <ORGANIZATION>Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, to bankers last December. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION> acquisition includes a candy plant in <LOCATION>Franklin Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, which employs about 800 workers. 
Roughly $2 billion of that debt has already been repaid from previous asset sales, and <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION> expects to use another $2 billion from the pending, two-part sale of most of its <ORGANIZATION>Del Monte</ORGANIZATION> unit.
<PERSON>Louis Gerstner Jr.</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of New York-based <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION>, called the sale a "significant step" in the company's divestiture program, as well as a "a strategic divestiture." Since <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> bought <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION> in February for $25 billion of debt, it has agreed to sell nearly $5 billion of <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION> assets.
<ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION>'s executives have said they will dispense with certain brands, in particular, that aren't leaders in their markets. "<ORGANIZATION>RJR Nabisco</ORGANIZATION> and Planters LifeSavers will concentrate more on our own core businesses," <PERSON>Mr. Gerstner</PERSON> said Friday. 
Baby <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> and <PERSON>Butterfinger</PERSON> are both among the top-selling 15 chocolate bars in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, but <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION>'s overall share of the roughly $5.1 billion market is less than 5%.
<ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION>'s share of 7% before Friday's purchases is far below the shares of market leaders <ORGANIZATION>Hershey Foods Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mars Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which have about 40% and 36% of the market, respectively. 
"This means <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION> is now in the candybar business in a big way," said <PERSON>Lisbeth Echeandia</PERSON>, publisher of <LOCATION>Orlando</LOCATION>, Fla.-based <ORGANIZATION>Confectioner Magazine</ORGANIZATION>. "For them, it makes all kinds of sense.
They've been given a mandate from <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>" to expand their <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> chocolate operations.
<ORGANIZATION>Nestle S.A.</ORGANIZATION> is based in <LOCATION>Vevey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>. 
The new candy bars, "make an important contribution to our <ORGANIZATION>Nestle Foods</ORGANIZATION> commitment to this very important strategic unit," said <PERSON>C. Alan MacDonald</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Nestle Foods</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Purchase</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION> 
<ORGANIZATION>Chamberlain Manufacturing Corp.</ORGANIZATION> won a $25.8 million <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> contract for 155mm artillery shell casings. 
<ORGANIZATION>Avondale Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> received a $13.5 million <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> contract for ship spare parts. 
The chief economist of <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION> finds himself in such a position as he buzzes the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> on his first road trip since backpedaling on a major prediction. 
But this September -- just when many market economists, including some at <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION>, believed that <PERSON>Mr. Straszheim</PERSON> was about to be proved right -- he took a detour if not a U-turn.
Two well-known colleagues who believe <PERSON>Mr. Straszheim</PERSON> was right the first time are <PERSON>David Bostian Jr.</PERSON> and <PERSON>A. Gary Shilling</PERSON>, both of whom run their own <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> research firms.
<PERSON>Mr. Shilling</PERSON>, who was <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION>'s chief economist from 1967 to 1971, has heralded a recession for months. "My own personal opinion is that Don threw in the towel just about the time he should have doubled his bet," he says. 
<PERSON>Dennis O'Brien</PERSON>, the treasurer of <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Edison Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, adopts a polite approach, waiting for an opportunity to ask about the forecast.
A good half-hour into breakfast at the <ORGANIZATION>Palmer House</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. O'Brien</PERSON> looks up from his plate after <PERSON>Mr. Straszheim</PERSON> says something about people who believe interest rates are about to nosedive. "I'm one of them who hope they will, with $6 billion in debt on the books.
In a chilly conference room at <ORGANIZATION>Alliance Capital Management</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, in contrast, the firm's money managers seem ready to pin <PERSON>Mr. Straszheim</PERSON> to the wall.
<PERSON>Alfred Harrison</PERSON>, the manager, shoves <PERSON>Mr. Straszheim</PERSON>'s handout back at him: "Do we want to go through this?
This somewhat-ambiguous assessment moves one <ORGANIZATION>Alliance</ORGANIZATION> portfolio manager to ask: "So, what is this -- a <LOCATION>Stealth</LOCATION> recession?" Another challenges <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION>'s bond recommendation last year. "We're not running that ad campaign any more," <PERSON>Mr. Straszheim</PERSON> snaps in a rare show of irritation.
<PERSON>Mr. Shilling</PERSON> understands <PERSON>Mr. Straszheim</PERSON>'s problems. "There's unbelievable pressure on economists to forecast these numbers," he says. "You make a forecast, and then you become its prisoner." 
We pulled that forecast," he begins matter-of-factly in a meeting with <ORGANIZATION>Piper</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Jaffray & Hopwood Inc.</ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, the first stop. 
<ORGANIZATION>CRA Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> said it agreed to sell a 40% stake in its Howick coal mine in the state of <LOCATION>New South Wales</LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Development Pty.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>RA</LOCATION> acquired the <LOCATION>Howick</LOCATION> coal mine Oct. 20 when it bought <ORGANIZATION>British Petroleum Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's Australian coal interests for $275 million.
<ORGANIZATION>CRA</ORGANIZATION> is 49%-owned by <ORGANIZATION>RTZ Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. 
Several of the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>'s own listed companies, led by giant <ORGANIZATION>Contel Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, are joining for the first time to complain about program trading and the exchange's role in it. 
Claiming program trading has turned the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> into a "gambling casino," <ORGANIZATION>Contel</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Charles Wohlstetter</PERSON> said that he and at least 20 other corporate executives are forming an unprecedented alliance.
The group will complain to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, to the heads of program-trading firms and to the heads of the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> itself, he said. 
"They should call {the exchange} Trump East," charged <PERSON>Mr. Wohlstetter</PERSON>, the 79-year-old founder of <ORGANIZATION>Contel</ORGANIZATION> who's also a former investment banker and stock trader. "What is the mission of the financial community -- to help some scavengers or schemers, or help corporate <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>?" <ORGANIZATION>Contel</ORGANIZATION> is a $6 billion telephone and electronics company. 
<PERSON>Mr. Wohlstetter</PERSON>, for example, said he wrote to <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>John J. Phelan Jr.</PERSON> about program trading after the 190-point Dow plunge, and as in previous queries, "what I get back is gobbledygook." He said he's upset that <PERSON>Mr. Phelan</PERSON>, trying to calm investors after the plunge, said that investors would simply have to get used to the market's big price swings.
The <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> "is partly to blame {for the price swings}, because they're cowards," said <PERSON>Mr. Wohlstetter</PERSON>. "Their powerful members manage them." 
<PERSON>Richard Grasso</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> president, last week said only that the exchange is concerned about all its constituents.
Privately, exchange officials worry that without a hospitable system for program trading at the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>, billions of dollars in trading will simply migrate to overseas exchanges such as <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s.
<ORGANIZATION>Contel</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Wohlstetter</PERSON> said the group of <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> companies isn't ready to go public yet with its effort, and that he doesn't plan to be the leader once it is public.
Among those <PERSON>Mr. Wohlstetter</PERSON> said he has been talking to are <ORGANIZATION>Sanford Weill of Primerica Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which is the parent of <ORGANIZATION>Smith Barney</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Harris Upham & Co.</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>GTE Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <PERSON>James Johnson</PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION>ITT Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <PERSON>Rand Araskog</PERSON>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Kemper Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Kemper Financial Services</ORGANIZATION> unit said it cut off <PERSON>Bear Stearns</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley, Oppenheimer</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Kidder, Peabody & Co.</ORGANIZATION> unit.
Chief Executive Officer <PERSON>Michael Carpenter</PERSON> said that despite the outcry even by some of <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION>'s own brokers, he believes index arbitrage doesn't have a "negative impact on the market as a whole." However, pressure on <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION>'s parent, GE, could change <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION>'s policy.
The current account deficit on <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s balance of payments narrowed to 1.48 billion French francs ($236.8 million) in August from a revised 2.1 billion francs in July, the <ORGANIZATION>Finance Ministry</ORGANIZATION> said. 
By <PERSON>Richterian</PERSON> standards, the show that the <ORGANIZATION>Oakland Athletics</ORGANIZATION> put on Friday and Saturday nights, in putting a mercifully swift end to the game's Longest Short Series, rated somewhere between a 10 and an 11.
The <ORGANIZATION>Pale Pachyderms</ORGANIZATION> propelled six of 'em out of the unfriendly confines of Candlestick Park during the two games en route to 13-7 and 9-6 wins over the <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco Giants</ORGANIZATION>.
That came in the seventh inning of Game Four when, trailing 8-2, they scored four times and brought their big heat -- <PERSON>Will Clark</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kevin Mitchell</PERSON> -- to the plate with one out and a runner on.
But <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> flied out to short right field and <PERSON>Mitchell</PERSON>'s drive to left was caught on the warning track by <PERSON>Rickey Henderson</PERSON> as 62,000 sets of lungs exhaled as one. 
"I went out to <PERSON>Todd</PERSON> {Burns, the A's reliever} and told him that we weren't gonna let this guy beat us," said <ORGANIZATION>Oakland</ORGANIZATION> catcher <PERSON>Terry Steinbach</PERSON> of the decisive confrontation with <PERSON>Mitchell</PERSON>, the National League's reigning home-run king. "I told him to make <PERSON>Mitchell</PERSON> reach for everything, and that's what we did.
That list includes last season's champs, the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Dodgers</ORGANIZATION>, who rode a miracle home run by <PERSON>Kirk Gibson</PERSON> and two faultless pitching performances by <PERSON>Orel Hershiser</PERSON> to a five-game triumph over a bewitched, bothered <ORGANIZATION>Oakland</ORGANIZATION> crew. 
They led the <ORGANIZATION>Major Leagues</ORGANIZATION> in regular-season wins with 99 and flattened the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Blue Jays</ORGANIZATION> four games to one for the American League pennant before stomping their cross-bay rivals.
The pithiest testimony to their domination of the just-concluded tournament came from <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>' manager <PERSON>Roger Craig</PERSON> after his team had fallen in Game Three to a five-home-run barrage that tied a 61-year-old Series record.
Eight <ORGANIZATION>Oakland</ORGANIZATION> players hit homers, with centerfielder <PERSON>Dave Henderson</PERSON> getting two, both on Friday.
Even with that power show, though, the <ORGANIZATION>Oakland Series</ORGANIZATION>' star, certified by the Most Valuable Player award, was a pitcher, <PERSON>Dave Stewart</PERSON>.
Afterward, as the A's toasted their victory with beer (they dispensed with traditional champagne showers in deference to the quake victims), <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> said he thought his championship-team ring would outshine his individual trophy. "Give me four or five more Series with these guys, and I don't care if I ever win a <PERSON>Cy Young</PERSON>," he said, in reference to baseball's best-pitcher award. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> trading Friday, <ORGANIZATION>Conseco</ORGANIZATION> closed at $19.50, down 25 cents. 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s biggest computer maker last week undercut seven competitors to win a contract to design a mapping system for the city of <LOCATION>Hiroshima</LOCATION>'s waterworks.
The bid created such a furor that <ORGANIZATION>Fujitsu</ORGANIZATION> said it is now offering to withdraw from the project. "From a common-sense viewpoint, it was not socially acceptable," a <ORGANIZATION>Fujitsu</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said yesterday.
<LOCATION>Hiroshima</LOCATION>'s waterworks bureau said the municipal government had budgeted about 11 million yen ($77,500) for the project. "I was flabbergasted," <PERSON>Tatsuhara Yamane</PERSON>, head of the bureau, was quoted by <ORGANIZATION>Kyodo news service</ORGANIZATION> as saying. "I understand the firm's enthusiasm in getting the deal, but such a large company would have been better off showing a little more discretion." 
<ORGANIZATION>Fujitsu</ORGANIZATION> said it hopes the <LOCATION>Hiroshima</LOCATION> contract will help it secure pacts with other municipalities.
Earlier this year, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> complained that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s supercomputer makers were effectively closing out foreign competitors by slashing prices as much as 90% for universities. 
<ORGANIZATION>Concord New Horizons Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, creators of a 1988 movie called <PERSON>Nam Angels</PERSON>, used the gang's name and trademarks without authorization, the not-for-profit corporation says in a complaint filed in federal court. 
<ORGANIZATION>Nam Angels</ORGANIZATION> depicts a group of the cycle gang's members on a mercenary mission to <PERSON>Viet Nam</PERSON> during the war years. 
Also named in the suit is <ORGANIZATION>Media Home Entertainment Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Culver City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, its parent, <ORGANIZATION>Heron Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Broadstar Television of Los Angeles</ORGANIZATION>, holders of the copyright on the movie. 
"There is absolutely no way our board or membership would have approved the portrayal of the <ORGANIZATION>Hells Angels</ORGANIZATION> in this movie," said <PERSON>George Christie</PERSON>, president of the club's <LOCATION>Ventura</LOCATION> chapter. "Portrayal of our members as disloyal to each other is totally contrary to the most important values of our organization -- loyalty and trust." 
<ORGANIZATION>Nam Angels</ORGANIZATION> shows <PERSON>Angels</PERSON> fighting with each other and also depicts them as showing no remorse when a member is killed.
Both of these actions aren't characteristic of real <ORGANIZATION>Hells Angels</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Christie</PERSON> said. 
The most controversial form of program trading, stock-index arbitrage, is "making it tough for traders to make money," declares <PERSON>Robert Antolini</PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION>OTC</ORGANIZATION> trading at <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette</ORGANIZATION>. 
The portion of <ORGANIZATION>OTC</ORGANIZATION> volume attributable to program trading isn't known, as it is on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, where it amounted to more than 13% in September.
<PERSON>Peter DaPuzzo</PERSON>, head of retail equity trading at <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton</ORGANIZATION>, acknowledges that he wasn't troubled by program trading when it began in the pre-crash bull market because it added liquidity and people were pleased to see stock prices rising. 
<ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Kidder Peabody</ORGANIZATION>, in addition to <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>, do program-trade OTC stocks.
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs</ORGANIZATION> say they do so only for customers, however.
"It makes no sense for us to put money at risk when you know you're going to lose," says <PERSON>Mr. Antolini</PERSON>, of <PERSON>Donaldson Lufkin</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Joseph Hardiman</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Securities Dealers</ORGANIZATION>, which oversees trading on <ORGANIZATION>Nasdaq</ORGANIZATION>, agrees that program trading is hurting the market's efforts to bring back small investors.
The <ORGANIZATION>OTC</ORGANIZATION> stocks in the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 include Nasdaq's biggest, such as <ORGANIZATION>Apple Computer</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>MCI Communications</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Tele-Communications</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Liz Claiborne</PERSON>.
Eight trading days after Oct. 12, the day before the stock market plunge, for instance, the <ORGANIZATION>Nasdaq Composite</ORGANIZATION> had fallen 4.3%, compared with 3.3% for the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500, 3.5% for the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index and 3.6% for the industrial average.
Three days later, as of Friday's close, the <ORGANIZATION>Nasdaq Composite</ORGANIZATION> was down 6%, compared with 5.9% for the industrial average, 5.7% for the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 and 5.8% for the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board Composite</ORGANIZATION>. 
The main reason for this lag is that individual investors own 65% of the OTC market's capitalization, according to <PERSON>Mr. Hardiman</PERSON>, much more than on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>LIN Broadcasting</ORGANIZATION> surged 4 5/8 to 112 5/8; <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth</ORGANIZATION> sweetened their merger agreement in an attempt to keep shareholders from tendering their shares to <ORGANIZATION>McCaw Cellular Communications</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Starpointe Savings Bank</ORGANIZATION> rose 3 to 20 after the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</ORGANIZATION> approved <ORGANIZATION>Dime Savings Bank of New York</ORGANIZATION>'s $21-a-share acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Starpointe</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>TransCanada PipeLines Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> said it plans to shift its headquarters to <LOCATION>Calgary</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION>, from <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> next year to cut costs and be closer to the upstream natural-gas industry. 
<ORGANIZATION>TransCanada</ORGANIZATION> transports all gas that moves eastward from <LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION>.
That includes all the gas consumed in <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Quebec</LOCATION>, along with the bulk of Canadian gas exports to the 
<PERSON>Walter Litvinchuk</PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Pan-Alberta Gas Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a Calgary-based gas marketing concern, said the industry will welcome the move. 
The move, which could cost <ORGANIZATION>TransCanada</ORGANIZATION> as much as 50 million Canadian dollars (US$42.5 million) in relocation and severance payments, should be complete by next summer, <PERSON>Mr. Maier</PERSON> said.
The company will save between C$4 million and C$6 million annually in office expenses and other administrative costs by moving to <LOCATION>Calgary</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Maier</PERSON> added. 
<ORGANIZATION>TransCanada</ORGANIZATION> is 49.1% owned by Montreal-based holding company <ORGANIZATION>BCE Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
The best of the crop was last week's season premiere of "In the Heat of the Night," the <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> series based on a 1967 feature film about a black <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> police detective in a small Southern town.
In the series, <ORGANIZATION>Virgil Tibbs</ORGANIZATION> (<PERSON>Howard Rollins</PERSON>) and his wife, <PERSON>Althea</PERSON> (<PERSON>Anne-Marie Johnson</PERSON>) have settled in <LOCATION>Sparta</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Miss</LOCATION>.
Because the show has acquired a sense of place by being filmed on location in <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, this episode -- in which <LOCATION>Althea</LOCATION> gets raped by an arrogant white schoolteacher -- does a decent job of tracing the social repercussions of the crime. 
The writer and executive producer of "Settle the Score," <PERSON>Steve Sohmer</PERSON>, is a graduate of <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> who participated in a <ORGANIZATION>PBS</ORGANIZATION> documentary, aired this summer, in which six members of the <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> class of 1963 ruminated about their lives since graduation.
At one point in the documentary, <PERSON>Mr. Sohmer</PERSON>, who is Jewish, says he felt rejected by many of the Protestants and <ORGANIZATION>Southerners</ORGANIZATION> he met at <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>.
He quotes one student saying, "You're just the kind of Jewboy we Southerners can't stand." <PERSON>Mr. Sohmer</PERSON> confesses that it was partly in response to such attitudes that he is now "a dweller on one of the two islands off the coast of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>." But is exile in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> enough?
The sole sympathetic character is the prodigal daughter Kate (<PERSON>Jaclyn Smith</PERSON>), and she is tolerable only by virtue of having nothing in common with her kinfolk, a truly benighted pack of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Protestants</ORGANIZATION> whose grim existence consists mostly of growing peaches and repressing sex. 
Her Pa (<PERSON>Howard Duff</PERSON>) is the kind of guy who, while saying grace at the supper table, pauses at the word "sin" and glares at the daughter he hasn't seen for two decades, because he knows in his heart that she enjoyed what happened in the cold-storage room, and has been indulging the same taste ever since in the fleshpots of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. 
Add the fact that any one of them, including Pa, could be her attacker, and you have a setting that doesn't resemble small-town <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, or even <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>'s nightmare of small-town <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, so much as a paranoid feminist dystopia like <PERSON>Margaret Atwood</PERSON>'s "The Handmaid's Tale," itself soon to be (you guessed it) a <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> movie. 
There are two exceptions: Josh (<PERSON>Jeffrey DeMunn</PERSON>), the local doctor who has always loved <LOCATION>Kate</LOCATION>; and Lincoln (<PERSON>Richard Masur</PERSON>), <PERSON>Kate</PERSON>'s simple-minded but affectionate brother.
Her sister-in-law (Amy Wright) is a sniveling prude afraid that <ORGANIZATION>Kate</ORGANIZATION> will seduce all the married men in town, including a particularly loathsome fellow named <PERSON>Tucker</PERSON>, whose idea of fun is to leave his wife at home tending to her bruises and cigarette burns, while he bullies <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> into a dance that consists of drooling on her while trying to break her ribs.
In <PERSON>Mr. Sohmer</PERSON>'s film, by contrast, we are urged to share the perverse excitement of the rapist creeping up on his victim, as the camera ogles <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> in various stages of undress and lingers on the sight of her trussed-up body during frequent flashbacks to the rape. 
With friends like <PERSON>Mr. Sohmer</PERSON>, do the feminists of <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> need enemies? 
There may be a truce in the long war of nerves between the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> over how this country conducts secret intelligence operations abroad. 
After years of mistrust born of Watergate, past misdeeds of the <ORGANIZATION>Central Intelligence Agency</ORGANIZATION>, and the <LOCATION>Iran-Contra</LOCATION> scandal, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Intelligence Committee</ORGANIZATION> appear ready -- for now, at least -- to trust each other when it comes to setting policy on covert activities.
<PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> has pledged as well to respect the 14-year-old executive order barring <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> agents from assassinating foreign leaders or helping others to do so.
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> never fully trusted former <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON>William Casey</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>National Security</ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON>John Poindexter</PERSON> to honor the ban. 
Despite objections by the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> also has agreed to the establishment of an inspector general at the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> who would be independent of the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> director. 
It also has removed a ban on <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> use of a contingency fund for covert acts and has agreed to wipe away some tortured and legalistic restrictions on coup planning put in place to ensure that the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> didn't get back in the assassination game. 
"We've finally been able to convince them that <PERSON>Casey</PERSON> and {<PERSON>Oliver</PERSON>} North don't work here anymore," says one administration official. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> even disclosed privately that one Reagan-era deal with <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> required him to notify the odious Panamanian dictator, <PERSON>Manuel Noriega</PERSON>, if the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> learned of a coup plot that might endanger his life.
<ORGANIZATION>Intelligence Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>David Boren</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Okla.</LOCATION>) and Vice Chairman <PERSON>William Cohen</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>), for their part, angrily accused the White House of selectively leaking classified documents and trying unfairly to shift the blame to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> for the bungled attempt to topple Gen. <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>. 
Instead, <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> and his aides made it clear they respected <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>'s role and felt they could work with the conservative <PERSON>Mr. Boren</PERSON> and the moderate <PERSON>Mr. Cohen</PERSON> to iron out their differences. 
<PERSON>Sen. Boren</PERSON> happily told reporters that there had been "a meeting of the minds" with the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>, and that the committee had given <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> "a clean slate," free of the impediments imposed during the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> years.
<PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> is reserving the right in "rare" instances to keep <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in the dark, asserting a constitutional prerogative the committee doesn't recognize.
And they continue anonymously attacking <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>William Webster</PERSON> for being too accommodating to the committee.
<PERSON>Boren</PERSON> and <PERSON>Cohen</PERSON> of wimping out, and they will warn that the lawmakers' concessions raise the specter of more internationally embarrassing covert operations like the mining of Nicaraguan harbors and the <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> arms sales. 
In the aftermath of the <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> massacre on June 4, economists advanced wildly divergent views on how <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> would be affected. 
Among the most upbeat was BT Brokerage (<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>) <LOCATION>Ltd</LOCATION>.
In a July analysis titled "From Euphoria to Despair," <PERSON>W.I. Carr</PERSON> (Far East) <LOCATION>Ltd.</LOCATION>, another securities firm, said that eroding confidence might undermine future economic development. 
That paradox is <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s economically rewarding yet politically perilous relationship with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. 
As a model of capitalist efficiency on southern <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s doorstep, <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s prospects look good.
But to <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> isn't purely business.
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s leaders have promised generous liberties for post-1997 <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Maureen Fraser</PERSON>, an economist with <PERSON>W.I. Carr</PERSON>, a subsidiary of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Banque Indosuez</PERSON>, believes that the territory may not be able to regain its momentum until some time after 1997.
But with local investors shaken by <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s political and economic turmoil, she says, a genuine recovery may not arrive until <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> can prove itself secure under Chinese sovereignty. 
In a soon-to-be published book on the territory, a political economist, <PERSON>Miron Mushkat</PERSON>, has derived three future scenarios from interviews with 41 <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> government officials and businessmen.
Nearly half of them argue that <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s uneasy relationship with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> will constrain -- though not inhibit -- long-term economic growth.
Since the <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> crisis erupted, <PERSON>Mr. Mushkat</PERSON> says, the scenario as depicted by the middle-of-the-road group bears a remarkable resemblance to the difficulties <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> currently faces.
Given <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s record, <PERSON>Mr. Mushkat</PERSON>'s "realists" might have sounded unduly conservative when the interviews took place two years ago.
It could lose some of its dynamism," says <PERSON>Mr. Mushkat</PERSON>, a director of <ORGANIZATION>Baring Securities</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>) <LOCATION>Ltd.</LOCATION>, a unit of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Barings PLC.</ORGANIZATION> "It doesn't have to be a disaster.
Barely visible on <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s property scene in 1985, by last year <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> had become the top foreign investor, spending $602 million.
Another -- and critical -- factor is the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s biggest export market.
Even before the <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> crisis, weak <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> demand was slowing local economic growth.
Many are refugees, having fled <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s unending cycles of political repression and poverty since the <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> took power in 1949.
Emigration applications soared in 1985, when <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> ratified their accord on <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s future.
"When the economy loses a big portion of its work force that also happens to include its most productive members, economic growth is bound to be affected," says <PERSON>Anthong Wong</PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION>Hang Seng Bank</ORGANIZATION>. 
An agreement to sell the <ORGANIZATION>Wilson</ORGANIZATION> assets for $150 million in cash and notes collapsed in late September, when the buyer, a company controlled by <PERSON>George Gillett</PERSON>, couldn't secure financing. 
<ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>GMC Truck</ORGANIZATION> division put a $750 cash incentive on its 1990 full-sized Jimmy and Suburban trucks. 
So producers <ORGANIZATION>Alyce</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Topper Carew</PERSON> spun their <PERSON>Rolodexes</PERSON> and gathered names of black opinion makers to mount a direct-mail campaign.
"Most of us grew up believing in the axioms `Haste makes waste' and `Don't cut corners, ' ideas that seem to run counter to the concept of managing speed," says <PERSON>Dean Cassell</PERSON>, vice president for product integrity at <ORGANIZATION>Grumman Corp.</ORGANIZATION> "But in the real world, you learn that speed and quality are not a trade-off.
One team at the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Express Ground Operations</ORGANIZATION> station in <LOCATION>Natick</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, focused on a particularly time-sensitive operation: the morning package sort.
Every morning, tractor-trailer trucks arrive at the <ORGANIZATION>Natick Ground Station</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Logan Airport</LOCATION>, carrying the day's package load.
"We're committed to deliver the customer's package by a stated time, usually 10:30," notes <PERSON>Glenn Mortimer</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Federal Express</ORGANIZATION> courier who led the <LOCATION>Natick</LOCATION> team. "The sooner our vans hit the road each morning, the easier it is for us to fulfill that obligation." 
Following a problem-solving formula used by teams throughout <ORGANIZATION>Federal Express</ORGANIZATION>, members of the <LOCATION>Natick</LOCATION> team monitored their morning routine, carefully noting where and when the work group's resources were used effectively and where they were idle, waiting for others upstream in the process to send packages their way. 
"Monitoring shows that the Natick team's new system really does reduce cycle time for the morning package sort," reports <PERSON>James Barksdale</PERSON>, chief operating officer at <ORGANIZATION>Federal Express</ORGANIZATION>. "The vans leave at least 15 minutes earlier, on average, than they used to.
A cross-functional team at <ORGANIZATION>Union Carbide</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Tonawanda</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, facility, which produces air-separation plants, followed a similar path to reduce manufacturing cycle time. 
At <LOCATION>Grumman</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Aircraft Systems Division</ORGANIZATION>, a cross-functional team reduced the cycle time required to produce a new business proposal for an important government contract.
"We needed contributions from all these departments to generate the proposal," says <PERSON>Carl Anton</PERSON>, configuration-data manager for <ORGANIZATION>Grumman</ORGANIZATION>'s A-6 combat aircraft program. "But instead of gathering their input piecemeal, we formed the team, which reached consensus on the proposal objectives and produced a statement of work to guide all the functions that were involved." 
The successes achieved at <ORGANIZATION>Federal Express</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Union Carbide</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Grumman</PERSON> suggest that managing speed may be an underutilized source of competitive advantage.

<PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> has to come to terms with <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> economic integration, beginning with the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary System</ORGANIZATION>, which <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> is committed to joining fully someday.
Though <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> has pulled through other crises, supporters wonder if her steely, autocratic ways are the right formula today. "There's a rising fear that perhaps <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>'s style of management has become a political liability," says <PERSON>Bill Martin</PERSON>, senior economist at <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> brokers <ORGANIZATION>UBS-Phillips & Drew</ORGANIZATION>. 
Last week, the strategy of playing the two experts off each other blew up: <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON> quit in exasperation and Sir <PERSON>Alan Walters</PERSON>, the adviser, announced his resignation within an hour. 
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s economy "is developing rapidly toward no-growth," says <PERSON>J. Paul Horne</PERSON>, international economist with <ORGANIZATION>Smith Barney, Harris Upham Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. 
Recovery could be hampered if <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s major trading partners in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, which are enjoying robust economic activity, cool off as expected in late 1990 and 1991. 
Though <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> doesn't need to call an election until June 1992, she would prefer doing so in late 1991. "If the economy shows no sign of turning around in about year's time, she will be very vulnerable," says <PERSON>John Barnes</PERSON>, a lecturer at the <ORGANIZATION>London School of Economics</ORGANIZATION>. 
It has sent mixed signals about its willingness to take part in the exchange-rate mechanism of the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary System</ORGANIZATION>, which links the major <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> currencies.
At a June <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> summit, <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> appeared to ease her opposition to full <ORGANIZATION>EMS</ORGANIZATION> membership, saying <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> would join once its inflation rate fell and the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> liberalized capital movements. 
Sir <PERSON>Alan</PERSON> assailed the monetary arrangement as "half-baked" in an article being published in an <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> economics journal.
Despite the departure of <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sir Alan</PERSON>, the tug-of-war over the <ORGANIZATION>EMS</ORGANIZATION> could continue.
Sir <PERSON>Geoffrey Howe</PERSON>, deputy prime minister and a <PERSON>Lawson</PERSON> ally on the <ORGANIZATION>EMS</ORGANIZATION>, has signaled he will continue pressing for early membership. 
Of immediate concern is whether the Thatcher government will continue <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>'s policy of tracking the monetary policies of the West German <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> and responding in kind when the <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> authorities move interest rates.
<PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> "doesn't like taking orders from foreigners," says <PERSON>Tim Congdon</PERSON>, economist with <ORGANIZATION>Gerrard & National Holding PLC</ORGANIZATION>. 
As Conservatives rally around <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> during the crisis, many harbor hopes last week's debacle will prompt change. "We won't have any more of this wayward behavior," says Sir <PERSON>Peter Hordern</PERSON>, a backbench Tory member of <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>. "The party is fed up with sackings of good people." 
Succeeding him as chairman and chief executive will be <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s parent, <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>, 49 years old, is reclaiming the job that was his before <PERSON>Mr. Corr</PERSON> signed on. 
<PERSON>Mr. Foret</PERSON>, 44, is a 15-year veteran of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Texas International Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, its predecessor.
The 48-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Corr</PERSON> was hired largely because he was credited with returning <ORGANIZATION>Trans World Airlines Inc.</ORGANIZATION> to profitability while he was its president from 1986 to 1988.
But <PERSON>Mr. Corr</PERSON>, a stunt pilot in his spare time, was understood to be frustrated by what he regarded as limited freedom under <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>. 
While not officially an executive at <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> during <PERSON>Mr. Corr</PERSON>'s tenure, <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> is known for keeping close tabs on <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>'s operating units.
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> is <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>'s flagship and was built painfully to its present size under <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> after emerging from bankruptcy proceedings in 1986. 
It's unclear what role, if any, <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>'s recent exploration of a possible sale of a stake in <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> had in <PERSON>Mr. Corr</PERSON>'s departure.
One source familiar with the airline said, however, that <PERSON>Mr. Corr</PERSON> wasn't informed in advance during the summer when <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> began discussions with potential buyers. 
<PERSON>Mr. Foret</PERSON> is one of a handful of executives <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> has relied on over the years.
Another longtime ally, <PERSON>Phil Bakes</PERSON>, currently heads <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>, now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.
Among the other alumni are <PERSON>Stephen Wolf</PERSON>, now chairman of <ORGANIZATION>UAL Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Thomas Plaskett</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
In the opener, <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION> would agree to buy <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in a transaction valued at close to $5 billion.
Shortly after that, <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> would offer to buy <ORGANIZATION>Guber-Peters Entertainment Co.</ORGANIZATION> for $200 million and offer its co-chairmen, <PERSON>Peter Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jon Peters</PERSON>, the chance to run <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> would fly to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> with the intention of telling <ORGANIZATION>Warner Communications Inc</ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON>Steven J. Ross</PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION>Guber-Peters</ORGANIZATION> planned to end its five-year contract to produce movies exclusively for <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>. 
In affidavits filed in <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Superior Court</ORGANIZATION> in connection with the $1 billion breach-of-contract suit <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> brought against <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> for hiring the two producers, <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> tell one story.
In the affidavits, <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> says he was "shocked" when <PERSON>Mr. Ross</PERSON> refused a meeting and made it clear he would stop them.
<PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> claims he reminded <PERSON>Mr. Ross</PERSON> that <PERSON>Robert Daly</PERSON> and <PERSON>Terry Semel</PERSON>, the top executives of the <ORGANIZATION>Warner Brothers</ORGANIZATION> studio, had "repeatedly agreed that we had every right to accept" an offer such as <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>'s.
In response, <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> says, <PERSON>Mr. Ross</PERSON> referred to his colleagues at <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> with an "obscenity" and said: "Tell them that they don't have a job.
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> denies <PERSON>Mr. Ross</PERSON> ever said any such thing, and, in fact, denies virtually everything <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> say in their affidavits.
Tomorrow, <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> will file another batch of documents contending that "the essence of everything these guys are saying is basically lies," says <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>'s chief outside counsel, <PERSON>Stuart Rabinowitz</PERSON>.
Thursday, a judge is scheduled to rule on <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>'s motion seeking to block the Guber-Peters duo from going to <LOCATION>Columbia</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> says that what it really wants is for the producers to fulfill their contractual obligations, but the bitterness of this battle and the accusations flying on both sides make it unlikely that the decade-long relationship between <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> and its two most prolific producers can ever be repaired.
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>, which is in the process of merging with <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, says it is willing to settle the matter out of court.
<PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> don't have much to gain from a protracted battle.
<ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>, for its part, could decide that the cost of a <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> settlement or court fight is too high, choosing instead to find someone else to run <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>, although that too would be costly given the financial arrangement already guaranteed to <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON>.
In that case, <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> might not suffer financially, but they would be left without their dream job of running a studio and with a considerably scarred relationship with <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> and the Guber-Peters team are hanging much of their case on <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>'s willingness last year to release the producers from another contract and on an oral agreement they say allowed them to terminate the current written contract if the opportunity to run a major studio came up.
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> denies such an agreement was made, and disputes the <ORGANIZATION>Guber-Peters</ORGANIZATION> version of virtually every telephone call and meeting the two sides had on the matter. 
<PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> say in their affidavits that <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> already is taking steps to freeze them out of their projects at <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>, notably the <PERSON>Sylvester Stallone</PERSON> film "<LOCATION>Tango</LOCATION> and Cash." 
<PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> says in his affidavit that the movie's staff was told last week that <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> was "taking over" the picture, and another producer would be giving all of the orders.
<PERSON>Hubert de la Bouillaire</PERSON>, an editor on the film, backs <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> in a separate sworn declaration.
<PERSON>Mr. de</PERSON> la <LOCATION>Bouillaire</LOCATION> says <ORGANIZATION>Warner Brothers</ORGANIZATION> production president <PERSON>Mark Canton</PERSON> called him Oct. 19 and said <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> is "off the picture.
If he calls you up, just tell him everything is fine." The editor also says the new producer on the film, <PERSON>Bruce Baird</PERSON>, told editors to screen the picture without telling stars <PERSON>Sylvester Stallone</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kurt Russell</PERSON> or <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON>. "The less they know, the easier it is for us.
If someone asks, just lie and tell them it will be done," <PERSON>Mr. de</PERSON> la <LOCATION>Bouillaire</LOCATION> says <PERSON>Mr. Baird</PERSON> told them. 
That, says <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Rabinowitz</PERSON>, is "a total 100% lie." The movie, he says, is in its post-production stages of "cleaning up the film." He says <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON>, as the contractual producers with consultation rights, have been invited to screenings and to give their input on the film.
Dozens of <ORGANIZATION>Guber-Peters</ORGANIZATION> staffers are still working on the <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> lot and consulting on various projects on a "daily basis," the attorney says. 
<PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON>, in his affidavit, says that when he advised <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Terry Semel</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> offer at lunch on Sept. 25, <PERSON>Mr. Semel</PERSON> "hugged and congratulated me, and expressed joy that we had finally realized our long-term ambition of running and having an equity position in a major entertainment company." 
<PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> says he brought to lunch a release document <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> had agreed to in 1988, when he and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> made an aborted bid to buy part of <ORGANIZATION>MGM/UA Entertainment Co.</ORGANIZATION> to run the <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION> studio.
He says he told <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> he couldn't sign any documents and that "the deal, although apparently a good one for him and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON>, would have a very negative impact on <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>." He said he would contact <PERSON>Mr. Ross</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Warner Brothers</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Robert Daly</PERSON> and that, in a conference call, the three agreed they couldn't let the producers out of their contract. 
<PERSON>Mr. Ross</PERSON>, in his own affidavit, says he and <PERSON>Mr. Daly</PERSON> instructed <PERSON>Mr. Semel</PERSON> to tell the producers <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> wouldn't terminate their agreement. 
<PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> says that <PERSON>Mr. Semel</PERSON> did convey that information and that <PERSON>Mr. Semel</PERSON> said <PERSON>Mr. Ross</PERSON> was "crazy because of the Time deal," meaning, <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> says, that <PERSON>Mr. Ross</PERSON> "did not want to communicate to his new merger partner, <ORGANIZATION>Time Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, that <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>'s agreements provided for our departure under these circumstances." 
<PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> also says in his affidavit that <PERSON>Mr. Daly</PERSON> "told us that even if <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> did not want us, <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>'s relationship with us already was irreparably damaged, that there was no way `to put the egg together, ' and that it would sue <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> for tons of money." 
Moreover, <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> claims, <PERSON>Mr. Semel</PERSON> told him that <PERSON>Mr. Ross</PERSON> probably wouldn't object "if it were anybody other than <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>.
But <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> is a problem." The <ORGANIZATION>Guber-Peters</ORGANIZATION> side has said <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> is particularly concerned about the prospect of a huge Japanese company controlling important segments of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> entertainment business. 
Some in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> suggest <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> took encouragement from <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> studio executives such as <PERSON>Mr. Semel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Canton</PERSON> too literally.
According to this theory, <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> executives, hoping to strengthen their relationships with the producers, encouraged <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> in their ambitions to build a major entertainment company.
<PERSON>Mr. Rabinowitz</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> attorney, says the studio still wants the producers to come back and fulfill their contract. "They are like a mini-studio; they have 50 projects in development for <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>," he says. 
For example, he says that since 1985, he and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> have developed over 85 movie projects, and <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> has "passed" or chosen not to produce at least 76. 
<ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's rail-car leasing unit completed the $178.5 million purchase of similar businesses from <ORGANIZATION>Leucadia National Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Brae Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, 74%-owned by <LOCATION>Leucadia</LOCATION>, the sellers said. 
The buyer was <ORGANIZATION>GE Capital Railcar Services</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, a major owner of railway equipment and part of the <ORGANIZATION>GE Capital</ORGANIZATION> operations. 
<LOCATION>Leucadia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, estimated it had a pre-tax gain on the transaction of $57 million, including its part of <LOCATION>Brae</LOCATION>'s gain.

Departing from its newspaper ads featuring prim sketches of a suit or a coat, <ORGANIZATION>Brooks Brothers</ORGANIZATION> is marketing an updated image in a new campaign that carries the slogan, "The Surprise of <ORGANIZATION>Brooks Brothers</ORGANIZATION>." One color photo displays a rainbow of dress shirts tied in a knot; another picture shows neckties with bold designs.
<ORGANIZATION>Brooks Brothers</ORGANIZATION> hopes that shaking its time-honored traditions will attract more young men and more women and change consumer perceptions about its range of merchandise. "We have men who only buy their shirts and underwear here or younger customers who only buy their {job} interview suit here," says <PERSON>William Roberti</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Brooks Brothers</ORGANIZATION>. "We want them to buy more of their wardrobe here." Industry watchers agree that <ORGANIZATION>Brooks Brothers</ORGANIZATION> is long overdue in updating its buttoned-down image, which has stunted its growth.
When acquired in May 1988 by British retailer <ORGANIZATION>Marks & Spencer PLC</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Brooks Brothers</ORGANIZATION>' annual operating profit was about $41.8 million on sales of $290.1 million.
Many clothiers, especially <PERSON>Ralph Lauren</PERSON>, have cashed in on the recent popularity of updated <ORGANIZATION>Ivy League</ORGANIZATION> and English styles.
The rigid <ORGANIZATION>Ivy League</ORGANIZATION> customer, <ORGANIZATION>Brooks Brothers</ORGANIZATION>' bread and butter, meanwhile is becoming extinct.
Thus, <ORGANIZATION>Brooks Brothers</ORGANIZATION> has lost customers to stores that offer more variety such as <PERSON>Paul Stuart</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Barneys New York</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Louis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>. 
"<ORGANIZATION>Brooks Brothers</ORGANIZATION> no longer has a lock on the {Ivy League} customer who is status-conscious about his clothes," says <PERSON>Charlie Davidson</PERSON>, president of the Andover Shop, a traditional men's store in <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>. 
Despite these challenges, <ORGANIZATION>Marks & Spencer</ORGANIZATION> sees big potential in <ORGANIZATION>Brooks Brothers</ORGANIZATION>, noting the widely recognized name and global presence.
<ORGANIZATION>Marks & Spencer</ORGANIZATION> plans to open roughly 18 more <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stores in the next five years.
<ORGANIZATION>Brooks Brothers</ORGANIZATION> says business is robust at its 30 outlets in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and two shops in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Marks & Spencer</ORGANIZATION> is also considering opening stores across <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> sometime in the future. 
<PERSON>Alan Smith</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Marks & Spencer North America</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>, says that <ORGANIZATION>Brooks Brothers</ORGANIZATION>' focus is to boost sales by broadening its merchandise assortment while keeping its "traditional emphasis." The British parent is also streamlining: <ORGANIZATION>Brooks Brothers</ORGANIZATION>, which continues to make almost all of its merchandise, recently shut one of its two shirt plants in <LOCATION>Paterson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, and has closed boys' departments in all but 20 stores. 
The centerpiece of the overhaul, according to <PERSON>Mr. Roberti</PERSON>, is the men's tailored clothing department, where <ORGANIZATION>Brooks Brothers</ORGANIZATION> has added new suit styles and fabrics. "The perception out there is that we are very conservative and we only sell one type of suit," <PERSON>Mr. Roberti</PERSON> says, referring to <ORGANIZATION>Brooks Brothers</ORGANIZATION>' signature three-button "sack suit," with a center-vented jacket and boxy fit. 
Catastrophe losses reduced <ORGANIZATION>Aetna</ORGANIZATION>'s net income by $50 million, including $36 million from <LOCATION>Hugo</LOCATION>.

<ORGANIZATION>Institut Merieux S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, which offered 942 million Canadian dollars (US$801.2 million), or C$37 a share for <ORGANIZATION>Connaught</ORGANIZATION>, said it would extend its bid, due to expire last Thursday, to Nov. 6. 
A C$30-a-share bid by <ORGANIZATION>Ciba-Geigy Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a pharmaceutical company based in <LOCATION>Basel</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>, and California-based <ORGANIZATION>Chiron Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a bioresearch concern, was extended to Nov. 16.
<ORGANIZATION>Merieux</ORGANIZATION>, a vaccine and bioresearch firm based in <LOCATION>Lyon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, is controlled 50.1% by state-owned <ORGANIZATION>Rhone Poulenc S.A.</ORGANIZATION> 
The Canadian government previously said <PERSON>Merieux</PERSON>'s bid didn't offer enough "net benefit" to <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> to be approved, and gave <ORGANIZATION>Merieux</ORGANIZATION> an until mid-November to submit additional information. 
<ORGANIZATION>Institut Merieux</ORGANIZATION>, which already holds a 12.5% stake in Connaught, said that at the close of business Thursday, 5,745,188 shares of <ORGANIZATION>Connaught</ORGANIZATION> and C$44.3 million face amount of debentures, convertible into 1,826,596 common shares, had been tendered to its offer.
At the close of business Thursday, <ORGANIZATION>Ciba-Geigy</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Chiron</ORGANIZATION> said 11,580 common shares had been tendered to their offer.
Separately, the <ORGANIZATION>Ontario Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> said it will postpone indefinitely a ruling on the lawsuit launched by the <ORGANIZATION>University of Toronto</ORGANIZATION> against <ORGANIZATION>Connaught</ORGANIZATION> in connection with the <ORGANIZATION>Merieux</ORGANIZATION> bid. 
The bolstered cellular agreement between <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>LIN Broadcasting Corp.</ORGANIZATION> carries heightened risks and could fail to fend off <ORGANIZATION>McCaw Cellular Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the rival suitor for <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION>. 
Moreover, the amended pact shows how <PERSON>McCaw</PERSON>'s persistence has pushed <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth</ORGANIZATION> into a corner, forcing huge debt on the proposed new company.
The plan still calls for <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> to combine its cellular telephone properties with <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth</ORGANIZATION>'s and to spin off its broadcasting operations.
In addition, New York-based <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> would exercise its right to buy out for $1.9 billion the 55% equity interest of its partner, <ORGANIZATION>Metromedia Co.</ORGANIZATION>, in a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> cellular franchise.
In effect, <PERSON>McCaw</PERSON> has forced <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION>'s hand by bidding $1.9 billion for the stake earlier this month. 
"We're taking on more debt than we would have liked to," acknowledged <PERSON>Michael Plouf</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION>'s vice president and treasurer.
McCaw, the largest provider of cellular telephone service in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, already owns about 9.4% of <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION>'s stock.
In response to <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth</ORGANIZATION>'s amended pact, the <LOCATION>Kirkland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, company extended its own offer to buy 22 million <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> shares for $125 apiece, which would give McCaw a 50.3% controlling interest.
Over the weekend, <PERSON>McCaw</PERSON> continued to call for an auction of <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said they expect McCaw to escalate the bidding again. 
"This game isn't over yet," said <PERSON>Joel D. Gross</PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.</ORGANIZATION> "At some point, it will become non-economical for one company.
To sweeten the pact further -- and to ease concerns of institutional investors -- <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth</ORGANIZATION> added a provision designed to give extra protection to holders if the regional <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> company ever decides to buy the rest of the new cellular company.
We didn't expect <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth</ORGANIZATION> to be so responsive," said <PERSON>Frederick A. Moran</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Moran Asset Management Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which holds 500,000 <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> shares.
But <PERSON>Kenneth Leon</PERSON>, a telecommunications analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Bear, Stearns & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, finds the <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth</ORGANIZATION> proposal still flawed because the company doesn't have to wait five years to begin buying more <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> shares. "How many shares will be around in 1995?" he asked. "There's nothing preventing <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth</ORGANIZATION> from buying up shares in the meanwhile." 
<PERSON>William O. McCoy</PERSON>, president of the company's <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth Enterprises Inc.</ORGANIZATION> unit, said the revised agreement with <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> would dilute <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth</ORGANIZATION> earnings by about 9% in both 1990 and 1991 and by significantly less thereafter.
In composite trading Friday on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth</ORGANIZATION> shares fell 87.5 cents to $52.125. 
<PERSON>Mr. Leon</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Bear Stearns</ORGANIZATION> speculated that <PERSON>McCaw</PERSON>, in an attempt to buy time, might consider filing an antitrust suit against <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth</ORGANIZATION> with the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Harold Greene</PERSON>, who oversees enforcement of the consent decree that broke up the <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> system in 1984. 
Urging <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> directors to conduct "a fair auction on a level playing field," <PERSON>McCaw</PERSON> asked how well the public interest would be served "with the <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> operating companies controlling over 94% of all cellular {potential customers} in the nation's top 10 markets." 
<ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> said it extended the offer to allow shareholders time to review a supplement to the <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> tender offer circular that it mailed last Friday. 
The supplement contains various information that has been filed with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> since <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> launched the offer on Sept. 26, but it doesn't change the terms and conditions of the offer except to extend its expiration date. 
In <ORGANIZATION>Delaware Chancery Court</ORGANIZATION> litigation, <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> has criticized Dow Jones for not disclosing that <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION>'s management expects the company's revenue to increase by 20% annually, while <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> based its projections of <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION>'s performance on a 12% revenue growth forecast.
<ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> shares fell 50 cents on Friday to close at $20 each in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading.
<ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> shares also fell 50 cents to close at $36.125 in <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> composite trading. 
<ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> has said it believes the $18-a-share price is fair to <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION>'s minority shareholders.
<ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION>, which owns 67% of <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION>, publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barron's magazine, community newspapers and operates financial news services and computer data bases. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading Friday, <ORGANIZATION>Ferro</ORGANIZATION> closed at $25.25, down 50 cents. 
<PERSON>Mr. Good</PERSON> devotes much serious space to the events of Feb. 25, 1942, when <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> gunners spotted strange lights in the sky above <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Good</PERSON>, who documents these things as best he can, provides an official explanation in the form of a memorandum from Chief of Staff <PERSON>George C. Marshall</PERSON> to President Roosevelt: "1,430 pounds of ammunition," he wrote his commander in chief, were expended on "unidentified aircraft," flying at speeds as slow as 200 mph and elevations between 9,000 and 18,000 feet. 
<ORGANIZATION>Gerald Ford</ORGANIZATION>, a fairly down-to-earth fellow, once sent a letter to the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Armed Services Committee</ORGANIZATION> recommending that "there be a committee investigation of the <ORGANIZATION>UFO</ORGANIZATION> phenomenon.
Speculation as to the nature of aliens will no doubt continue until we wake up one morning to find they've taken over "The Today Show," the way they overwhelm an entire town in <PERSON>Jack Finney</PERSON>'s "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (<ORGANIZATION>Fireside/Simon & Schuster</ORGANIZATION>, 216 pages, $8.95).
Another guy who thinks they're out there and closing fast is <PERSON>Whitley Strieber</PERSON>, whose new novel, "Majestic" (<LOCATION>Putnam</LOCATION>, 317 pages, $18.95), takes a look at a reported 1947 UFO crash near the <ORGANIZATION>Roswell Army Air Field</ORGANIZATION> in a <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> desert.
<PERSON>Mr. Shiflett</PERSON> is an editorial writer for the <ORGANIZATION>Rocky Mountain News</ORGANIZATION>. 
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, <PERSON>Nigel Lawson</PERSON>, resigned because Prime Minister <PERSON>Thatcher</PERSON> would not fire her trusted adviser Sir <PERSON>Alan Walters</PERSON>.
The opposition <ORGANIZATION>Labor Party</ORGANIZATION> leader, <PERSON>Neil Kinnock</PERSON>, in a display of the male chauvinism typical of the British lower class, denounced <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> for having an independent mind and refusing to heed the men in her Cabinet.
The <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> press, making a mountain out of a molehill, precipitated an unnecessary economic crisis by portraying <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> as an autocrat who had thrown economic policy into confusion by driving a respected figure from her government. 
When <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> cut the top tax rate to 40%, <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON> flooded the country with money to prevent the pound from rising against the mark.
This doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>'s policies had created, producing widespread disaffection and pushing <ORGANIZATION>Labor</ORGANIZATION> ahead in the polls. 
Instead of realizing his mistake in letting the exchange rate dominate both British economic policy and <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>'s political fortune, <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON> pushed for tying the pound formally to the mark by entering the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary System</ORGANIZATION>, which subordinates all member currencies to <LOCATION>German</LOCATION> monetary policy.
It was fear of disturbing EMS exchange-rate relationships that caused the <LOCATION>Chirac</LOCATION> government in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> to be timid about cutting tax rates.
Consequently, <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON> saddled <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> with a record trade deficit, renewed inflation and high interest rates -- three political failures in a row.
Little wonder that <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>'s opponents were so anxious to keep <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON> in office. 
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and all of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> need to reconsider the prospects for European integration in light of the possible reunification and neutralization of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>.
A unified <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> that remained within the Western alliance would give <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> such an overshadowing position that all other members of a unified <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> would become vassals of the German state.
The implications for <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and the rest of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> of having their currencies tied to the economic policy of a neutral country need considering before we judge <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>'s resignation to be unfortunate. 
<PERSON>Mr. Roberts</PERSON> was assistant <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> secretary under President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>. 
So far as we can see only two persons are behaving with a dignity recognizing the seriousness of the issues: <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON> and Sir <PERSON>Alan Walters</PERSON>, the counterpoint of the Chancellor's difficulties, who also resigned as personal adviser to <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>. 
This is a problem not only for Prime Minister Thatcher but for President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, as shown in the ongoing bickering over the dollar between the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Mulford Treasury</ORGANIZATION>. 
In the British case, <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON> is the closest thing in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> to a supply-side globalist.
He not only slashed marginal tax rates, initially sparking fresh growth in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, but he wanted to regulate monetary policy by targeting exchange rates, indeed joining the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary System</ORGANIZATION>.
While no doubt agreeing with <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON> on everything else, <PERSON>Sir Alan</PERSON> is a dyed-in-the-wool monetarist, inclined to defend floating rates to the death. 
To make matters even more confusing, the earlier <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> experience made clear that <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>'s tax cuts would have profound effects on <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s international accounts and the value of sterling.
<PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>, though not allowed to join the <ORGANIZATION>EMS</ORGANIZATION>, chose to "shadow" the deutsche mark.
We had been soliciting opinions on it long before <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>'s resignation, and offer some of the collection for the benefit of his successor and one-time deputy, <PERSON>John Major</PERSON>.
To begin with, we should note that in contrast to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> deficit, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> has been running largish budget surpluses.
Unlike the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> never achieved even a momentary reduction in real wages.
The wage stickiness, which <ORGANIZATION>OECD</ORGANIZATION> studies confirm is particularly high in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, gives its economy a structural bias toward inflation.
Nearby <PERSON>Paul Craig Roberts</PERSON>, a distinguished supply-sider with monetarist sympathies, argues the case for <PERSON>Sir Alan</PERSON>.
We recall that <PERSON>Mr. Roberts</PERSON> not only chides the Chancellor for being too easy because of a desire to constrain sterling, but also led the chorus saying that <PERSON>Mr. Volcker</PERSON> was too tight when he let the dollar rise.
We sympathize with <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>'s reluctance to tie her currency to one governed by the domestic political imperatives of <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>.
What <PERSON>Mr. Major</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> will do now remains to be seen.
This was the version of supply-side economics that, in the late 1970s and early '80s, worked in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and world-wide to solve a far more serious stagflation than afflicts <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> today. 
<PERSON>Stuart E. Eizenstat</PERSON>, a partner in the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION>Powell</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Goldstein</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Frazer & Murphy</ORGANIZATION>, was named a director of this utility holding company, increasing board membership to 14. 
<PERSON>Mr. Miller</PERSON>, who has been a <ORGANIZATION>Coda</ORGANIZATION> director, also was named chief executive officer, succeeding <PERSON>Ted Eubank</PERSON>, who remains president and chief operating officer. 
<ORGANIZATION>Polly Peck International Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's agreement to acquire 51% of <ORGANIZATION>Sansui Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> proves that foreign companies can acquire Japanese companies -- if the alternative for the Japanese company is extinction. 
<PERSON>Polly Peck</PERSON>, a fast-growing British conglomerate, will pay 15.6 billion yen ($110 million) for 39 million new shares of <LOCATION>Sansui</LOCATION>, a well-known maker of high-fidelity audio equipment that failed to adjust to changing market conditions.
<PERSON>Polly Peck</PERSON>'s chairman, <PERSON>Asil Nadir</PERSON>, echoed the official Japanese view of the accord, which was announced Friday. 
"The myths that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> is not open to concerns from outside has, I think, been demolished at a stroke," <PERSON>Mr. Nadir</PERSON> said. 
It expects to post a loss of 6.4 billion yen for the year ending tomorrow and its liabilities currently exceed its assets by about 13.8 billion yen. "If you find sound, healthy companies in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, they are not for sale," said <PERSON>George Watanabe</PERSON>, a management-consultant at Tokyo-based <ORGANIZATION>Asia Advisory Services Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
Statistics on acquisitions by foreigners vary in detail, because unlike <ORGANIZATION>Sansui</ORGANIZATION>, which is listed on the <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Osaka</LOCATION> stock exchanges, most of the Japanese companies acquired by foreigners are privately held.
<PERSON>Sansui</PERSON> was once one of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s premier makers of expensive, high-quality stereo gear for audiophiles. 
Some of <ORGANIZATION>Sansui</ORGANIZATION>'s fellow audio-specialty companies, such as <ORGANIZATION>Aiwa Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Pioneer Electric Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, responded to the challenge by quickly bringing out mini-component products of their own, by moving heavily into the booming compact disk businesses or by diversifying into other consumer-electronics fields, including laser disks or portable cassette players.
While competitors moved production offshore in response to the sagging competitiveness of Japanese factories, <PERSON>Sansui</PERSON> lacked the money to build new plants in <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION>. "Our company has not been able to cope very effectively with" changes in the marketplace, said <PERSON>Ryosuke Ito</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Sansui</ORGANIZATION>'s president. 
<PERSON>Yoshihisa Murasawa</PERSON>, a management consultant for <ORGANIZATION>Booz-Allen & Hamilton</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>) <ORGANIZATION>Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said his firm will likely be recommending acquisitions of Japanese companies more often to foreign clients in the future. "Attitudes {toward being acquired} are still negative, but they're becoming more positive," <PERSON>Mr. Murasawa</PERSON> said. "In some industries, like pharmaceuticals, acquisitions make sense." 
Whether <PERSON>Polly Peck</PERSON>'s acquisition makes sense remains to be seen, but at the news conference, <PERSON>Mr. Nadir</PERSON> brimmed with self-confidence that he can turn <LOCATION>Sansui</LOCATION> around.
<PERSON>Sansui</PERSON>, he said, is a perfect fit for <PERSON>Polly Peck</PERSON>'s electronics operations, which make televisions, videocassette recorders, microwaves and other products on an "original equipment maker" basis for sale under other companies' brand names. 
He said <PERSON>Polly Peck</PERSON> will greatly expand <PERSON>Sansui</PERSON>'s product line, using <ORGANIZATION>Sansui</ORGANIZATION>'s engineers to design the new products, and will move <ORGANIZATION>Sansui</ORGANIZATION>'s production of most products other than sophisticated audio gear offshore into <PERSON>Polly Peck</PERSON>'s own factories. 
"Whatever capital it (<LOCATION>Sansui</LOCATION>) needs so it can compete and become a totally global entity capable of competing with the best in the world, that capital will be injected," <PERSON>Mr. Nadir</PERSON> said. 
And while <PERSON>Polly Peck</PERSON> isn't jettisoning the existent top-management structure of <LOCATION>Sansui</LOCATION>, it is bringing in a former <ORGANIZATION>Toshiba Corp.</ORGANIZATION> executive as executive vice president and chief operating officer. 
Such risk taking is an everyday matter for the brash <PERSON>Mr. Nadir</PERSON>, who is 25% owner of <PERSON>Polly Peck</PERSON> as well as its chairman.
In September, it announced plans to acquire the tropical-fruit business of <ORGANIZATION>RJR Nabisco Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Del Monte</ORGANIZATION> foods unit for #557 million ($878 million).

Bowing to a mounting public outcry, three more major securities firms -- Bear, <ORGANIZATION>Stearns & Co</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Oppenheimer & Co.</ORGANIZATION> -- announced Friday they would suspend stock-index arbitrage trading for their own accounts. 
<ORGANIZATION>Wells Fargo Investment Advisers</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Bankers Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mellon Capital Management</ORGANIZATION> are among the top stock-index arbitrage clients of Wall Street, trading executives say.
In fact, without Wall Street firms trading for their own accounts, the stock-index arbitrage trading opportunities for the big funds may be all the more abundant. "More customers may come to us now," said <PERSON>James Cayne</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Bear Stearns Cos</ORGANIZATION>. 
They noted that studies completed after the 1987 crash exonerated program trading as a source of volatility. "The issues that are (now) being raised, in classic anti-intellectual fashion, fly in the face of a number of post-crash studies," said <PERSON>Fred Grauer</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Wells Fargo Investment Advisers</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Wells Fargo Investment Advisers</ORGANIZATION>, for example, managed $25 billion in stock investments tracking the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 at the end of June, according to <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor's Corp</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Grauer</PERSON> said $2 billion of that is used in active index arbitrage. 
Last Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION>Kemper Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Kemper Financial Services Inc.</ORGANIZATION> unit said it would no longer trade with firms committed to stock-index arbitrage, including the three that later suspended stock-index arbitrage trading on Friday.
<ORGANIZATION>Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Founders Asset Management Inc.</ORGANIZATION> also cut off brokerage firms that engage in program trading. 
Though it is still doing stock-index arbitrage trades for customers, <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley</ORGANIZATION>'s trading halt for its own account is likely to shake up firms such as <ORGANIZATION>Kidder, Peabody & Co.</ORGANIZATION> that still do such trades for their own account.
Indeed, <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley</ORGANIZATION>'s president, <PERSON>Richard B. Fisher</PERSON>, said the firm is putting up money to form a group of regulators, investors and investment banks to find out if stock-index arbitrage artificially induces stock-market volatility. 
Separately, <PERSON>Mr. Cayne</PERSON> of <PERSON>Bear Stearns</PERSON> said his firm is working with regulators to balance margin requirements to "enhance stabilization." Margin rules determine the minimum amount of cash an investor must put up when buying a security.
"There has to be better coordination on a regulatory basis," said <PERSON>Christopher Pedersen</PERSON>, director of trading at <ORGANIZATION>Twenty-First Securities Corp.</ORGANIZATION> "One agency should have the authority over all equity products." 
The 57-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Gressette</PERSON>, who was also elected chairman and chief executive of all Scana subsidiaries, succeeds <PERSON>John A. Warren</PERSON>.
That's the conclusion of an independent report prepared by the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Technology Assessment</ORGANIZATION> at the request of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> judiciary committees.
The longstanding position of the <ORGANIZATION>Recording Industry Association of America</ORGANIZATION>, a trade group based in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, is that record companies, performers, songwriters and music publishers need to be remunerated by government-imposed fees on the sale of blank tapes and recording equipment to make up for royalties lost to home taping. 
"I think it is a nail in the coffin in any royalty tax proposal," says <PERSON>Gary Shapiro</PERSON>, vice president for government and legal affairs of the <ORGANIZATION>Electronic Industries Association</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. "What {the report} shows is everything we've been saying for the past eight or nine years -- that audio taping is the best thing to happen for the recording industry.
A recent agreement between the recording industry and electronics manufacturers requires that any digital audio tape, or DAT, recorder sold in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> have a built-in device that restricts its ability to make second copies from <ORGANIZATION>DAT</ORGANIZATION> tape copies of digital compact disks.
The study says that the "ambiguous legal status" of home copying makes it "appropriate to examine the effects on consumers, as well as on industry." Reports by the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Technology Assessment</ORGANIZATION> don't prescribe any specific legislative action but suggest a range of options that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> may pursue. 
<ORGANIZATION>Arthur Price</ORGANIZATION> abruptly quit as president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>MTM Entertainment Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> production company that has fallen on hard times. 
<PERSON>Mr. Price</PERSON>, 61 years old, also stepped down from the board of <ORGANIZATION>TVS Entertainment PLC</ORGANIZATION>, the British TV company that last year bought <ORGANIZATION>MTM</ORGANIZATION>, producer of such TV programs as "Hill Street Blues" and "The <PERSON>Mary Tyler Moore Show</PERSON>." 
A <ORGANIZATION>TVS</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said he didn't know <PERSON>Mr. Price</PERSON>'s plans.
<PERSON>James Gatward</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>TVS</ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive, said in a statement that he will "assume overall responsibility" for <ORGANIZATION>MTM</ORGANIZATION>'s operations until a successor is named. 
Industry analysts speculated that <PERSON>Mr. Price</PERSON>'s sudden departure may have stemmed from conflicts with <PERSON>Mr. Gatward</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Price</PERSON> "wanted to run the <ORGANIZATION>MTM</ORGANIZATION> business" and may have regretted selling the company to <ORGANIZATION>TVS</ORGANIZATION>, suggested <PERSON>Charles Denton</PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION>Zenith Productions</ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Carlton Communications PLC</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. 
In the <ORGANIZATION>TVS</ORGANIZATION> statement, <PERSON>Mr. Price</PERSON> said "leaving <ORGANIZATION>MTM</ORGANIZATION> was a very difficult decision," but added that "it is now time for a change. . . ." 
The $320 million purchase of <ORGANIZATION>MTM</ORGANIZATION> represented an audacious international move for <ORGANIZATION>TVS</ORGANIZATION>, which then was about half the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> concern's size.
At the time, <PERSON>Mr. Gatward</PERSON> said his friendship with <PERSON>Mr. Price</PERSON> had smoothed the way for its link with the small British company.
But <ORGANIZATION>TVS</ORGANIZATION> stunned industry analysts last month by disclosing that it expected <ORGANIZATION>MTM</ORGANIZATION> to post an operating loss for this year. 
In that announcement, <ORGANIZATION>TVS</ORGANIZATION> also said it was trimming production finance and hiring a new <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales manager.
<PERSON>Mr. Gatward</PERSON> has spent a lot of time since late September at <ORGANIZATION>MTM</ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters; he eliminated three departments and fired six executives, according to the <ORGANIZATION>TVS</ORGANIZATION> spokesman.
<ORGANIZATION>TVS</ORGANIZATION> blames difficulties in peddling reruns of <ORGANIZATION>MTM</ORGANIZATION> shows to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> broadcasters for the problems at <ORGANIZATION>MTM</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Price</PERSON> co-founded <ORGANIZATION>MTM</ORGANIZATION> in 1969 with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> actress <PERSON>Mary Tyler Moore</PERSON> and <PERSON>Grant Tinker</PERSON>, her then-husband.
<PERSON>Mr. Tinker</PERSON> later left to become chairman of <ORGANIZATION>National Broadcasting Co</ORGANIZATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>TVS</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said <PERSON>Mr. Price</PERSON> still holds about an 8% TVS stake, acquired as part of the <ORGANIZATION>MTM</ORGANIZATION> acquisition.
In late trading on <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> Friday, <ORGANIZATION>TVS</ORGANIZATION> shares rose four pence to 195 pence a share. 
When <ORGANIZATION>Westinghouse Electric Corp.</ORGANIZATION> shuttered its massive steam turbine plant in <LOCATION>Lester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, three years ago, it seemed like the company had pulled the plug on its century-old power generation business. 
And with its new venture with <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, announced last week, it is poised to penetrate growing markets overseas. 
Analysts agree, predicting that the revived market could significantly boost <ORGANIZATION>Westinghouse</ORGANIZATION>'s bottom line in coming years. "<ORGANIZATION>Westinghouse</ORGANIZATION>'s earnings could be materially enhanced in the mid-1990s or sooner," says <PERSON>Russell L. Leavitt</PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
Already this year, it has received orders for four 150-megawatt advanced combustion turbines from <ORGANIZATION>Florida Power & Light Co.</ORGANIZATION> and for two 300-megawatt plants from <ORGANIZATION>Intercontinental Energy Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, among others. 
<LOCATION>Westinghouse</LOCATION>'s plant will provide electrical power to the <ORGANIZATION>Southern California Edison Co.</ORGANIZATION> and backup power and steam to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Borax & Chemical Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
At the same time, <ORGANIZATION>Westinghouse</ORGANIZATION> hopes its venture with <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi</ORGANIZATION> will help fend off growing competition, particularly in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, from such European competitors as <ORGANIZATION>Asea Brown Boveri AG</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Siemens AG</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>British General Electric Co</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Westinghouse</ORGANIZATION> also jointly will bid on projects with <ORGANIZATION>Misubishi</ORGANIZATION>, giving it an edge in developing <LOCATION>Asian</LOCATION> markets.
"Even though we'll still compete against <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi</ORGANIZATION>, we can also work jointly on some projects, and we'll gain a lot of sourcing flexibility," <PERSON>Mr. Stern</PERSON> contends. 
Westinghouse carefully crafted the agreement because the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> earlier this year successfully challenged a proposed steam turbine joint venture with <PERSON>Asea Brown Boveri</PERSON>. 
Despite shutdowns of the company's Lester and <LOCATION>East Pittsburgh</LOCATION> plants, the company believes it has sufficient capacity to meet near-term demand with its much smaller and more efficient manufacturing facilities in <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Crossland Savings Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s stock plummeted after management recommended a suspension of dividend payments on both its common and preferred stock because <PERSON>Crossland</PERSON> may not meet the new government capital criteria effective Dec. 7. 
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> Friday, <ORGANIZATION>Crossland</ORGANIZATION> closed at $5.25, down $1.875, a 26% decline. 
<ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor's Corp.</ORGANIZATION> lowered the rating on <LOCATION>Crossland</LOCATION>'s preferred stock to double-C from single-B-minus and placed it on <ORGANIZATION>CreditWatch</ORGANIZATION> for possible further downgrade.
It also placed on <ORGANIZATION>CreditWatch</ORGANIZATION> for possible downgrade other securities, including the double-B-minus/B rating of <LOCATION>Crossland</LOCATION>'s certificates of deposit and the single-B rating of its senior subordinated capital notes.
"This seed's not grown anywhere else in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, or anywhere else in the world," says <PERSON>T.V. Krishnamurthy</PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Procter & Gamble India Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a major psyllium buyer and promoter. "The proper climatic conditions don't exist in many places in the world." <PERSON>Arvind Patel</PERSON>, a processor and exporter of the seed, raves: "If psyllium takes the place of oat bran, it will be huge." 
Whether psyllium makes <ORGANIZATION>Sidhpur</ORGANIZATION>'s fortune depends on cholesterol-fearing Americans, the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION> and, of course, the outcome of further research.
Only one thing is certain here: <LOCATION>Pysllium</LOCATION> is likely to remain solely an export item from <LOCATION>Sidhpur</LOCATION> for a long time.
As such, the soluble fiber has an almost fanatic following in northern <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. "I can assure you," attests a 25-year-old lawyer in <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, with a meaningfully raised eyebrow, "from personal experience, it works." A prominent businessman in <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION> gives a similar testimonial: "I have been taking it daily since 1961." Folk doctors also prescribe it for kidney, bladder and urethra problems, duodenal ulcers and hemorrhoids.
For decades, psyllium husk has been the main ingredient in such laxatives as <ORGANIZATION>Procter & Gamble Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Metamucil</ORGANIZATION>, the top-selling brand in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Ciba-Geigy Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's Fiberall.
In late 1987, <ORGANIZATION>P&G</ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> for approval to market <ORGANIZATION>Metamucil</ORGANIZATION> as the first non-prescription, cholesterol-lowering product in the 
In September, <ORGANIZATION>Kellogg Co.</ORGANIZATION> launched a competing psyllium-fortified cereal called <ORGANIZATION>Heartwise</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> has asked <PERSON>Kellogg</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>General Mills</ORGANIZATION> to show research that their cereals are safe.
"It's going to be a sensational thing," says <PERSON>Mr. Krishnamurthy</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>P&G</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION>.
Says psyllium exporter <PERSON>Mr. Patel</PERSON>: "I just got back yesterday from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
"Psyllium's not a good crop," complains <PERSON>Sooraji Jath</PERSON>, a 26-year-old farmer from the village of <LOCATION>Lakshmipura</LOCATION>. "You get a rain at the wrong time and the crop is ruined." 
Even at the <ORGANIZATION>Basic Chemicals</ORGANIZATION>, Pharmaceuticals and <ORGANIZATION>Cosmetics Export Promotion Council</ORGANIZATION>, the government agency that promotes the seed, the psyllium boom is distant thunder.
Small crops are grown in <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, but their quality can't compare to that of Indian psyllium. 
Big buyers like <ORGANIZATION>Procter & Gamble</ORGANIZATION> say there are other spots on the globe, and in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, where the seed could be grown. "It's not a crop that can't be doubled or tripled," says <PERSON>Mr. Krishnamurthy</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr. Jath</PERSON> is thinking of passing up psyllium altogether this year in favor of a crop with a future such as cumin or fennel. "Maybe I'll plant castor-oil seeds." His brother, <LOCATION>Parkhaji</LOCATION>, whose head is swathed in a gorgeous crimson turban, nods vigorous assent. 
The offer was automatically triggered by the recent sale of <ORGANIZATION>Control Data</ORGANIZATION>'s Imprimis disk-drive business to <ORGANIZATION>Seagate Technology Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
He said the company has no intention of tapping its short-term bank lines "for a good part of 1990." Sometime next year, <ORGANIZATION>Control Data</ORGANIZATION> will "develop a new bank relationship," <PERSON>Mr. Perlman</PERSON> said.
In recent months a group of lenders, led by <ORGANIZATION>Bank of America</ORGANIZATION>, has extended <ORGANIZATION>Control Data</ORGANIZATION> up to $90 million in revolving loans through January, as well as $115 million in standby letters of credit. 
While a few assets are still being shopped -- including the sports and entertainment ticketing portion of the company's <ORGANIZATION>Ticketron</ORGANIZATION> unit -- <PERSON>Mr. Price</PERSON> said future restructuring would be a question of strategy. "We don't need the cash." 
Rather, <PERSON>Mr. Perlman</PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION>Control Data</ORGANIZATION> intends to bid for the coming <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> lottery contract and is seeking new applications for the technology overseas, where "there is great interest in games of skill." He wouldn't elaborate. 
<ORGANIZATION>Control Data</ORGANIZATION>'s semiconductor business, <ORGANIZATION>VTC Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, continues to lose money, the executives acknowledged, but they said they consider some of the technology vital to national defense and so are reluctant to dispose of it. 
<ORGANIZATION>Control Data</ORGANIZATION> recently announced an agreement with <ORGANIZATION>MIPS Computer Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION> to jointly develop machines with simplified operating software. 
<PERSON>James E. Ousley</PERSON>, computer products group president, said such arrangements could help slash <ORGANIZATION>Control Data</ORGANIZATION>'s computer research and development costs in half by the end of 1990.
He disclosed that before <ORGANIZATION>Control Data</ORGANIZATION> scrapped its <ORGANIZATION>ETA Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION> supercomputer business this past spring, those costs were running at nearly 35% of group revenue.
<PERSON>Perlman</PERSON> nor Price said he spends much time considering the possibility of a hostile takeover. "We've been listed as a candidate for so long it's not worth worrying about," said <PERSON>Mr. Price</PERSON>. 
Just clobbered," said <PERSON>Ulric Weil</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Weil & Associates</ORGANIZATION> who had once been high on the company. "The quarter was terrible, and the future looks anything but encouraging." 
Still, <ORGANIZATION>Unisys</ORGANIZATION> said its European business was weak during the quarter, a worrisome sign given that the company has relied on solid results overseas to overcome weakness in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> over the past several quarters. 
<PERSON>Jim Unruh</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Unisys</ORGANIZATION>'s president, said he is approaching next year with caution.
So <PERSON>Steve Milunovich</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION> said he is cutting his earnings estimate for next year to $2 a share from $3. "I was feeling like I was too high to begin with," he said. 
Reflecting the concern, <ORGANIZATION>Unisys</ORGANIZATION> stock fell a further 75 cents to $16.25 in composite trading Friday on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Consumers Power Co.</ORGANIZATION>, now the main unit of <ORGANIZATION>CMS Energy</ORGANIZATION>, ran into financial problems over its $4.2 billion <LOCATION>Midland</LOCATION> nuclear plant, which was abandoned as a nuclear facility in 1984 because of construction delays and high costs.
For one of the superstars of glasnost, <PERSON>Vitaly Korotich</PERSON>, editor of the trail-blazing weekly <LOCATION>Ogonyok</LOCATION>, Friday, Oct. 20 was a somersaulting day that turned from tension to elation. 
Why had <PERSON>Mr. Korotich</PERSON> been called? "I told my driver," he said, "that he was taking my butt to the <ORGANIZATION>Central Committee</ORGANIZATION> so they can . . ." whack, whack, whack his hand made vigorous spanking gestures on his left palm. "They feel the need from time to time to `educate' me." 
Anxious allies of President <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON> are cautioning media leaders to take it easy, to be careful not to do anything that could be used by <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON>'s opponents.
According to <PERSON>Mr. Korotich</PERSON>, who was present, <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON>'s publicized tongue-lashing of the press on Oct. 13 was more of a plea: "Be careful boys; use good judgment.
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and northern European diplomats confirm <PERSON>Mr. Korotich</PERSON>'s assessment that glasnost is in no immediate danger.
The day after that conversation at the residence of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ambassador, the Brezhnevite editor of Pravda, <PERSON>Victor Afnasjev</PERSON>, was replaced by a college classmate of <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON>'s.
At the end of the very week in which <PERSON>Mr. Korotich</PERSON> was called to the <ORGANIZATION>Central Committee</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Ogonyok</ORGANIZATION> was again demonstrating its independence by printing a poll that showed that 35% of the Soviet population, a plurality, believed that <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON>'s economic reforms, perestroika, would result in only insignificant change. 
Prevented by the <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> from getting on its slate of nominees for the new Supreme Soviet, he stood as an independent candidate for <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> from his native <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> and won with 84% of the vote.
<PERSON>Will Ogonyok</PERSON> begin a series of reports analyzing the failures of perestroika? "I'd be destroying myself," replies <PERSON>Mr. Korotich</PERSON>, who then asks, "What would that accomplish?" His answer reveals his vulnerability -- it also draws the line that Soviet society must cross to enter the normal dialogue of <LOCATION>Western</LOCATION> culture.
<PERSON>Mr. Ayers</PERSON> is editor and publisher of the <LOCATION>Anniston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, Star. 
<ORGANIZATION>Adolph Coors Co.</ORGANIZATION> said its <ORGANIZATION>Coors Brewing Co.</ORGANIZATION> unit will test market a new line of bottled water in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> beginning early next year. 
Perrier, sold by <ORGANIZATION>Perrier Group of America</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Source Perrier S.A. of Paris</ORGANIZATION>, and Evian, sold by a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unit <ORGANIZATION>BSN</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, are distributed to urban areas nationally, but are less available in rural communities.
The company said the water will be called <ORGANIZATION>Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water</ORGANIZATION> and will come from the same mountain spring as water used in <ORGANIZATION>Coors</ORGANIZATION> beer.
The test markets, though not specified, will be in northern <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, some of the hottest bottled-water markets. 
<ORGANIZATION>PWA Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it plans to sell by spring 1992 all 15 passenger planes it acquired earlier this year in its 248 million Canadian dollar (US$211.6 million) purchase of <ORGANIZATION>Wardair Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>PWA</ORGANIZATION>, which recently merged <ORGANIZATION>Wardair</ORGANIZATION>'s operations with those of PWA-owned <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Airlines International Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s second-biggest airline, said the proposed sale is part of a revised five-year plan aimed at streamlining its fleet and shedding debt. 
<ORGANIZATION>PWA</ORGANIZATION> wouldn't estimate the value of <ORGANIZATION>Wardair</ORGANIZATION>'s aircraft, which include 12 Airbus A310-300s and three <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> 747-100s.
But <PERSON>James Ireland</PERSON>, a Miami-based technical analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Avmark Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, an aircraft evaluation firm, estimated the total "half-life" value of the 15 planes at about $650 million or more. 
<PERSON>Mr. Ireland</PERSON> said 11 DC10-30 aircraft that <ORGANIZATION>PWA</ORGANIZATION> also said it plans to sell, beginning in 1992, have a current half-life value of about $34 million each, or a total $374 million, raising aggregate potential proceeds from the aircraft sale to about $1.02 billion. 
Under its revised fleet plan, <ORGANIZATION>PWA</ORGANIZATION> said it will also increase its existing fleet of eight <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> 767-300ER aircraft to 18 by 1994, and add four more <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> 747-400s by 1994 to the two units that it previously planned to add by next year.
<ORGANIZATION>PWA</ORGANIZATION> said two of the <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> 767-300ER aircraft scheduled for delivery in 1990 would be leased out for two to five years. 
<ORGANIZATION>PWA</ORGANIZATION> didn't disclose the expected net cost of the fleet overhaul, but a Toronto-based analyst estimated it at about $450 million (<LOCATION>US</LOCATION>), excluding replacement costs for the 11 DC10-30 aircraft that <ORGANIZATION>PWA</ORGANIZATION> plans to sell, and purchase costs for as many as 17 <ORGANIZATION>Airbus</ORGANIZATION> 320-200 aircraft that <ORGANIZATION>PWA</ORGANIZATION> previously ordered. 
<ORGANIZATION>PWA</ORGANIZATION>'s long-term debt and capital lease obligations rose to C$1.24 billion at the end of the second quarter, nearly double the year-earlier figure, reflecting debt absorbed under the <ORGANIZATION>Wardair</ORGANIZATION> purchase. 
<ORGANIZATION>PWA</ORGANIZATION> said it also expects to announce by Tuesday whether it will take delivery of all 17 <ORGANIZATION>Airbus</ORGANIZATION> 320-200 aircraft it previously ordered.
<PERSON>Mr. Breeden</PERSON>, in his first testimony to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> since taking the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> post, said the agency is studying the Friday the 13th market plunge, including how current circuit breakers affected the market that day and the following Monday.
Rep. <PERSON>Edward Markey</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>), chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee</ORGANIZATION>, is pushing the idea of a circuit breaker for computer-driven program trading in hopes that would curb "turmoil" in the marketplace.
<PERSON>Mr. Breeden</PERSON> backed most of the provisions in a market-reform bill that the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> brought to the subcommittee last year under then-chairman <PERSON>David Ruder</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr. Breeden</PERSON> contended that uncertainty over when the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> might act could worsen volatility in the markets.
The Canadian government, with a view to becoming more politically active in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>, is expected to announce tomorrow its application to join the Organization of <LOCATION>American States</LOCATION>, a Washington-based regional agency. 
The expected <LOCATION>Canadian</LOCATION> move has been welcomed by the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration even though <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> has opposed such <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> actions as the trade embargo against <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>, the invasion of <LOCATION>Grenada</LOCATION> and the military support for <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Contra</ORGANIZATION> guerrillas. 
<LOCATION>Latin American</LOCATION> countries have long urged <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> to join the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> in the hopes that it would be a counterweight to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, which for many years tended to dominate the 32-nation organization. 
Even though the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> also has supported Canadian membership, it hasn't been a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> priority. "The fact that we might not side with the Americans may be a reason why <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s membership in the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> hasn't been, over the years, an item high on the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> agenda," said <PERSON>Allan Gotlieb</PERSON>, former <LOCATION>Canadian</LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
The Canadian application is expected to be announced in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>, by Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON>Brian Mulroney</PERSON>, who is attending a centenary celebration of <LOCATION>Costa Rican</LOCATION> democracy. "<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> has a larger and more beneficial role to play in the hemisphere," <PERSON>Mr. Mulroney</PERSON> said recently. 
Some Canadian political commentators have opposed <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s joining what they see as a U.S.-dominated organization. "Canada could do plenty of things to get serious about <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> without running the risk of getting caught in the cross fire" between the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Latin American members of the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Jeffrey Simpson</PERSON>, a columnist in <ORGANIZATION>Toronto's Globe & Mail</ORGANIZATION> newspaper. 
<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, at times, could be an awkward <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> partner for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> if its <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> voting record is an indication.
In <ORGANIZATION>U.N. General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> votes last year, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> voted the same as the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> only 63% of the time.
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> voted the same as the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 76% of the time, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> 79% and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> 83%. 
<PERSON>Larry Birns</PERSON>, director of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION>Council on Hemispheric Affairs</ORGANIZATION>, a liberal research group, said that <LOCATION>Latin American</LOCATION> countries would be "profoundly disappointed" if <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> were to follow the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> lead in the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>. "Latin Americans see <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> as a non-interventionist power that respects their sovereignty," he said. 
The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>, which tries to promote peace and economic development within the <LOCATION>Americas</LOCATION>, is attempting to find a settlement of the current <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> political crisis.
<LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> has been suspended from <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> membership, but the organization's members are discussing <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>'s reinstatement. 
<ORGANIZATION>PRIMERICA Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, raised its quarterly 14% to eight cents a share, from seven cents, payable Nov. 24 to stock of record Nov. 6.
I read the exerpts of <PERSON>Wayne Angell</PERSON>'s exchange with a <ORGANIZATION>Gosbank</ORGANIZATION> representative ("Put the Soviet Economy on Golden Rails," editorial page, Oct. 5) with great interest, since the gold standard is one of my areas of research.
<PERSON>Mr. Angell</PERSON> is incorrect when he states that the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>'s large gold reserves would give it "great power to establish credibility." During the latter part of the 19th century, <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> was on a gold standard and had gold reserves representing more than 100% of its outstanding currency, but no one outside <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> used rubles. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Bank of England</ORGANIZATION>, on the other hand, had gold reserves that averaged about 30% of its outstanding currency, and <ORGANIZATION>Bank of England</ORGANIZATION> notes were accepted throughout the world.
The most likely reason for this disparity is that the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of England</ORGANIZATION> was a private bank with substantial earning assets, and the common-law rights of creditors to collect claims against the bank were well established in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
By contrast, in 19th-century <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> an authoritarian government owned the bank and had the power to revoke payment whenever it chose, much as it would in today's <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>. 
It is no coincidence that from 1844 to 1914, when the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of England</ORGANIZATION> was an independent private bank, the pound was never devalued and payment of gold for pound notes was never suspended, but with the subsequent nationalization of the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of England</ORGANIZATION>, the pound was devalued with increasing frequency and its use as an international medium of exchange declined. 
One way to make the ruble into a major international currency would be to leave reserves of gold and earning assets in a <LOCATION>Swiss</LOCATION> bank with distributions based on <LOCATION>Swiss</LOCATION> laws.
<PERSON>David Evans</PERSON>, who last week resigned as president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Entertainment Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "for personal reasons" just as the company filed for bankruptcy-law protection, has been temporarily reappointed to both positions, the company said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Qintex Entertainment</ORGANIZATION> also said Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer <PERSON>Jonathan Lloyd</PERSON>, 37 years old, would join the nine-member board.
He succeeds <PERSON>Roger Kimmel</PERSON>, who resigned last week saying his participation in evaluating the company's role in buying <ORGANIZATION>MGM/UA Communications Co.</ORGANIZATION> was no longer necessary. 
It was the 49-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Evans</PERSON> who had moved into the offices of <LOCATION>MGM/UA</LOCATION> and run the company during <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Australia Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> 's aborted bid for the movie company.
And the relationship between <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Entertainment</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Australian</LOCATION> company appears to be quickly deteriorating. 
On Oct. 19, <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Entertainment</ORGANIZATION> was about to default on a $5.9 million payment owed to <ORGANIZATION>MCA Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in connection with the distribution of a television program.
<ORGANIZATION>Qintex Entertainment</ORGANIZATION> was depending on <LOCATION>Qintex Australia</LOCATION> to arrange financing.
But early on Oct. 19, the second of two hectic days of board meetings, <PERSON>Mr. Evans</PERSON> said he believed Qintex <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> wouldn't be forthcoming.
He recommended that the company file for protection under Chapter 11 of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Bankruptcy Code before the <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> deadline, according to a source familiar with the sessions. 
Separately, a <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Entertainment</ORGANIZATION> shareholder filed suit in federal court in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> charging Qintex <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> with misleading shareholders about <ORGANIZATION>Qintex Entertainment</ORGANIZATION>'s financial position.
ARTICLE I, SECTION 7, CLAUSE 2: Every Bill which shall have passed the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, shall, before it becomes a Law, be presented to the President of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it.
If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, it shall become a Law. . . . 
ARTICLE I, SECTION 7, CLAUSE 3: Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION>, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill. 
Vice President <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> and Budget Director <PERSON>Darman</PERSON> said recently they've joined the search.
<PERSON>Mr. Glazier</PERSON> discovered that the <ORGANIZATION>Founders</ORGANIZATION> had worried that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> might take the President out of the loop.
The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> had the perfect case, but <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> blinked before it could go to court.
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> inserted the following into the <ORGANIZATION>Interior</ORGANIZATION> appropriation: "None of the funds available under this title may be used to prepare reports on contacts between employees of the Dept. of the <ORGANIZATION>Interior</ORGANIZATION> and Members and committees of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and their staff." 
The fear <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> has of any line-item-veto test led Members to add the single most contorted and ridiculous provision this year, "This section shall be effective only on Oct. 1, 1989." This means <ORGANIZATION>Interior</ORGANIZATION> contacts cannot be logged only on one day -- a Sunday that had already passed. 
If the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> is looking for another unconstitutional bill, Rep. <PERSON>John Dingell</PERSON> is trying again to raise the Fairness Doctrine from the dead.
Commenting on the budget mess this week, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said: "The perception out there is that it's the fault of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> is in no position to naysay <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> now that we're into <PERSON>Gramm-Rudman</PERSON>'s sequestration.
Senator <PERSON>Daniel Inouye</PERSON> agreed to close some bases in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> in exchange for such goodies as $11 million for a parking lot at Walter <ORGANIZATION>Reed Hospital</ORGANIZATION>.
Conference negotiator Rep. <PERSON>Bill Hefner</PERSON> pulled down $40 million in military bases for <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> and graciously allowed Senator <PERSON>James Sasser</PERSON> $70 million for bases in <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>.
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has the power to change how <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> works, if only he will use it. 
Delmed, which makes and sells peritoneal dialysis products used in treating kidney disease, on Tuesday announced the resignations of <PERSON>Robert S. Ehrlich</PERSON>, chairman, president and chief executive officer, and of <PERSON>Leslie I. Shapiro</PERSON>, chief operating officer and chief financial officer.
They were succeeded by executives of <ORGANIZATION>Fresenius USA Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and its parent, <ORGANIZATION>Fresenius AG</ORGANIZATION>, which owns about 45% of Delmed. 
At the same time, the <LOCATION>New Brunswick</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, company said negotiations about pricing and volumes of product had collapsed between it and its exclusive distributor in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>National Medical Care Inc</ORGANIZATION>. Following that announcement Tuesday, however, company officials were unavailable to elaborate. 
Yesterday, the spokeswoman said sales of Delmed products through the exclusive arrangement with <ORGANIZATION>National Medical</ORGANIZATION> accounted for 87% of <ORGANIZATION>Delmed</ORGANIZATION>'s 1988 sales of $21.1 million.
The current distribution arrangement ends in March 1990, although <ORGANIZATION>Delmed</ORGANIZATION> said it will continue to provide some supplies of the peritoneal dialysis products to <ORGANIZATION>National Medical</ORGANIZATION>, the spokeswoman said. 
<PERSON>Delmed</PERSON> said yesterday that <ORGANIZATION>Fresenius USA</ORGANIZATION> would begin distributing the product and that the company is investigating other possible distribution channels.
Another option for <ORGANIZATION>Delmed</ORGANIZATION>, the company said, is that it could sell its plant in <LOCATION>Ogden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Kyle Technology Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said a <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> investor has signed a letter of intent to buy the company for about $3.1 million, or $1.20 a share. 
The investor, <PERSON>Donald A. Wright</PERSON>, plans to run the company, said a spokesman for <PERSON>Kyle</PERSON>. 
One of the more bizarre garden stories since <PERSON>Eden</PERSON> has been unfolding for four years now, in the private paper-and-crayon fantasies of artist <PERSON>Jennifer Bartlett</PERSON>.
South Gardens, as the <PERSON>Bartlett</PERSON> scheme is called, will occupy the last 3.5 acres of open space at the southwest tip of <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>.
Last year she boasted to HG magazine: "I'd never looked at a garden in my life." And she proved no shirking violet in her initial statement to the <ORGANIZATION>BPCA</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York State</LOCATION> public benefit corporation: "The only thing I was interested in doing was a very complicated garden, which would cost an enormous amount of money and be very expensive to maintain." 
Undeterred, the <ORGANIZATION>BPCA</ORGANIZATION> hired <PERSON>Ms. Bartlett</PERSON> and another confessed garden ignoramus, the architect <PERSON>Alexander Cooper</PERSON>, who claimed he had never visited, much less built, a garden, and said of the project, "I don't view this as a landscape.
The firm of <ORGANIZATION>Bruce Kelly/David Varnell Landscape Architects</ORGANIZATION> had created Central Park's <PERSON>Strawberry Fields</PERSON> and Shakespeare Garden.
And she further stunned her listeners by revealing her secret garden design method: Commissioning a friend to spend "five or six thousand dollars . . . on books that I ultimately cut up." After that, the layout had been easy. "I've always relied heavily on the grid and found it never to fail." <PERSON>Ms. Bartlett</PERSON> told her audience that she absolutely did not believe in compromise or in giving in to the client "because I don't think you can do watered-down versions of things." (This was never a problem with South Gardens, because the client had long since given in to <PERSON>Ms. Bartlett</PERSON>'s every whim.) 
Last year the public was afforded a preview of <PERSON>Ms. Bartlett</PERSON>'s creation in a tablemodel version, at a <ORGANIZATION>BPC</ORGANIZATION> exhibition.
In another compartment called the <LOCATION>Linden Bosque</LOCATION>, 62 linden trees were to be crowded together at killing intervals of 10 or 16 feet. (<ORGANIZATION>Lindens</ORGANIZATION> need about 36 feet.) 
Finally, flouting the <ORGANIZATION>BPCA</ORGANIZATION>'s wishes to continue the popular two-mile riverside <ORGANIZATION>Esplanade</ORGANIZATION>, prized for its expansive views of <LOCATION>New York Harbor</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Statue of Liberty</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Ellis Island</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Ms. Bartlett</PERSON> threw up yet another wall, this time concrete, this time 10 1/2 feet tall.
The <ORGANIZATION>Parks Council</ORGANIZATION> wrote the <ORGANIZATION>BPCA</ORGANIZATION> that this "too `private' . . . exclusive," complex and expensive "enclosed garden . . . belongs in almost any location but the waterfront." <PERSON>Lynden B. Miller</PERSON>, the noted public garden designer who restored Central Park's Conservatory Garden, recalls her reaction to the South Gardens model in light of the public garden she was designing for 42nd Street's Bryant Park: "Bryant Park, as designed in 1933, failed as a public space, because it made people feel trapped.
The three urban horticulture experts with <ORGANIZATION>Cornell Cooperative Extension</ORGANIZATION> weighed in with a letter to the <ORGANIZATION>BPCA</ORGANIZATION> that began: "We feel that the garden is horticulturally doomed." They then addressed the decidedly "questionable safety of . . . a complex garden of endless hiding places.
The 8 ft. hedges which obstruct views in and out of small `rooms' insure . . . that this garden will be a potential breeding ground for crime." (At <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Ms. Bartlett</PERSON> had declared: "There are going to be problems with safety . . . I'm not going to address questions of safety!") 
These statesmen might take counsel from <PERSON>William Robinson</PERSON>, author of "The English Flower Garden" -- the gardener's bible since 1883 -- who seems to have had a <PERSON>Jennifer Bartlett</PERSON> in mind when he wrote: "Unhappily, our gardeners for ages have suffered at the hands of the decorative artist when applying his `designs' to the garden. . . . It is this adapting of absurd `knots' and patterns from old books to any surface where a flower garden has to be made that leads to bad and frivolous design -- wrong in plan and hopeless for the life of plants." 
Wall Street executives said they believed that <ORGANIZATION>Renaissance</ORGANIZATION>'s $900 million buy program was carried out by <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
Renaissance's last portfolio shift, carried out by <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, was a highly publicized decision last January to sell its entire stock portfolio and buy <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bills.
The sell signal, which sent a bearish chill through the stock market, came when <ORGANIZATION>Renaissance</ORGANIZATION>'s computer found that stocks were overpriced compared with bonds and <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bills. 
So why does <ORGANIZATION>Renaissance</ORGANIZATION>'s computer like stocks with the <ORGANIZATION>Dow</ORGANIZATION> at 2653.28, where it closed yesterday, when it didn't with the <ORGANIZATION>Dow</ORGANIZATION> at 2200? 
<PERSON>Mr. Terrizzi</PERSON> confirms some clients have left <ORGANIZATION>Renaissance</ORGANIZATION>, but no major ones, and the firm has added new accounts. 
The latest quarter's results, however, included a pretax gain of $13.7 million, or 20 cents a share, in the carrying value of the company's investment in <ORGANIZATION>Conner Peripherals Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and a $7.6 million gain, or 11 cents a share, from the sale of one million <ORGANIZATION>Conner</ORGANIZATION> shares. 
<PERSON>Michael Swavely</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Compaq's North America</ORGANIZATION> division, attributed the company's third-quarter performance to continued increases in international sales, which accounted for 43% of the company's sales, a 74% increase from a year earlier. 
During the third quarter, <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION> purchased a former <ORGANIZATION>Wang Laboratories</ORGANIZATION> manufacturing facility in <LOCATION>Stirling</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>, which will be used for international service and repair operations.
<PERSON>Mr. Swavely</PERSON> said the new space will allow <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION> to increase the manufacturing capacity of its plant in <LOCATION>Erskine</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION> shares fell $1.625 to $108.625. 
Leveraged funds in particular "are still extremely vulnerable, because we're still at the beginning of problems in the junk market," says <PERSON>George Foot</PERSON>, a managing partner at <ORGANIZATION>Newgate Management Associates</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Northampton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>. 
Many investors are unaware their funds have borrowed to speculate in such a risky market. "If someone actually sat down and thought about what they were being sold," says <PERSON>Gerald Perritt</PERSON>, editor of the Mutual Fund Letter in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, they might shy away. 
<PERSON>Carl Ericson</PERSON>, who runs the <ORGANIZATION>Colonial Intermediate High Income Fund</ORGANIZATION>, says the fund's 25% leverage has jacked up its interest income. "As long as I am borrowing at 9.9% and each {bond} yields over that, it enhances the yield," he maintains.
"We are trying to increase our flexibility," says <PERSON>Ellen E. Terry</PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Ostrander Capital Management</ORGANIZATION>, the fund's investment adviser.
<ORGANIZATION>Prospect Street High Income Portfolio</ORGANIZATION>, for instance, now holds about 15% in cash and equivalents, nearly quintuple the amount it held earlier this year, says <PERSON>John Frabotta</PERSON>, portfolio co-manager.
At the 50%-leveraged <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> Income Fund, portfolio manager <PERSON>John Bianchi</PERSON> recently dumped <ORGANIZATION>Mesa Petroleum</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Wickes</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Horsehead Industries</ORGANIZATION>, among others, to raise his cash position to a record 15%. 
"We're looking at the leverage factor every day," says <PERSON>Robert Moore</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Bernstein-Macaulay Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ORGANIZATION> unit and the fund's adviser. "At some point, if we are unable to cover our leveraged cost -- and at the moment we're right on it -- we're going to have to make a move." 
Long-term <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bonds rose slightly despite the arrival on the market of $4.52 billion in 30-year bonds offered by the <ORGANIZATION>Resolution Funding Corp.</ORGANIZATION> as part of the government's bailout of the savings and loan industry.
Bond investors paid close attention to comments by <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Alan Greenspan</PERSON>, who was testifying before a congressional hearing, but weren't able to extract many clues about the future course of the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>'s monetary policy.
In late <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> trading the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> currency was quoted at 1.8353 marks and 141.52 yen, compared with 1.8355 marks and 141.45 yen Tuesday. 
He is president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Comerica Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>. 
The proposal, however, was immediately rebuffed by <PERSON>Arby</PERSON>'s parent, <ORGANIZATION>DWG Corp.</ORGANIZATION> "Arby's isn't for sale," said <PERSON>Renee Mottram</PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION>DWG</ORGANIZATION>. 
The new suitor, <ORGANIZATION>Stevric Equity Ventures Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>Mineola</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, characterized its proposal as the "first truly independent offer which does not pit one interest group against another within the Arby's franchisee community." 
In September, <ORGANIZATION>DWG</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Miami Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, holding company controlled by financeer <PERSON>Victor Posner</PERSON>, rejected an offer from a group of <ORGANIZATION>Arby</ORGANIZATION>'s franchisees to acquire <PERSON>Arby</PERSON>'s for $200 million.
<PERSON>Stevric</PERSON>'s principals, <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> and <PERSON>Steven Buckley</PERSON>, said they led the acquisition group that acquired the <ORGANIZATION>Nathan's Famous Inc.</ORGANIZATION> restaurant chain and subsequently served as the top officers of the company.
<PERSON>Richard Buckley</PERSON> said <PERSON>Stevric</PERSON>'s acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Arby</ORGANIZATION>'s "would allow seasoned franchisers and food-service operators, with no conflicts of interest, to stabilize franchisee relations and properly refocus the company's energies toward growth." 
As part of the move, its affiliated <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> company, <ORGANIZATION>International Components Technology Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, purchased a <LOCATION>Mexican</LOCATION> plant formerly belonging to <ORGANIZATION>KSI Disc Products Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
Together with two existing plants in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Furukawa</ORGANIZATION> said it will expand its current local monthly production of memory disks to 1.4 million sheets from 800,000.
In <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Furukawa</ORGANIZATION> said it will raise production at a plant outside <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> to 300,000 sheets monthly from 100,000. 
<ORGANIZATION>Furukawa</ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market is strengthening as related computer technology gains in sophistication and quality. 
Friday, Oct. 27, 9 p.m.-midnight EDT, on <ORGANIZATION>PBS</ORGANIZATION> (PBS air dates and times vary, so check local listings): "Show Boat." <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey's Paper Mill Playhouse</ORGANIZATION> produced this faithful revival of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s most influential musical, written by <PERSON>Jerome Kern</PERSON> and <PERSON>Oscar Hammerstein</PERSON> and first produced on Broadway in 1927.

Sunday, Oct. 29, 10-11 p.m. EST, on Showtime (repeated Nov. 2, 6, 11 and 15): "The Strange Case of <PERSON>Dr. Jekyll</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Hyde</PERSON>." Fans of <PERSON>Anthony Andrews</PERSON> ("Brideshead Revisited") will relish watching him play the title role(s) in the 19th-century <PERSON>Robert Louis Stevenson</PERSON> pre-Freudian drama of schizoid horror. 
Wednesday, Nov. 1, 9-10:30 p.m. EST, on PBS: "Thomas <PERSON>Hart Benton</PERSON>." Critical opinion is divided about the success of <LOCATION>Benton</LOCATION>'s populist defiance of modernist art.
But no one could disagree that <PERSON>Ken Burns</PERSON> has made a fascinating film about this famous <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> painter. 
Thursday, Nov. 2, 9-10 p.m. EST, on A&E (repeated at 1 a.m. and on Nov. 5): "Third and Oak: The Pool Hall."

One reason for its downfall was the murder trial of <PERSON>D.C. Stephenson</PERSON>, an <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> leader whose reckless career is depicted in this film starring <PERSON>Mel Harris</PERSON> ("thirtysomething") and <PERSON>John Heard</PERSON>. 
Tuesday, Nov. 7, 8-9 p.m. EST, on PBS: "Hurricane!" Has the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> earthquake caused you to forget <PERSON>Hugo</PERSON>?
The filing, made yesterday in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Bankruptcy Court</ORGANIZATION> here, follows an agreement by <ORGANIZATION>L.J. Hooker Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Merksamer</ORGANIZATION>'s owner, to sell the chain to management for an undisclosed price.
<ORGANIZATION>GE Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a financial services subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION>, is providing <ORGANIZATION>Merksamer</ORGANIZATION> management with $15 million in financing. 
<ORGANIZATION>L.J. Hooker</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, filed for Chapter 11 protection in August and has also announced its intention to sell its <ORGANIZATION>B. Altman & Co.</ORGANIZATION> department store chain.
<ORGANIZATION>L.J. Hooker</ORGANIZATION> is owned by <ORGANIZATION>Hooker Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, which itself is currently being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator. 
<ORGANIZATION>L.J. Hooker</ORGANIZATION>'s planned sale of Merksamer is subject to approval by <PERSON>Judge Tina Brozman</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Bankruptcy Court</ORGANIZATION>. 
One executive said an accord signed by the unsecured creditors of <ORGANIZATION>L.J. Hooker Corp.</ORGANIZATION> had frozen in place all of <PERSON>L.J. Hooker</PERSON>'s assets. 
The Merksamer bankruptcy-law filing appears to supersede that agreement. "By filing for Chapter 11, the <ORGANIZATION>Merksamer</ORGANIZATION> chain will only need approval from a bankruptcy judge for the sale, not the hundreds of unsecured creditors," said this executive. "The cash from the sale will go to <PERSON>L.J. Hooker</PERSON>, but the company itself will belong to <PERSON>Sam Merksamer</PERSON>." 
<PERSON>Mr. Merksamer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sanford Sigoloff</PERSON>, chief executive of <PERSON>L.J. Hooker</PERSON>, were unavailable for comment.
The jewelry chain, which is based in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, had revenue of $62 million and operating profit of $2.5 million for the year ended June 30. 
In 1985, the <ORGANIZATION>Medical Tribune</ORGANIZATION> reported that a growing number of critics are challenging the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> bioequivalence-therapeutic-equivalence equation. "They contend it is based on an assumption that has not yet been proven in valid tests," the <ORGANIZATION>Tribune</ORGANIZATION> said. 
So much of the stuff poured into its <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, offices that its mail rooms there simply stopped delivering it.
"We just don't have the staff to {deliver} it, nor do we have the space or the time," says a spokesman for the <LOCATION>Schaumburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, electronics company, which has 5,000 employees in the <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION> area. "It's the overload problem and the weight problem we have." 
<ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> earlier this year said it wouldn't deliver bulk mail or free magazines in its Flint, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, office, while <ORGANIZATION>Air Products & Chemicals</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Allentown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, says it screens junk mail and often throws out most of a given mass mailing. 
The practice of businesses throwing out junk mail "is a commonly known problem, and it's increasing as companies attempt to put through budget cuts across the board," right down to the mail-room level, says <PERSON>Stephen Belth</PERSON>, a list consultant and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Direct Marketing Association</ORGANIZATION>'s business-to-business council. "But it's like biting the hand that feeds them, because every one of these companies uses direct marketing." 
<ORGANIZATION>Motorola</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION> operation was one of the first to lose patience, deciding a few years ago to junk any bulk mail that wasn't addressed to an individual.
Direct-mail executives see <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s stand as an ominous sign -- even if the junk-mail kings did bring it on themselves. "Why anyone would want to close themselves off {from direct mail}, a priori, doesn't make any sense," says <PERSON>Michael Bronner</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Bronner Slosberg Associates</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> directmail firm. "It smacks of big brotherism.
<PERSON>Jack Ellis</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> postal inspector in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, says the <ORGANIZATION>Postal Service</ORGANIZATION>'s only job is to deliver the mail to the mail room; once it gets there, a company can do with it what it wishes. 
Among other things, the industry is trying to come up with standardized business lists that cut down on duplications. "We're going to have to mail a lot less and a lot smarter," says <PERSON>Jack Miller</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Quill Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Lincolnshire</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, business-to-business mail-order company.
The ad campaign, created by <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi & Saatchi</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Backer Spielvogel Bates</ORGANIZATION> agency, is an extension of the auto company's "Cars That Make Sense" campaign, which emphasized affordability.
One spot shows a Sonata next to a rival midsized car, and an announcer says, "Listen to what they're saying about the <ORGANIZATION>Hyundai Sonata</ORGANIZATION>." As the announcer reads favorable quotes about the model from <ORGANIZATION>Motor Trend and Road & Track</ORGANIZATION> magazines, the other car, which is white, slowly turns green. "No wonder the competition's green with envy," the announcer says. 
ACQUISITION: <ORGANIZATION>EWDB</ORGANIZATION>, formed by the merger of <ORGANIZATION>Eurocom</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Della Femina McNamee WCRS</ORGANIZATION>, said it agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION>Vizeversa</ORGANIZATION>, an agency in <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION>.
HOLIDAY ADS: <ORGANIZATION>Seagram</ORGANIZATION> will run two interactive ads in December magazines promoting its Chivas Regal and <ORGANIZATION>Crown Royal</ORGANIZATION> brands.
Both ads were designed by <ORGANIZATION>Omnicom</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>DDB Needham</ORGANIZATION> agency. 
That's why "we have been working hard to develop a single, more unified presence in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>," said <PERSON>A.J.C. Smith</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Marsh & McLennan</ORGANIZATION>'s president, at a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> news conference yesterday. 
Analysts speculated that <ORGANIZATION>Marsh & McLennan</ORGANIZATION> would spend between 250 million marks ($136.4 million) and 350 million marks for the rest of <ORGANIZATION>Gradmann & Holler</ORGANIZATION>, or roughly 25 to 30 times the private firm's estimated earnings. "This is paying a big price to maintain their virility as the world's leading insurance broker," said <PERSON>Philip Olsen</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Kitcat & Aitken</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> brokerage firm. 
Earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION>New York Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> agreed to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Windsor Group Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a first step toward establishing a presence in the European market ahead of 1992.
But most <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> insurers haven't rushed to change the way they do business in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> because they believe the European market will still be dominated by a handful of domestic companies. 
Under the proposed combination, <ORGANIZATION>Marsh & McLennan</ORGANIZATION> would gain a majority stake in <ORGANIZATION>Gradmann & Holler</ORGANIZATION> that would increase over time to the rest of the remaining 85%.
The three managing general partners would receive a "significant" number of <ORGANIZATION>Marsh & McLennan</ORGANIZATION> shares, said <PERSON>Walther L. Kiep</PERSON>, a partner who would also join <ORGANIZATION>Marsh & McLennan</ORGANIZATION>'s board. 
<PERSON>Mr. Kiep</PERSON> said he sought the combination because "all our large clients in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> are becoming European companies or multinational companies and they expect an insurance broker" to serve them as well in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> as in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Beatrice E. Garcia</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> contributed to this article. 
The acquisition would give <LOCATION>Wilmington</LOCATION>, Del.-based Star States access to the <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> market. 
<PERSON>Hale Milgrim</PERSON>, 41 years old, senior vice president, marketing at <ORGANIZATION>Elecktra Entertainment Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, was named president of <ORGANIZATION>Capitol Records Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of this entertainment concern.
<PERSON>Mr. Milgrim</PERSON> succeeds <PERSON>David Berman</PERSON>, who resigned last month. 
But the guidelines could "make it impossible to commercialize research," says <PERSON>Kenneth Smith</PERSON>, associate provost and vice president for research at <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>. 
The guidelines could foil future arrangements similar to the deal behind <ORGANIZATION>Lithox Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Salem</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, start-up, says <PERSON>Robert Daly</PERSON>, a managing partner of <ORGANIZATION>TA Associates</ORGANIZATION>, a venture-capital firm.
With $2.3 million, he and other investors launched <ORGANIZATION>Lithox</ORGANIZATION> last year to market a gallstone cure being developed by researchers of the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. 
But because the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, like many other universities, shares its royalties with researchers, it may disqualify itself from federal funds under the proposed guidelines, <PERSON>Mr. Daly</PERSON> says. 
For instance, <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth BioVentures Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a venture-capital concern, last month invested $600,000 to launch <ORGANIZATION>Amira Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Worcester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, concern that will produce pharmaceuticals.
Scientists <PERSON>Rima Kaddurah-Daouk</PERSON> and <PERSON>Paul Schimmel</PERSON> conducted the initial research at the <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>.
While <PERSON>Ms. Kaddurah-Daouk</PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION> to head <LOCATION>Amira</LOCATION>, Prof.
<PERSON>Schimmel</PERSON> will continue to work at <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION>, serve on <ORGANIZATION>Amira</ORGANIZATION>'s board and own a small equity stake in the company. 
While universities develop the basic research, "venture capitalists are the ones best positioned to finance its commercialization," says <PERSON>Gloria W. Doubleday</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION>. "This is the best way to transfer technology straight off the campuses of universities." 
<PERSON>Schimmel</PERSON> from being involved with start-ups such as <LOCATION>Amira</LOCATION>, venture capitalists point out.
In many of these deals, "venture capitalists had the inside track," says <PERSON>Lawrence Bock</PERSON> of Avalon Ventures, <LOCATION>La Jolla</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
Last year, for example, <ORGANIZATION>Avalon</ORGANIZATION> and others invested $14 million in <ORGANIZATION>Athena Neurosciences Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>South San Francisco</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, to license and develop technology for delivery of drugs to the brain.
But before <LOCATION>Athena</LOCATION> was able to get an exclusive license to the technology, the Federal Register published most of the details, "giving all of the company's potential competitors a chance to exploit it," <PERSON>Mr. Bock</PERSON> says.
If start-ups can't have early access to research being conducted at institutions, "we have to replicate it ourselves or do without the research," says <PERSON>Ruth Emyanitoff</PERSON>, manager of business development at <ORGANIZATION>Applied bioTechnology Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, concern.
For its part, <ORGANIZATION>NIH</ORGANIZATION> insists that its guidelines "should not stifle research creativity or technology transfer from the research laboratory to commercial use." Universities such as <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION> should be able to develop a way to act as brokers for the individual scientists, says <PERSON>Katherine Bick</PERSON>, who oversees the huge <ORGANIZATION>NIH</ORGANIZATION> grants program as its deputy director for extramural research. 
<PERSON>Ms. Bick</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>NIH</ORGANIZATION> administrator, says the business and scientific community is overreacting to what the agency merely meant to be "ideas for discussion." The predictions of doom are "premature," she says. 
On Sept. 14, <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> began circulating a conflict-of-interest policy statement that, in effect, would follow the <ORGANIZATION>NIH</ORGANIZATION> guidelines faithfully. 
The <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> is also circulating a memo among its scientific faculty that will restrict contact with the world of business.
The <LOCATION>Wilmington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Del.</LOCATION>, company reported net of $547 million, or $2.36 a share, which was in line with Wall Street estimates.
The dividend increase was <ORGANIZATION>Du Pont</ORGANIZATION>'s second this year, an affirmation of statements by top executives that they intend to increase rewards to shareholders. "We haven't benefited the shareholder as much as we need to," said <PERSON>Edgar Woolard Jr.</PERSON>, <PERSON>Du Pont</PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive officer, in an interview several months before he entered his current position in April. 
The largest beneficiary will be <ORGANIZATION>Seagram Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which owns about 23% of <ORGANIZATION>Du Pont</ORGANIZATION>.
A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Seagram</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> wine and spirits concern controlled by the <PERSON>Bronfman</PERSON> family, said the company will post additional pretax profit of about $33 million a year because of the additional <ORGANIZATION>Du Pont</ORGANIZATION> dividends. 
<ORGANIZATION>Du Pont</ORGANIZATION>'s stock rose $2.50 a share to close at $117.375 in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday.
<ORGANIZATION>Seagram</ORGANIZATION> closed at $84.75, up 12.5 cents a share in <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> trading. 
<PERSON>James Fallon</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New Providence</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, marketing consultant to the chemicals industry, says <ORGANIZATION>Du Pont</ORGANIZATION> still holds an edge in making the pigment because the company was "first in with the technology" to lower costs.
Profit climbed to $98 million from $71 million in the petroleum segment, as <ORGANIZATION>Du Pont</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Conoco Inc.</ORGANIZATION> oil company was helped by crude oil prices higher than a year ago and by higher natural gas prices and volume. 
In the fibers segment, profit rose to $180 million from $155 million, a gain <ORGANIZATION>Du Pont</ORGANIZATION> attributed to higher demand in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> for most textile products. 
The <LOCATION>Floral Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, thrift has a strong capital-to-assets ratio, said Vice President <PERSON>Michael D.N. Confer</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr. Rogers</PERSON>, 60 years old, succeeds <PERSON>J.V. White</PERSON>, 64, who will remain chairman and chairman of the executive committee.
<PERSON>Mr. Rogers</PERSON>, who was president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION>Equifax</ORGANIZATION>, will retain his position as president.
The buy-out group is headed by <PERSON>Paul R. Lederer</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Parker</ORGANIZATION>'s automotive group, and includes several other executives of the three divisions. 
The units are the <ORGANIZATION>Edelmann</ORGANIZATION>, Ideal and <ORGANIZATION>Plews</ORGANIZATION> divisions.
<ORGANIZATION>Hoechst AG</ORGANIZATION>'s Chairman <PERSON>Wolfgang Hilger</PERSON> said the company wants to have a substitute product to completely replace ozone-damaging chlorofluorocarbons by 1995.
In April, <ORGANIZATION>Hoechst</ORGANIZATION>, the largest producer of CFCs in <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, said it wanted to reduce production of the product by 50% by 1993. 
<PERSON>Mr. Hilger</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Hoechst</ORGANIZATION> will invest 50 million marks ($27.2 million) in a plant to make a substitute product it has developed that it says is unchlorinated.
This year, <ORGANIZATION>Hoechst</ORGANIZATION> will produce about 62,000 tons of CFCs in factories in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>. 
This year is the 75th anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve System</ORGANIZATION>, and some members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> think it's time to take a fresh look at the nation's central bank.
In earlier years it may have seemed reasonable to give <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, a bank and allow <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> only a branch of the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> bank, but times have changed.
<PERSON>Carter Glass</PERSON>, a former treasury secretary who was then back in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, probably influenced the decision.
Rep. <PERSON>Byron Dorgan</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>N.D.</LOCATION>) has introduced a bill in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, co-sponsored by Rep. <PERSON>Lee Hamilton</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION>), that would put the treasury secretary back on the board.
That may have pleased the secretary, but <PERSON>H. Erich Heinemann</PERSON>, chief economist of the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION>Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, suggests that <PERSON>Mr. Brady</PERSON> may figure he already has all the power he needs. 
This recommendation might have encouraged a turf-hungry bureaucrat to try to expand his power, but so far <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Alan Greenspan</PERSON> hasn't made a pitch for the job.
In recent weeks, moreover, <PERSON>Mr. Brady</PERSON> has joined other administration officials in trying to urge the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> toward lower interest rates.
In an interview with the <ORGANIZATION>Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> in early October, the secretary said the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> may be slightly more interested in curbing inflation than the administration is, while the administration may put slightly more emphasis on spurring economic growth. 
<PERSON>Allan Meltzer</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Carnegie-Mellon University</ORGANIZATION> economist, noted that the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>'s record included the longest, most sustained, peacetime inflation in our history, dating from either 1966 or 1967 to 1989.
The inflation-growth argument is an old one, but <PERSON>Mr. Brady</PERSON>, on the board or off, is surely trying to influence <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> policy. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> has let interest rates slip slightly, but whether the main reason was dollar intervention, the gloomy reports on manufacturing employment, or the Friday 13 market drop, only <PERSON>Mr. Greenspan</PERSON> and his associates know. 
Earlier this year, <PERSON>Martin Feldstein</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>National Bureau of Economic Research</ORGANIZATION>, argued forcefully that a government that wants steady, stable exchange rates might try some steady stable economic policies.
Call <PERSON>Jim Wright</PERSON>'s office in downtown <LOCATION>Fort Worth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, these days and the receptionist still answers the phone, "Speaker <PERSON>Wright</PERSON>'s office." 
One of the hottest tickets on <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s social calendar this fall was a charity benefit honoring former Congressman <PERSON>Tony Coelho</PERSON>, who landed a million-dollar job on Wall Street after resigning over a controversial junk-bond investment last summer. 
<PERSON>Michael Deaver</PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> aide, has become the most recent addition to the teeming ranks of fallen politicians and officials earning their way as lobbyists and consultants here.
Let the president demand strict new ethics rules: With four sitting <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> members accused of sexual misdeeds, amid the unfolding <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> scandal and after the Wright debacle, "people are slightly dulled by scandal," says political humorist <PERSON>Art Buchwald</PERSON>. "It now takes something really weird to inspire public outrage." 
But many have. "These people bounce back more resiliently than regular people," says <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> writer <PERSON>Suzanne Garment</PERSON>, who is working on a history of post-Watergate scandal. 
"He's as busy as he was as speaker," reports <PERSON>Mr. Wright</PERSON>'s administrative aide, <PERSON>Larry Shannon</PERSON>. 
On the edge of fashionable <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION>, in a chic office with a river view and a number of corporate clients whom he won't name, <PERSON>Mr. Deaver</PERSON> is trying to reclaim his reputation as one of the savviest image makers in town. 
There are few mementos of his days as White House deputy chief of staff and confidant of <PERSON>Ronald</PERSON> and <PERSON>Nancy Reagan</PERSON>.
One sign of <PERSON>Mr. Deaver</PERSON>'s renaissance: an appearance on <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s "Nightline" for a show on pack journalism.
Host <PERSON>Ted Koppel</PERSON> introduced him as "the media master of the <ORGANIZATION>Reagan Administration</ORGANIZATION>," with nary a mention of <PERSON>Mr. Deaver</PERSON>'s conviction in 1987 on perjury charges. 
"When someone says, 'I've turned to God, ' everybody lays off," observes <PERSON>Frank Mankiewicz</PERSON>, an old <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> hand and former aide to <PERSON>Robert Kennedy</PERSON>.
Thus have <PERSON>Charles Colson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jeb Magruder</PERSON> launched successful post-Watergate careers at the pulpit. 
After allegations surfaced in a 1985 divorce contest that he had beaten his wife, <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> enforcement chief <PERSON>John Fedders</PERSON> retreated to a Trappist monastery in rural <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>.
Nobody proved that more masterfully than <PERSON>Mr. Coelho</PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION>Democratic</ORGANIZATION> majority whip.
Among the glitterati who turned out in bipartisan black-tie force to benefit the <ORGANIZATION>Coelho Epilepsy Fund</ORGANIZATION> last month were <PERSON>Sen. Robert Dole</PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON>Newt Gingrich</PERSON>, and other kingpins of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
From his new, million-dollar-a-year perch on Wall Street as a managing director of <ORGANIZATION>Wertheim Schroder & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Coelho</PERSON> reports that many of his former colleagues have contacted him to find out how they, too, can pursue investment banking careers. 
<PERSON>Anne Burford</PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION> chief who resigned under fire in 1983 during a flap with <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, was kayoed in the confrontation, even though she was never charged with official wrondgoing.
Another former <ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON>Rita Lavelle</PERSON>, is still struggling after her conviction in 1983 on perjury charges. "There's nothing she could do to bring herself back to where she was," says her lawyer, <PERSON>James Bierbower</PERSON>. "You could say she survived, but it wasn't easy on her." 
No book contracts have been dangled before <PERSON>Deborah Gore Dean</PERSON>, the reigning queen of the <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> scandal.
<PERSON>Donna Rice</PERSON> of <PERSON>Gary Hart</PERSON> fame failed to obtain a book contract and lost her modeling contract for "No Excuses" jeans.
<PERSON>Fawn Hall</PERSON>, <PERSON>Oliver North</PERSON>'s former secretary, has yet to launch a hoped-for television news career, according to her lawyer. 
<PERSON>Rita Jenrette</PERSON>, the former wife of Abscam-indicted Rep. <PERSON>John Jenrette</PERSON>, has yet to hit it big in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>, although with roles in such movies as "Zombie Island Massacre" and "Aunt <PERSON>Ida</PERSON>'s Bikini Shop," she is doing a lot better than her former husband.
<PERSON>Richard Secord</PERSON>, the retired <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> general felled in the <LOCATION>Iran-Contra</LOCATION> scandal, is all but ruined -- forced to sell his <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> home and pull his kids out of college, according to a recent fund-raising appeal sent out on his behalf.
Even in the wake of Hurricane Hugo 750 people turned out in a remote <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> town in September for a "family tribute" to <PERSON>Mr. North</PERSON> given by two dozen conservative members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. 
Sex scandals make people look careless and silly, and one of the worst sins in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> is to be laughed at. "You can be wicked, but not foolish," says <PERSON>Mr. Mankiewicz</PERSON>. 
Nevertheless, Rep. <PERSON>Gerry Studds</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> was handily re-elected because of the candor with which he handled revelations that he had sex with a male congressional page in 1983. 
Former Rep. <PERSON>Robert Bauman</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Maryland Republican</ORGANIZATION> who lost his seat in 1980 after he was caught soliciting sex from a 16-year-old boy, has never regained his professional footing as a lawyer.
<PERSON>John Tower</PERSON> was accused of womanizing and boozing during his unsuccessful bid to win confirmation as secretary of <ORGANIZATION>defense</ORGANIZATION> earlier this year.
<PERSON>John Mack</PERSON> promptly quit his job last spring as an aide to Speaker Wright amid public outrage over <PERSON>Mr. Mack</PERSON>'s violent attack on a young woman when he was 19 years old.
Still, <PERSON>Mr. Mack</PERSON> says he talks to "30 members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> a week." Misery Loves Company 
<PERSON>Raymond Donovan</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> construction executive who was forced to resign as labor secretary and indicted in 1985, only to be acquitted of fraud charges, often calls other scandal-tossed public figures to offer a sympathetic ear.
One of the first people to come to the <LOCATION>Deaver</LOCATION> home after his troubles erupted was former <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> aide <PERSON>John Ehrlichman</PERSON>, whom <PERSON>Mr. Deaver</PERSON> scarcely knew. "He reassured me that the hurricane would end," <PERSON>Mr. Deaver</PERSON> recalls. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bauman</PERSON> received an encouraging letter from the recognized master of scandal survival, <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON>.
Says <PERSON>Mr. Bauman</PERSON>: "If things get really tough, I can always auction it off at <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's</ORGANIZATION>." 
But they are already objecting to, among other things, a plan to give more weight to cost-benefit considerations in evaluating pesticides."It's a tremendous disappointment," said <PERSON>Janet Hathaway</PERSON>, an attorney with the <ORGANIZATION>Natural Resources Defense Council</ORGANIZATION>. "Allowing the <ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION> to condone continued use of a chemical whenever the benefits outweigh the risks is absolutely anathema to the environmental community." 
FOREIGN PRIME RATES: <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> 13.50%; <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> 9%; <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> 4.875%; <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> 8.50%; <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> 15%.
<ORGANIZATION>FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORP.</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Freddie Mac</ORGANIZATION>): Posted yields on 30-year mortgage commitments for delivery within 30 days. 9.75%, standard conventional fixed-rate mortgages; 7.875%, 2% rate capped one-year adjustable rate mortgages.
<ORGANIZATION>FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Fannie Mae</ORGANIZATION>): Posted yields on 30 year mortgage commitments for delivery within 30 days (priced at par) 9.68%, standard conventional fixed-rate mortgages; 8.70%, 6/2 rate capped one-year adjustable rate mortgages.
In a statement, <PERSON>Scott McNealy</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sun</PERSON>'s chief executive officer, said the company's performance was hampered by problems tied to the introduction of a major new family of computers in April.
One of those new computers, called <ORGANIZATION>Sparcstation</ORGANIZATION> 1, accounted for nearly half of the 28,000 systems <ORGANIZATION>Sun</ORGANIZATION> shipped in the quarter, he said.
While this indicates continued strong demand for the company's desk-top computers, Sun faces increasing competition from <ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard Co</ORGANIZATION>. Recently, analysts have said <PERSON>Sun</PERSON> also is vulnerable to competition from <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which plans to introduce a group of workstations early next year, and <ORGANIZATION>Next Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
In the 1920s, a young schoolteacher, <PERSON>John T. Scopes</PERSON>, volunteered to be a guinea pig in a test case sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>American Civil Liberties Union</ORGANIZATION> to challenge a ban on the teaching of evolution imposed by the <ORGANIZATION>Tennessee Legislature</ORGANIZATION>.
The result was a world-famous trial exposing profound cultural conflicts in <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> life between the "smart set," whose spokesman was <PERSON>H.L. Mencken</PERSON>, and the religious fundamentalists, whom <PERSON>Mencken</PERSON> derided as benighted primitives.
So it was with the <PERSON>Hiss</PERSON> case a generation later, when <PERSON>Alger Hiss</PERSON> became a lightning rod for the anxieties of the Cold War and conflicting attitudes toward the <LOCATION>New Deal</LOCATION> he had served.
And so it seems to be with the case of <PERSON>Elizabeth Morgan</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, plastic surgeon jailed in a child custody case for refusing to reveal the whereabouts of her daughter.
<PERSON>Dr. Morgan</PERSON> has just emerged from the <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> jail after more than two years' confinement for contempt of court, a heroine to her many supporters. 
The first is that it represents an intense battle in what <PERSON>James Thurber</PERSON> used to caricature as "the war between the sexes." But although Thurber did so gently and lightheartedly, many of <PERSON>Dr. Morgan</PERSON>'s supporters have taken Thurber's memorable title "The Male Animal" quite literally.
As members of the <ORGANIZATION>Black Caucus in Congress</ORGANIZATION> asked during the debate on the legislation that freed <PERSON>Dr. Morgan</PERSON>, does anyone seriously believe that if she were an uneducated, black, working-class woman, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> would have rushed to pass a private relief bill freeing her?
Finally, the case of <PERSON>Dr. Morgan</PERSON> gave <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> an opportunity to act with unaccustomed decisiveness and to engage in one of its favorite pastimes -- bashing the <LOCATION>District of Columbia</LOCATION> government.
Bashing the <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> government is risk-free for members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, who do not have to answer to their own constituents for it. 
Yet a bill tailored to the interests of a single individual passed <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> with almost unimaginable speed, before the judicial process had run its course, and, indeed, while the <ORGANIZATION>Morgan</ORGANIZATION> case was awaiting a ruling by the appellate court. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Morgan</ORGANIZATION> case thus tells us much more about the current state of sex, class, race and politics in our society than it does about the facts of <PERSON>Dr. Morgan</PERSON>'s particular situation.
<PERSON>Mr. Rezneck</PERSON> is a lawyer in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> 
<PERSON>Mr. Taylor</PERSON>, 45 years old, succeeds <PERSON>Robert D. Kilpatrick</PERSON>, 64, who is retiring, as reported earlier.
In a corner of the cavernous, new <ORGANIZATION>Nippon Convention Center</ORGANIZATION> sits <ORGANIZATION>Mazda Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's advanced-technology display.
Here you can find <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> displaying a "live fish transporter," a truck akin to an aquarium on wheels, and <ORGANIZATION>Nissan Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> with its "keyless" <PERSON>Boga</PERSON>, whose doors unlock upon recognizing the owner's fingerprints.
Even the biggest auto shows in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> are largely regional affairs, but the <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> show is international.
<LOCATION>Detroit-to-Tokyo</LOCATION> flights were booked solid this week as <ORGANIZATION>Motor City</ORGANIZATION> executives, including <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co</ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON>Donald E. Petersen</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Vice Chairman <PERSON>Gerald Greenwald</PERSON>, flocked to see the future.
Even the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> came, for the first time in 24 years, to show off its <ORGANIZATION>Lada Niva</ORGANIZATION> sedan and its futuristic dark-blue "Kompakt" model. 
<ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> says it will introduce its first system next month on the Infiniti Q45 luxury sedan, and <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION>'s Celica coupe will go on sale with the suspension device next spring.
The two-stroke engine displays by <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Fuji Heavy Industries</ORGANIZATION>, the maker of <ORGANIZATION>Subaru</ORGANIZATION> cars, drew plenty of interest from <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auto executives, who are rushing to develop two-stroke engines. 
<ORGANIZATION>Honda Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> shows a more conventional five-cylinder engine in the new <ORGANIZATION>Accord Inspire</ORGANIZATION> model, which made its debut just this month -- in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> only.
It is rumored to be bound for a new model in the luxury <ORGANIZATION>Acura</ORGANIZATION> line in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, but <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION> officials wouldn't comment. 
<ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION> has a tiny motorcycle called the <LOCATION>Monkey</LOCATION>, and a slightly larger cousin, the <LOCATION>Gorilla</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi</ORGANIZATION> has a futuristic delivery truck called the <LOCATION>Guppy</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> has the <LOCATION>Bongo</LOCATION> truck and, under its <ORGANIZATION>Autozam</ORGANIZATION> nameplate, a "microvan" called the Scrum.
But the court jester appears to be <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s smallest car maker, <ORGANIZATION>Daihatsu Motor Co</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Daihatsu</PERSON> also has the Fellow 90, the <PERSON>Leeza Spider</PERSON> and the <PERSON>Hijet Dumbo</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Regie Nationale</PERSON> des <PERSON>Usines Renault</PERSON>, the French auto maker, has a concept car called the Megane.
<ORGANIZATION>Hyundai Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> has its first-ever exhibit in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> is sponsoring its first independent display in 10 years, and it includes a boxy <ORGANIZATION>Buick</ORGANIZATION> station wagon with wood-grain side panels.
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> also have exhibits, although theirs are tucked in a separate room with the less-popular automotive parts section. 
"We've got to get out of the <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> mentality and be part of the world mentality," declares <PERSON>Charles M. Jordan</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for design, in explaining his pilgrimage to the <LOCATION>Tokyo Show</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> officials, for example, crowed about their first-ever <ORGANIZATION>Tokyo Grand Prix</ORGANIZATION> racing victory.
True, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> was declared the winner Sunday, but only after the <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION> driver who crossed the finish line first was disqualified because it hit another car and skid momentarily out of bounds. 
<PERSON>Mr. Jordan</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, still criticizes Japanese styling. "It's hard for the Japanese," he says, "to get a feeling in a car, to get a passion in a car, to get emotion in a car." 
<ORGANIZATION>V.H. Van Horn</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>National Convenience</ORGANIZATION> president and chief executive officer, said the move reflects the company's realization that the industry's poor performance stems from its failure to give customers what they want -- rather than from increasing competition from gasoline stations and 24-hour grocery stores. "Convenience store merchandise has not kept pace with current trends in consumer preferences," he said in a speech at the company's annual shareholders meeting. 
National Convenience's move is likely to be echoed by other chains, though analysts note that <ORGANIZATION>Southland Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, owner of 7-Eleven stores, and <ORGANIZATION>Circle K Corp.</ORGANIZATION> are too debt-heavy to roll out such an extensive effort.
Some of our best and most idiosyncratic film makers -- from <LOCATION>Truffaut</LOCATION> to <PERSON>Fellini</PERSON> to <PERSON>Woody Allen</PERSON> -- have taken a cue from <LOCATION>Chekhov</LOCATION>: When it comes to compelling drama, there's no place like home. 
Everyone is very nice and good-looking -- the adoptive parents (<PERSON>Glenn Close</PERSON> and <PERSON>James Woods</PERSON>) and the teen-age couple who decide to give up their baby for adoption (<PERSON>Mary Stuart Masterson</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Kevin Dillon</ORGANIZATION>). 
<PERSON>Linda</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> (Ms.
Close and <PERSON>Mr. Woods</PERSON>), who seem to be pushing 40, live in a large and tastefully decorated home in suburban <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>.
Having exhausted all modern aids to fertility, <PERSON>Linda</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> decide to adopt.
At the other end of the life cycle is "Dad," <PERSON>Gary David Goldberg</PERSON>'s adaptation of the <PERSON>William Wharton</PERSON> novel.
<PERSON>Alvin W. Trivelpiece</PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION>Oak Ridge National Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Oak Ridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, was elected a director of this optical-products concern.
<PERSON>Mr. Trivelpiece</PERSON>, 58 years old, succeeds <PERSON>William Bolger</PERSON>, who died in August. 
<PERSON>George L. Manzanec</PERSON>, 53 years old, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Eastern Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, was elected a group vice president of this natural-gas-pipeline concern.
<PERSON>Mr. Manzanec</PERSON>, who succeeds retiring <PERSON>Richard C. Dixon</PERSON>, will be responsible for gas supply, regulatory affairs, and marketing and transportation and exchange for <ORGANIZATION>Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Trunkline Gas Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Texas Eastern Transmission Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Algonquin Gas Transmission Co</ORGANIZATION>.
All of the companies are units of <ORGANIZATION>Panhandle Eastern Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which acquired <ORGANIZATION>Texas Eastern Corp.</ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. 
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Democrats who favor cutting the capital-gains tax aren't ready to line up behind the leading <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> proposal. 
Nevertheless, <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> <PERSON>Sen. Bob Packwood</PERSON>, the ranking <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> member on the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION>Senate Finance Committee</ORGANIZATION>, last night introduced his plan as an amendment to a pending measure authorizing <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> aid for <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON>George Mitchell</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>) was confident he had enough votes to block the maneuver on procedural grounds, perhaps as soon as today.
<PERSON>Mr. Packwood</PERSON> all but conceded defeat, telling <PERSON>Mr. Mitchell</PERSON>: "I sense at this stage you may have the votes." 
Their tone was good-natured, with <PERSON>Mr. Packwood</PERSON> saying he intended to offer the proposal again and again on future legislation and <PERSON>Sen. Mitchell</PERSON> saying he intended to use procedural means to block it again and again. 
Although the proposal, authored by <PERSON>Mr. Packwood</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sen. William Roth</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Del.</LOCATION>), appears to have general backing by Republicans, their votes aren't sufficient to pass it.
"A number of us are not going to touch capital gains, IRAs or anything else unless it contributes to deficit-reduction," said <PERSON>Sen. Charles Robb</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>), who is one of the 10 to 20 Democrats who the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration believes might favor giving preferential treatment to capital gains. 
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has been hearing this kind of opposition first hand during meetings over the past two days with <ORGANIZATION>Democratic</ORGANIZATION> senators at the White House.
The trend is making advocates of the tax cut less optimistic about success. "There is a one-out-of-three shot of getting it this year," said <PERSON>Sen. David Boren</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, a leading Democratic proponent of cutting the capital-gains tax.
Other Democrats who favor a capital-gains cut are even more pessimistic. "There will be no capital-gains bill this year," said <PERSON>Sen. Dale Bumpers</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>). "I'm probably not going to vote for any capital-gains proposal.
Another significant factor in the capitalgains debate is the extent to which it has become a purely political battle between President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON>Mitchell</PERSON>.
Estimates requested by <PERSON>Sen. Mitchell</PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION>Congressional Joint Taxation Committee</ORGANIZATION> show that the richest 100 taxpayers got an average benefit from the capital-gains differential of $13 million each in 1985, the last year for which figures are available. 
Democrats asked in this week for discussions with President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> have suggested ways of "tinkering" with the <ORGANIZATION>Packwood-Roth</ORGANIZATION> proposal, suggesting an interest in looking for a modified version they can back, one official said. 
But the officials insist that such a deal on a future vote would have to apply to both the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> plans to send the <LOCATION>Chinese</LOCATION> back home and is negotiating with the <LOCATION>Chinese</LOCATION> government, a <ORGANIZATION>Justice Ministry</ORGANIZATION> official said.
The Chinese were among 3,372 boat people supposedly from <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> who arrived in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> this year, compared with 219 for all of 1988, the official said. 
<PERSON>Francoise Verne</PERSON>, 52-year-old former deputy director of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s mint, faces prison for her theft of some 67 rare coins from the mint's collections.
Second in command from 1979 to 1984, <PERSON>Mrs. Verne</PERSON> told a <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> court that the "great disorder" that reigned at the agency led her into temptation.
<PERSON>Tony Lambert</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mrs. Verne</PERSON>'s successor, says the mint's losses from the theft run into the hundreds of thousands of francs. 
The state <ORGANIZATION>Supply Regulator Institute</ORGANIZATION> is to burn rice, corn and beans that spoiled because of neglect and corruption in the previous Christian Democrat government, a statement from the information service <ORGANIZATION>SISAL</ORGANIZATION> said.
Another 250 Libyans were already in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> to stage a day of mourning for victims of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s colonial rule between 1911 and 1943, when <PERSON>Tripoli</PERSON> says <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> kidnapped 5,000 Libyans and deported them as forced labor.
<LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>'s revolutionary <ORGANIZATION>Committees</ORGANIZATION> have threatened attacks on Italians if <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> doesn't pay compensation.
But officials in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> say the issue was legally resolved by a settlement between <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and <PERSON>King Idris</PERSON>, deposed by Col. <PERSON>Muammar Gadhafi</PERSON> in 1969. 
Representatives of the Inuit and <ORGANIZATION>Cree</ORGANIZATION> peoples living in <LOCATION>Quebec</LOCATION> and Labrador in northeastern <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> told the ministry of the planned action at a meeting, a ministry spokesman said.
The action, in the <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Federal Court</ORGANIZATION>, will be against <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, the ministry spokesman said. 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> suspended imports of <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> mushrooms after finding some contaminated by radiation, an official of the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Health and Welfare</ORGANIZATION> said.
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> has been testing imported food from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> since the April 1986 Chernobyl accident in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, the spokesman said.
Since then, the ministry has announced 50 bans on food imports from <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> countries, including <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>. 
Located six miles northeast of <LOCATION>Venice</LOCATION>, the field contains 875 billion cubic feet of methane gas-one-tenth of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s reserves. 
The council unanimously opposed the idea of <ORGANIZATION>AGIP</ORGANIZATION> pumping out the methane gas and swiftly appealed to the company and to Prime Minister <PERSON>Giulio Andreotti</PERSON>, who has yet to reply. 
Thieves stole a 12th century fresco from an abandoned church in <LOCATION>Camerino</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, by removing the entire wall on which the work had been painted, police said. . . . <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> commissioned the <ORGANIZATION>Nuremberg</ORGANIZATION> post office to test a prototype battery-powered car.
<ORGANIZATION>Rochester Telephone Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION>Viroqua Telephone Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Viroqua</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wis</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Rochester</ORGANIZATION> will exchange shares of its common stock for all shares outstanding of <ORGANIZATION>Viroqua Telephone</ORGANIZATION>, a family-owned company. 
<ORGANIZATION>Viroqua</ORGANIZATION> serves about 3,000 access lines in western <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>. 
Labor Secretary <PERSON>Elizabeth Dole</PERSON> named a mediator to help resolve the lengthy labor dispute between the <ORGANIZATION>United Mine Workers and Pittston Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>W.J. Usery Jr.</PERSON>, labor secretary during the <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> administration, was named to mediate talks to settle the six-month strike by the <ORGANIZATION>UMW</ORGANIZATION>. 
Previous talks between <LOCATION>Pittston</LOCATION>, of <LOCATION>Greenwich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, and the union have been sporadic and unsuccessful. 
The union called the strike in April after <LOCATION>Pittston</LOCATION> refused to sign the <ORGANIZATION>UMW</ORGANIZATION>'s national labor pact.
Foreclosures and other signs of financial distress, most often associated with the real estate market in the <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION>, are surfacing in the suburban office market of the once thriving <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION>. 
Some projects are now in the hands of lenders, including a 425,000-square-foot office facility in <LOCATION>Little Falls</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>
The owners of a 32-acre hotel and office complex in King of <LOCATION>Prussia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, have advertised for new financing.
Rising office vacancy rates in <LOCATION>Fairfield County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, have builders and bankers scrambling to restructure loans.
Many troubled properties haven't been foreclosed on and are hard to identify, says <PERSON>Albert I. Berger</PERSON>, who heads the <LOCATION>Secaucus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, office of <ORGANIZATION>Helmsley-Spear Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a real estate brokerage.
Real estate analyst <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd Lynford</ORGANIZATION> says the <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION>'s distress is masked by relatively low vacancy rates.
WHY SHOULD the Japanese cross the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> to buy <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> real estate when they can simply recreate it at home? 
<ORGANIZATION>Tokyu Development Corp.</ORGANIZATION> is spending $500 million to build American-style luxury homes in suburban <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> with rarely seen back yards, front yards, swimming pools and tennis courts. 
The Japanese company hired <PERSON>Richardson Nagy Martin</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Newport Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, architectural firm, to design what the Japanese press has dubbed "the <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>." Instead of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s typical small homes clustered on narrow streets with no sidewalks, the new "One Hundred Hills" development will offer 65 houses on half-acre lots.
Buyers with $6 million to spend can select from 11 designs, including a Mediterranean-inspired <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> style, a traditional <ORGANIZATION>Yankee</ORGANIZATION> look and designs inspired by Midwestern architect <PERSON>Frank Lloyd Wright</PERSON>.
"One of the difficulties people in real estate have is that each product is like starting a new company, or starting a new line in the fashion business," says <PERSON>L. Robert Lieb</PERSON> president of <ORGANIZATION>Mountain Development Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>West Paterson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>
<ORGANIZATION>Weingarten-Siegel Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Manalapan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, has built <ORGANIZATION>Cross Creek Pointe</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Allegro Pointe</PERSON> and other Pointes in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Caspi Development Corp of Armonk</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, has developed two apartment buildings called Classic and plans a third.
<PERSON>Beacon Hill</PERSON> is for "move-up" town houses, and <PERSON>Nob Hill</PERSON>, for single-family houses.
Because of standardized designs, <PERSON>Mr. Hovnanian</PERSON> says, "a buyer can visualize <ORGANIZATION>Society Hill</ORGANIZATION> regardless of where it is." 
"I think there's a disease called buyer's regret, and I'm sure it's running rampant at this moment, but it gets cured in a short period of time," says <PERSON>Kenneth Leventhal</PERSON>, co-managing partner of <ORGANIZATION>Kenneth Leventhal & Co</ORGANIZATION>,. a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> accounting firm specializing in real estate. "If I were buying a building in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> now the first thing I'd do is insist on a structural inspection, then I'd delay a little, stall a little." 
But like other real estate professionals accustomed to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s quake risks, <PERSON>Mr. Leventhal</PERSON> anticipates little long-term change in the city's commercial real estate market. 
Planners of the <ORGANIZATION>Urban Land Institute</ORGANIZATION> real estate conference this week hastily added a panel on the quake's effects. "The message is we build'em right," says <PERSON>Peter Bedford</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> developer and officer at <ORGANIZATION>Urban Land Institute</ORGANIZATION>. "There's seven million square feet of space that's doing great." 
That Labor Day, in his first major act after succeeding the resigned <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON> as president, <PERSON>Gerald R. Ford</PERSON> signed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.
In 1972, then <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>George Shultz</PERSON>, with the key support of <PERSON>Sen. Carl Curtis</PERSON>, sought some form of pensions for the uncovered.
That year a four-man group headed by <PERSON>William Lieber</PERSON> in the Legislation and Regulations division of the Office of the Chief Counsel for the <ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION>, was assigned the task of designing a plan. 
They used the 1962 <ORGANIZATION>Keogh Plan</ORGANIZATION>, a pension plan created by a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> congressman for the self-employed, as a partial model.
So they opted for <ORGANIZATION>IRA</ORGANIZATION>, naming it after <PERSON>Ira Cohen</PERSON>, a brilliant <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> actuary who helped them.
But in 1986 <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> sharply reduced the number of people who could qualify for its benefits and <ORGANIZATION>IRA</ORGANIZATION> tax-deductions slowed their roaring growth. 
But the computer giant appears to have lost a second key contract with <PERSON>Kodak</PERSON> to archrival <ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Kodak</PERSON> yesterday confirmed that it has entered negotiations with <PERSON>Maynard</PERSON>, Mass.-based <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION> to manage all of its voice and data communications needs.
<LOCATION>Kodak</LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION>Rochester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> also had bid for the business.
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> is based in <LOCATION>Armonk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION> 
The loss is a setback to <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>, which pointed to the <LOCATION>Kodak</LOCATION> contract as an example of its success in systems integration.
He said that <ORGANIZATION>American Telephone & Telegraph</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>MCI Communications Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Rochester Telephone Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> itself would likely be <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION>'s subcontractors on the project. 
"When we decided to look outside the company for critical data-processing and communications services, we wanted to get the best vendor for that service," said <PERSON>Paul Allen</PERSON>, the spokesman. "That's why we went with <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> for data center management . . . and now <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION> for voice and data telecommunications." 
<ORGANIZATION>Bell Atlantic Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it agreed definitively to acquire one of <ORGANIZATION>Control Data Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's computer-maintenance businesses.
<ORGANIZATION>Control Data</ORGANIZATION>'s third-party maintenance unit services products primarily made by <ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
Under the agreement, which had been widely expected, <ORGANIZATION>Bell Atlantic</ORGANIZATION> would be buying <ORGANIZATION>Control Data</ORGANIZATION>'s customer base and its approximately 100 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> maintenance facilities in about 33 cities.
<PERSON>Lawrence Perlman</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Control Data</ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief operating officer, said the maintenance business no longer fits into the company's "strategy to be a data solutions company." 
<PERSON>Thomas Vassiliades</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Bell Atlantic</ORGANIZATION>'s customer services division, said the acquisition would give the company's <ORGANIZATION>Sorbus</ORGANIZATION> computer-maintenance unit added expertise in "the increasingly sophisticated workstation and high-end mainframe technologies." 
<PERSON>Russell Miller</PERSON>'s "Bare-Faced Messiah: The True Story of <PERSON>L. Ron Hubbard</PERSON>" is a biography of the founder of the <ORGANIZATION>Church of Scientology</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Hubbard</PERSON>, who died in 1986, bequeathed the copyrights on his writings to his church, which licensed them to <ORGANIZATION>New Era Publications</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Danish</LOCATION> corporation.
In 1988 <ORGANIZATION>New Era</ORGANIZATION> sought a permanent injunction to restrain <ORGANIZATION>Henry Holt & Co.</ORGANIZATION> from publishing "Bare-Faced Messiah" on the ground that <PERSON>Mr. Miller</PERSON>'s quotations from <PERSON>Mr. Hubbard</PERSON> infringed the copyrights.
District Court <PERSON>Judge Pierre Leval</PERSON> denied the injunction on the ground that <ORGANIZATION>New Era</ORGANIZATION> had failed to make its claim within a reasonable time -- the doctrine lawyers call "laches." As for the merits, <PERSON>Judge Leval</PERSON> said that <PERSON>Mr. Miller</PERSON> had written "a serious book of responsible historical criticism." Verbatim quotation, the judge believed, was justified in order to prove points the author had asserted about <PERSON>Mr. Hubbard</PERSON> -- mendacity, bigotry, paranoia and other unlovely traits that could not be persuasively demonstrated without use of <PERSON>Mr. Hubbard</PERSON>'s own words. "The biographer/critic," <PERSON>Judge Leval</PERSON> wrote, "should not be required simply to express . . . conclusions without defending them by example." In such circumstances, free-speech interests outweighed the interests of the copyright owner. 
But <PERSON>Judge Leval</PERSON> felt constrained by an earlier decision of the <ORGANIZATION>Second Circuit Court</ORGANIZATION> forbidding a biographer of <PERSON>J.D. Salinger</PERSON> to quote from <PERSON>Mr. Salinger</PERSON>'s personal letters.
He distinguished the two cases: In <LOCATION>Salinger</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Judge Leval</PERSON> noted, the quotations were for the purpose of enlivening the biography rather than of proving points about the subject.
<PERSON>Judge Leval</PERSON> reluctantly concluded that a few of <PERSON>Mr. Miller</PERSON>'s quotations from <PERSON>Mr. Hubbard</PERSON>'s unpublished writings, because they were not necessary to prove historical points, failed the fair-use test and therefore infringed copyright.
In a decision in April of this year, <PERSON>Judge Roger Miner</PERSON>, joined by <PERSON>Judge Frank Altimari</PERSON>, agreed on denying the injunction and did not doubt that "Bare-Faced Messiah" was a serious work but rejected <PERSON>Judge Leval</PERSON>'s argument that the public interest in scholarship could outweigh the sanctity of copyright. "We conclude," the two judges wrote, "that laches is the sole bar to the issuance of an injunction." Had the suit been filed in time, they said, "Bare-Faced Messiah" would have been suppressed. 
In a powerful separate opinion, <PERSON>Judge Oakes</PERSON> further distinguished the <PERSON>Salinger</PERSON> case by pointing out that a living person, like <PERSON>Mr. Salinger</PERSON>, had privacy rights that did not apply to a dead man, like <PERSON>Mr. Hubbard</PERSON>. "I thought that Salinger might by being taken in another factual context come back to haunt us.
Decisions by the <ORGANIZATION>Second Circuit</ORGANIZATION> itself, <PERSON>Judge Oakes</PERSON> continued, had recognized that public interest in the subject matter and the indispensability in particular cases of verbatim quotations are vital components of fair use.
And the injunction <ORGANIZATION>Judges Miner</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Altimari</PERSON> would so readily have granted had New Era sued in time?
A second decision, handed down in August by the <ORGANIZATION>Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>Ninth Circuit</ORGANIZATION>, is another blow against scholarship.
<PERSON>Janet Malcolm</PERSON>, a professional writer on psychiatric matters, wrote a series of articles for the <ORGANIZATION>New Yorker</ORGANIZATION>, later published in book form by <PERSON>Knopf</PERSON> under the title "In the <ORGANIZATION>Freud Archives</ORGANIZATION>." The articles were largely based on interviews <PERSON>Ms. Malcolm</PERSON> had taped with <PERSON>Jeffrey Masson</PERSON>, a psychoanalyst who had served as projects director of the <ORGANIZATION>Freud Archives</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Masson</PERSON> then brought a libel suit against <PERSON>Ms. Malcolm</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>New Yorker</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Knopf</ORGANIZATION>.
As a public figure, <PERSON>Mr. Masson</PERSON> had to prove malice and, as proof of malice, <PERSON>Mr. Masson</PERSON> contended that defamatory quotations ascribed to him by <PERSON>Ms. Malcolm</PERSON> were in fact fabricated.
But <PERSON>Judge Arthur Alarcon</PERSON>, joined by <PERSON>Judge Cynthia Holcomb Hall</PERSON>, took the astonishing position that it is perfectly OK to fabricate quotations so long as a judge finds that the fabrications do not alter substantive content or are rational interpretations of ambiguous remarks. 
<PERSON>Ms. Malcolm</PERSON>, for example, wrote that <PERSON>Mr. Masson</PERSON> described himself as "the greatest analyst who ever lived." No such statement appears on the tapes.
The majority cited <PERSON>Mr. Masson</PERSON>'s remark "It's me alone . . . against the rest of the analytic world" as warrant for the <LOCATION>Malcolm</LOCATION> fabrication.
But, as <PERSON>Judge Kozinski</PERSON> noted, the context shows that <PERSON>Mr. Masson</PERSON>'s "me alone" remark referred not to his alleged pre-eminence in his profession but to the fact that his position on a particular issue was not shared by anyone else. 
<PERSON>Ms. Malcolm</PERSON> had <PERSON>Mr. Masson</PERSON> describing himself as "an intellectual gigolo." Again, no such statement appears on the tapes.
The majority decision contended that the phrase was a rational interpretation of <PERSON>Mr. Masson</PERSON>'s description of himself as a "private asset but a public liability" to <PERSON>Anna Freud</PERSON> and that in any case it was not defamatory.
These were only two of a series of fabrications that had, in <PERSON>Judge Kozinski</PERSON>'s words, the cumulative effect of making <PERSON>Mr. Masson</PERSON> "appear more arrogant, less sensitive, shallower, more self-aggrandizing, and less in touch with reality than he appears from his own statements." As <PERSON>Robert Coles</PERSON> wrote in a review of <PERSON>Ms. Malcolm</PERSON>'s book, <PERSON>Mr. Masson</PERSON> emerges "as a grandiose egotist . . . and, in the end, a self-destructive fool.
"There is one sacred rule of journalism," <PERSON>John Hersey</PERSON> has said. "The writer must not invent." Should the green light <PERSON>Judges Alarcon</PERSON> and Hall have given to the fabrication of quotations become standard practice, it will notably reduce the value of journalism for historians -- and for citizens.
As <PERSON>Judge Kozinski</PERSON> put it: "To invoke the right to deliberately distort what someone else has said is to assert the right to lie in print. . . . <PERSON>Masson</PERSON> has lost his case, but the defendants, and the profession to which they belong, have lost far more." 
<PERSON>Mr. Schlesinger</PERSON> is <PERSON>Albert Schweitzer</PERSON> professor of the humanities at the <ORGANIZATION>City University of New York</ORGANIZATION> and a winner of Pulitzer Prizes in history and biography. 
Earlier this year, public television station <ORGANIZATION>WGBH</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> fired <PERSON>Mr. Vila</PERSON> after a sponsor protested some of his numerous commercial endorsements. 
With <PERSON>Mr. Vila</PERSON> as host, "This Old House" became one of the <ORGANIZATION>Public Broadcasting Service</ORGANIZATION>'s top 10 programs, airing weekly on about 300 of the network's stations and seen by an average of 12 million viewers. 
But <ORGANIZATION>Home Depot Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, an Atlanta-based home center chain, objected when <PERSON>Mr. Vila</PERSON> started doing commercial endorsements for <ORGANIZATION>Rickel Home Centers</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> building supply company that competes with <ORGANIZATION>Home Depot</ORGANIZATION> in some markets. 
"I'm ecstatic about the change," said <PERSON>Mr. Vila</PERSON>, whose new syndicated program is called "Home Again with <PERSON>Bob Vila</PERSON>." In an interview, <PERSON>Mr. Vila</PERSON> criticized his old show, which is continuing with a new host. 
While <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION> wouldn't comment on the brouhaha over <PERSON>Mr. Vila</PERSON>'s commercial endorsements, it appears to be building a fence around <PERSON>Mr. Vila</PERSON>'s affections.
<ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy & Mather</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>WPP Group PLC</ORGANIZATION>, will handle the advertising account and syndication. 
Little matter for <PERSON>Mr. Vila</PERSON>, who complains that "public TV never paid me more than $40,000 a year." He said his compensation under the <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION> contract is "a multimillion dollar deal." 
<ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's big defense and automotive electronics unit, <ORGANIZATION>GM Hughes Electronics</ORGANIZATION>, said net income fell 22% in the third quarter, reflecting declining military spending and slumping <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> vehicle production. 
Meanwhile, net at <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s finance arm, <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Acceptance Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, fell 3.1%.
By contrast, <ORGANIZATION>Electronic Data Systems Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s data processing subsidiary, boosted net 16%. 
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> closed down $1.875 at $44.875 in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> trading yesterday.
Earnings for <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> common stock, reflecting the performance of <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s core automotive operations, will be disclosed this morning.
<ORGANIZATION>GM Class H</ORGANIZATION>, which represents a dividend interest in Hughes earnings, closed at $29, up 25 cents in <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> composite trading.
<ORGANIZATION>GM Class E</ORGANIZATION>, which represents a dividend interest in <ORGANIZATION>EDS</ORGANIZATION> profit, fell 75 cents to $52.25 on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>. 
The earnings drop at <ORGANIZATION>GM Hughes Electronics</ORGANIZATION> is a sign of tough times at both the defense operations of <ORGANIZATION>Hughes Aircraft Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>North American</LOCATION> automotive operations, which are a primary customer for the <ORGANIZATION>Delco Electronics Corp.</ORGANIZATION> side of the <ORGANIZATION>GM Hughes</ORGANIZATION> unit. 
In addition, <ORGANIZATION>GM's North American</ORGANIZATION> vehicle production fell 8.4% from a year ago, which hurt <ORGANIZATION>Delco Electronic</ORGANIZATION>'s earnings, a company spokesman said.
<ORGANIZATION>GMAC</ORGANIZATION> said its automotive financing and leasing business rose 35% in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, largely because of dealer and customer incentives used to boost sales.
<ORGANIZATION>GMAC</ORGANIZATION> profits are combined with earnings from the rest of <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s operations and attributed to the company's traditional common stock. 
A genetically engineered version of the human protein developed by <ORGANIZATION>Amgen Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Thousand Oaks</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, recently has been marketed by the <ORGANIZATION>Ortho Pharmaceuticals division of Johnson & Johnson</ORGANIZATION>.
A competing version of <ORGANIZATION>EPO</ORGANIZATION> is being developed by <ORGANIZATION>Genetics Institute Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>.
A new experiment, reported in this week's New England Journal of Medicine, involved giving injections of <ORGANIZATION>Amgen</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>EPO</ORGANIZATION> to 23 patients who wanted to store units of their own blood. 
This British banking and financial-services group's investment-banking arm, <ORGANIZATION>Barclays de Zoete Wedd Group</ORGANIZATION>, announced the following appointments at its merchant-banking subsidiary <ORGANIZATION>Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>John Padovan</PERSON>, 51 years old, was named a deputy chairman.
<PERSON>Mr. Padovan</PERSON> is currently a director at <ORGANIZATION>Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Graham Pimlott</PERSON>, 40, was named to the new post of chief executive officer of the merchant-banking corporate-finance division.
<PERSON>Mr. Pimlott</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. McCarthy</PERSON> join <ORGANIZATION>Barclay</ORGANIZATION>'s from <ORGANIZATION>Kleinwort Benson Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> where they served as directors. 
As the stock market lurched into a 190-point free fall on Oct. 13, <PERSON>Mr. Breeden</PERSON> found himself scurrying around the sixth floor of the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> -- from his desk, where the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> was on an open line, to his assistant's office, where the <ORGANIZATION>Commodity Futures Trading Commission</ORGANIZATION> was connected, to a third room, where a computer monitored market moves.
But unlike <PERSON>Mr. Ruder</PERSON>, who during the 1987 crash damaged himself by saying rather offhandedly that the markets might be closed, <PERSON>Mr. Breeden</PERSON> is turning the market drop to his own advantage, using it to further his agenda for the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>. 
In an interview and in congressional testimony, he repeatedly points to the recent 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- the second-largest ever -- as evidence of the need for <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to give the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> the ability to better monitor leveraged buy-out loan activity by brokerage firms and to track big trades in the market.
A veteran of another financial crisis, the savings-and-loan bailout, <PERSON>Mr. Breeden</PERSON> wants to have the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> regulate securities issued by banks and S&Ls. 
He believes the tax code encourages the use of debt instead of stock and may fuel leveraged buy-outs, an area the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> doesn't regulate directly but one where it wields influence both on <LOCATION>Wall Street</LOCATION> and in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. 
Also unlike <PERSON>Mr. Ruder</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Breeden</PERSON> appears to be in a position to get somewhere with his agenda.
As a former <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> aide who worked closely with <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, he is savvy in the ways of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Breeden</PERSON>'s selection will be scrutinized as an important signal about the strength of his commitment to continuing the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>'s high-profile pursuit of insider trading and market manipulation on Wall Street. 
Members of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Banking Committee</ORGANIZATION> know <PERSON>Mr. Breeden</PERSON> from working on the thrift-bailout bill, and the relationship generally remains warm.
These days, <PERSON>Mr. Breeden</PERSON> is winning praise in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and on <LOCATION>Wall Street</LOCATION> for his behind-the-scenes role in monitoring the Friday-the-13th market plunge and the following Monday's harrowing morning session.
Some in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> contend that it's too soon to tell whether <PERSON>Mr. Breeden</PERSON> will help or hinder the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>. "I don't think this was a real test," says one congressional aide. "It was a fairly stressful weekend, but my sense is if you hadn't had <PERSON>Richard Breeden</PERSON> there, it wouldn't have made much of a difference." 
For some at the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>, an agency that covets its independence, <PERSON>Mr. Breeden</PERSON> may be too much of a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> insider.
They note that he has adorned his office with five photos of <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>, one of them featuring the First Dog, <PERSON>Millie</PERSON>.
They worry that <PERSON>Mr. Breeden</PERSON> also will roll over when told to do so by the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>.
But <PERSON>Mr. Breeden</PERSON> already has shown an eagerness to run the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> his way.
During the Monday market rebound, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> exchange spokesman told <ORGANIZATION>Cable News Network</ORGANIZATION> viewers that the industrial average had turned down 70 points.
<ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> staffers soon determined that a widely watched stock-market service, <LOCATION>Quotron</LOCATION>, had miscalculated the industrial average.
<PERSON>Mr. Breeden</PERSON> instructed <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> staffers to inform the network that it was airing the wrong number. "It was the plunge that didn't happen," he says. 
<PERSON>Mr. Breeden</PERSON> also is trying to use a far more catastrophic event -- the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> earthquake -- to move another rule change past <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
In the bidding war for <ORGANIZATION>Public Service Co. of New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>United Illuminating Co.</ORGANIZATION> raised its proposed offer to one it valued at $2.29 billion from $2.19 billion, apparently topping all other bidders. 
The unsecured creditors agreed in principle to support <LOCATION>New Haven</LOCATION>, Conn.-based <ORGANIZATION>United Illuminating</ORGANIZATION>'s new bid.
<PERSON>Geoffrey Kalmus</PERSON>, counsel to the official creditors committee, said that under the <ORGANIZATION>United Illuminating</ORGANIZATION> plan, unsecured creditors would be paid in full credits and interest of about $855 million, accrued before <ORGANIZATION>PS of New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION>'s Jan. 1988 filing for bankruptcy court protection.
It would be 72%-owned by <ORGANIZATION>United Illuminating</ORGANIZATION> holders and 28%-owned by current holders of <ORGANIZATION>PS of New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION> preferred and common stock.
As previously reported, <ORGANIZATION>Northeast Utilities</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Hartford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, Monday filed a bid it valued at $2.25 billion.
The other bidders, <ORGANIZATION>New England Electric System</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Westboro</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>PS of New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION>, didn't change the value of their bids, although <ORGANIZATION>PS of New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION> changed its rate proposal.
<ORGANIZATION>New England Electric</ORGANIZATION> values its offer at $2 billion and <ORGANIZATION>PS of New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION> values its reorganization plan at $2.2 billion. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> trading, <ORGANIZATION>PS of New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION>'s 17 1/2 debenture due 2004 closed yesterday at $82.50, up $2.
<LOCATION>WASHINGTON</LOCATION> -- <ORGANIZATION>United Technologies Corp.</ORGANIZATION> won an $18 million <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> contract for helicopter modifications and spare parts. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ingalls Shipbuilding Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION>Litton Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, was given a $15.5 million extension on a contract for shipyard services. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ohbayashi Corp.</ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION>E.W. Howell Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> subsidiary of Selmer-Sande AS, of <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>, for about $7 million. 
<PERSON>Howell</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Port Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, construction concern, was established in 1891.
<ORGANIZATION>MGM Grand Inc.</ORGANIZATION> has agreed to pay $93 million and nearly 1.8 million common shares to buy 117 acres of land along the <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>, Strip as a site for its planned movie-studio and theme-park resort. 
Of the total purchase price, $50 million cash and $30 million in stock (nearly 1.8 million shares) would be paid to buy the existing 700-room <ORGANIZATION>Marina Hotel</ORGANIZATION> & Casino from <ORGANIZATION>Southwest Securities</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> limited partnership.
The remaining properties to be acquired are the <ORGANIZATION>Tropicana Country Club & Golf Course</ORGANIZATION>, a facility jointly owned by <ORGANIZATION>Ramada Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, and the <PERSON>Jaffe</PERSON> family, and a small parcel owned by <ORGANIZATION>MGM Grand</ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON>James D. Aljian</PERSON>. 
The luxury airline and casino company, 98.6%-owned by investor <PERSON>Kirk Kerkorian</PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION>Tracinda Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, earlier this month announced its agreements to acquire the properties, but didn't disclose the purchase price. 
The proposed stock offering and issuance of nearly 1.8 million common shares in connection with the land purchase will bring MGM Grand's total shares outstanding to 28.7 million, of which 72% will be owned by <PERSON>Mr. Kerkorian</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Tracinda</ORGANIZATION>, according to the prospectus. 
Proceeds from the offering are expected to be used for remodeling the company's <ORGANIZATION>Desert Inn</ORGANIZATION> resort in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, refurbishing certain aircraft of the <ORGANIZATION>MGM Grand Air</ORGANIZATION> unit, and to acquire the property for the new resort.
The company said it estimates the <ORGANIZATION>Desert Inn</ORGANIZATION> remodeling will cost about $32 million, and the refurbishment of the three DC-8-62 aircraft, made by <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, will cost around $24.5 million. 
This has been a week of stunning events behind what was once called the <LOCATION>Iron Curtain</LOCATION> and interesting shifts in official <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>.
It has also been a week when inside-the-beltway <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> has had a high old time gnawing over ex-President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s multimillion-dollar junket in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
Our ability to influence the outcome of events in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> is far more marginal. 
Earlier this week, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON>Eduard A. Shevardnadze</PERSON> confessed that the <LOCATION>U.S.S.R.</LOCATION> ignored universal human values by invading <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> and, to put it bluntly, "engaged in a violation of the <ORGANIZATION>ABM</ORGANIZATION> Treaty" by building its radar station at <LOCATION>Krasnoyarsk</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> is no longer a "Socialist Peoples" republic, the <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> no longer has automatic delegates in the <LOCATION>U.S.S.R.</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Congress of Peoples Deputies</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Egon Krenz</PERSON> was not backed unanimously by his fellow party functionaries when he took over as <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>'s new maximum leader.
Of like, though lesser, note, Secretary of State <PERSON>James Baker</PERSON> put the administration four-square behind perestroika and glasnost, and therefore behind <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON>, in a pair of carefully reasoned speeches over the past week or so.
And, last but not least, President <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> now views the changes in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION> as "absolutely extraordinary" and believes that <PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON> "can't turn the clock back" in <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> because the change is too inexorable," as he told the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>R.W. Apple Jr.</ORGANIZATION> (In other words, after some highly visible dithering and public airing of differences, the administration has come down on the side of those who believe that what we are witnessing from <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Siberia</LOCATION> is a good thing to be welcomed, rather than a new thing to be feared or viewed with suspicion.) 
For journalists, however, who write what they fondly view as history's first draft, this has also been a week to give a lot of space and time to <PERSON>Ron</PERSON> and <PERSON>Nancy</PERSON>'s sales appearance in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> on behalf of a communications giant and its controversial founder.
All of which has enabled those of us in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> who enjoy wallowing in such things to go into high public dudgeon, as <PERSON>Mr. Apple</PERSON> and I did the other night on <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s "Nightline." Punching away, we raised what I still think were all the right issues and landed more than one hard blow, but at the end of the affair, there was just the tiniest nagging worry that we had been aiming at the wrong target.
As a last recourse, when all else has failed and you are pinned, apologize for having disappointed those who trusted you but deny having actually done anything wrong. (See, for instance, <PERSON>Jim Bakker</PERSON>'s remarks upon being sentenced to prison this Tuesday for defrauding the faithful.) Consider the troubling dissonance between <PERSON>Mr. Shevardnadze</PERSON>'s speech of confession this week and the hang-tough defense of everyone concerned with the <LOCATION>Iran-Contra</LOCATION> affair.
"I'm not going to be stampeded into overreacting to any of this, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> told <PERSON>Mr. Apple</PERSON> in this week's interview.
In a rare package sale of its real estate, <ORGANIZATION>K mart Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Troy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, has sold 17 of its strip shopping centers to a limited partnership led by <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> developer <PERSON>Philip Pilevsky</PERSON>, according to sources familiar with the transaction.
They are spread around the country and include locations in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Pilevsky</PERSON>, who heads <ORGANIZATION>Philips International Holding Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New</LOCATION> York-based real estate company, owns more than a dozen other shopping centers in which K mart is a tenant.
In contrast to the 1% conversion fee charged by <ORGANIZATION>Visa</ORGANIZATION>, foreign-currency dealers routinely charge 7% or more to convert <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollars into foreign currency.
C. <PERSON>Hyde Tucker</PERSON> will become president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Bell Atlantic International Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of this telecommunications concern, effective Jan. 1.
<PERSON>Mr. Tucker</PERSON>, 56 years old, is currently vice president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION>Bell Atlantic</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>C&P Telephone</ORGANIZATION> unit.
<PERSON>Mr. Tucker</PERSON> will succeed <PERSON>Salvatore J. Barbera</PERSON>, 64, who will hold the newly created position of chairman of the international unit until his retirement April 1. 
<ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Daimler-Benz AG</ORGANIZATION>, paid <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> $9.1 million in taxes, bringing to an end a 10-month-long corporate tax chase. 
But "the check arrived in the mail," said <PERSON>Stephen Kidder</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> Commissioner of Revenue. 
Mercedes-Benz, which had said it didn't owe taxes to <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> partly because it sells its cars at a dock in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> and not in <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, didn't explain its change of heart. 
<ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION> also agreed to pay taxes owed for the years 1986 through 1988, <PERSON>Mr. Kidder</PERSON> added. 
The <LOCATION>Clarksburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>W.Va.</LOCATION>, producer of gas and oil, said it wants shareholders to approve the split because it would "enhance the marketability" and trading of the stock.
For example, one of my favorite movies is the 1949 British comedy "Kind Hearts and Coronets," in which the entire comedy is based on actor <ORGANIZATION>Dennis Price</ORGANIZATION>'s murdering eight titled relatives (all played by <PERSON>Alec Guinness</PERSON>) because they snubbed his mother and stand in the way of his acquiring the family title.
<PERSON>Ronald J. Taylor</PERSON>, 48, was named chairman of this insurance firm's reinsurance brokerage group and its major unit, <ORGANIZATION>G.L. Hodson & Son Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Robert G. Hodson</PERSON>, 65, retired as chairman but will remain a consultant.
<PERSON>Stephen A. Crane</PERSON>, 44, senior vice president and chief financial and planning officer of the parent, was named president and chief executive of the brokerage group and the unit, succeeding <PERSON>Mr. Taylor</PERSON>.
<ORGANIZATION>Corroon</ORGANIZATION> said it will announce a successor to <PERSON>Mr. Crane</PERSON> at a later date. 
They are: "A Payroll to Meet: A Story of Greed, Corruption and Football at SMU" (<ORGANIZATION>Macmillan</ORGANIZATION>, 221 pages, $18.95) by <PERSON>David Whitford</PERSON>; "Big Red Confidential: Inside Nebraska Football" (Contemporary, 231 pages, $17.95) by <PERSON>Armen Keteyian</PERSON>; and "Never Too Young to Die: The Death of Len Bias" (<ORGANIZATION>Pantheon</ORGANIZATION>, 252 pages, $18.95) by <PERSON>Lewis Cole</PERSON>. 
It chronicles how, over a period of a dozen years, <ORGANIZATION>Southern Methodist University</ORGANIZATION> bought its way to football respectability in the <ORGANIZATION>Southwest Conference</ORGANIZATION>, only to find itself trapped and strangled by the athlete-payoff system it created.
The man who brought the bribe to the <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> school was <PERSON>Ron Meyer</PERSON>, a flashy sort who came in 1975 to rescue a woebegone program, <PERSON>Mr. Whitford</PERSON> writes.
There's a memorable passage in which <PERSON>Mr. Shields</PERSON>, having finally learned of the practice, expresses his outrage to <PERSON>Bill Clements</PERSON>, then a university governor (and now the governor of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>!) and oil <PERSON>man Edwin Cox</PERSON>, chairman of the board of trustees. 
"You stay out of it," author <LOCATION>Whitford</LOCATION> quotes <PERSON>Mr. Clements</PERSON> as saying. "Go run the university." Which was about what <PERSON>Mr. Shields</PERSON> did, and quietly, until he resigned a few years later, pleading ill health, when the stuff hit the fan. 
<PERSON>Mr. Whitford</PERSON> drew on voluminous news media coverage of the <ORGANIZATION>SMU</ORGANIZATION> scandal, and on a university internal investigation.
<PERSON>Mr. Keteyian</PERSON> had to do most of his own digging on <ORGANIZATION>University of Nebraska</ORGANIZATION> football, which is, to date, high and dry as far as the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> is concerned.
Unfortunately, he gets low grades as an investigative reporter, relying heavily on what <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s late mayor, <PERSON>Richard J. Daley</PERSON>, called "insinuendo." 
Discrepancies go unexplained in "Confidential" (one ex-player claims he received $4,000 to $5,000 for his season football tickets while others said theirs brought only a few hundred dollars), and when <PERSON>Mr. Keteyian</PERSON> can't nail down something, like who really owned a car driven by <PERSON>Husker</PERSON> tailback <PERSON>Doug Dubose</PERSON>, he simply reprints his notes. 
A serious charge -- that star flanker <PERSON>Irving Fryar</PERSON> "threw" the 1984 Orange Bowl game by intentionally dropping a pass in the end zone -- is included, even though the <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> assistant coach quoted denied making it. 
<PERSON>Dean Steinkuhler</PERSON>, a spectacularly bulked-up former lineman, confesses that he used 'em, and says other <PERSON>Huskers</PERSON> did too.
<ORGANIZATION>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> said it awarded <ORGANIZATION>General Dynamics Corp.</ORGANIZATION> a $64 million contract to launch the Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite in June 1990. 
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION>General Dynamics</ORGANIZATION> will launch CRRES using an <ORGANIZATION>Atlas</ORGANIZATION> 1 rocket. 
Two old friends, <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> and <PERSON>Deng Xiaoping</PERSON>, are trying to limit further damage to <LOCATION>U.S.-China</LOCATION> ties.
But as <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> prepares a fresh package of sanctions against <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>, the already-tense relationship could get worse. 
The problem for <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> will be to weigh what <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is saying to its people against the more conciliatory message it is delivering to the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration. 
In a move apparently aimed at heading off new punitive legislation, <PERSON>Mr. Deng</PERSON> sent an indirect signal to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> via <PERSON>T.D. Lee</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Columbia University</ORGANIZATION> physicist who met <PERSON>Mr. Deng</PERSON> and other Chinese leaders in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> last month.
When he met with <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> on his return, <PERSON>Mr. Lee</PERSON> says, he told the president that the Chinese "made statements to me that I regard as a first step toward reconciliation." 
The communication <PERSON>Mr. Lee</PERSON> brought represents the softer line the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> has been hoping to hear from <LOCATION>Chinese</LOCATION> officials since the June 4 massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>. 
The Chinese leader, <PERSON>Mr. Lee</PERSON> informed <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>, expressed some regret for what had happened in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> and conceded that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s officials bore some responsibility.
<PERSON>Mr. Lee</PERSON> says <PERSON>Mr. Deng</PERSON> told him: "We should not mind those who participated in demonstrations, signed anti-government materials and went on hunger strikes." <PERSON>Mr. Deng</PERSON> added, says <PERSON>Mr. Lee</PERSON>, that "we really made mistakes.
<PERSON>Mr. Lee</PERSON> also reported to the president that, in a separate meeting, <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON>Jiang Zemin</PERSON> said the <LOCATION>Chinese</LOCATION> leadership "looked kindly on the students who took part in the demonstrations." <PERSON>Mr. Jiang</PERSON> also pledged that the <ORGANIZATION>Chinese Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> would publish "very soon" a list of those killed.
But, he adds, "I was not acting as a messenger." He says that the <LOCATION>Chinese</LOCATION> never asked him to convey their statements to President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, but that the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spontaneously invited him to do so.
<PERSON>Mr. Lee</PERSON> concedes the statements made to him are far different from others being issued in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, but attributes that to the fact that the situation in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is "very complex." 
According to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sources in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>, the administration hopes <PERSON>Mr. Deng</PERSON>'s fairly conciliatory comments will prod <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to be cautious about further sanctions against <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>. "The president doesn't want to have legislative sanctions," says a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official. "But he may not have a choice." 
Given <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s far-from-conciliatory statements to its own people, <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> may be unable to prevent new sanctions.
What's more, much of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s official rhetoric is hostile to the <LOCATION>U.S. China</LOCATION> frequently lambastes the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Embassy for harboring astrophysicist <PERSON>Fang Lizhi</PERSON>, a political dissident who took refuge there after the massacre. "In the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, there are still people who want to crush <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and interfere in our internal affairs," <PERSON>Zhu Qizhen</PERSON>, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s new ambassador to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, said as he left for <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> last week. 
The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> are to begin soon hashing out an agreement for sanctions legislation.
It will probably be attached to a <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> authorization bill, which <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> isn't expected to veto.
Measures already in effect that are expected to be made law include a ban on military sales and exchanges, a suspension of most high-level government contacts and a halt to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade enhancement programs, such as the <ORGANIZATION>Overseas Private Investment Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Trade Development Program</ORGANIZATION>. 
Codifying those sanctions could prompt <LOCATION>Chinese</LOCATION> retaliation. "If the two sides aren't careful, <LOCATION>U.S.-China</LOCATION> ties could spin downward, out of control," says a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>. "<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and <PERSON>Deng</PERSON> are hoping {that} cooler heads prevail." 
<PERSON>H. Marshall Schwarz</PERSON> was named chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Trust Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a private-banking firm with assets under management of about $17 billion. 
<PERSON>Mr. Schwarz</PERSON>, 52 years old, will succeed <PERSON>Daniel P. Davison</PERSON> Feb. 1, soon after <PERSON>Mr. Davison</PERSON> reaches the company's mandatory retirement age of 65.
<PERSON>Mr. Schwarz</PERSON>, who is president of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Trust, will be succeeded in that post by <PERSON>Jeffrey S. Maurer</PERSON>, 42, who is executive vice president in charge of the company's asset-management group. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Trust, a 136-year-old institution that is one of the earliest high-net worth banks in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, has faced intensifying competition from other firms that have established, and heavily promoted, private-banking businesses of their own.
But <PERSON>Mr. Schwarz</PERSON> welcomes the competition in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Trust's flagship businesses, calling it "flattery." <PERSON>Mr. Schwarz</PERSON> says the competition "broadens the base of opportunity for us." Other firms "are dealing with the masses.
The new services allow <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Trust to cater to the "new wealth," <PERSON>Mr. Schwarz</PERSON> says. 
<PERSON>Mr. Schwarz</PERSON> also said costs associated with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Trust's planned move to midtown <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Wall Street</LOCATION> will continue to be a drag on earnings through 1990. 
<PERSON>Mr. Schwarz</PERSON>'s great-grandfather founded the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> toy store <PERSON>F.A.O. Schwarz</PERSON>, but his family no longer has ties to the company.
<PERSON>Mr. Schwarz</PERSON>'s father was a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Trust trustee until 1974. 
<PERSON>Donald M. Roberts</PERSON>, 54, treasurer, and <PERSON>Frederick S. Wonham</PERSON>, 58, who takes responsibility for the funds-service group, were named vice chairmen and will serve in the office of the chairman.
<PERSON>Mr. Roberts</PERSON> continues as treasurer, and <PERSON>Mr. Wonham</PERSON> remains responsible for the offices of comptroller, planning, marketing and general services. 
While <PERSON>Westinghouse</PERSON> hasn't had a nuclear power plant order from a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> utility in about a decade, excess capacity is beginning to shrink.
The company's ability to respond to energy needs world-wide will be enhanced through a recently announced venture with <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Heavy Industries</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Lego</PERSON> said. 
<PERSON>Mr. Marous</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Westinghouse</ORGANIZATION> would own 70% of the facility.
Company officials also said that any gain from the sale of <ORGANIZATION>Westinghouse</ORGANIZATION>'s 55% stake in its transmission and distribution venture with the Swiss firm of <ORGANIZATION>Asea Brown Boveri</ORGANIZATION> will be offset by a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter.
<ORGANIZATION>Castle Harlan Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> merchant bank, and Quantum Fund said they would acquire the assets for a combination of cash and the assumption of certain of <LOCATION>Sharon</LOCATION>'s liabilities.
Castle <PERSON>Harlan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Quantum</PERSON> said the plan is expected to be filed within 60 days with the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Bankruptcy Court</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>.
Castle <PERSON>Harlan</PERSON> said that such financing is already being sought and that a formal proposal would be made to <LOCATION>Sharon</LOCATION>'s Chapter 11 trustee and other <PERSON>Sharon</PERSON> creditors over the next few days. 
<LOCATION>Sharon</LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION>Farrell</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, filed for protection from creditors under the federal Bankruptcy Code in April 1987.

If <ORGANIZATION>MGM Grand Inc.</ORGANIZATION> proceeds with its plan for an amusement park -- a $700 million movieland resort with a working studio, casino and 5,000-room hotel that would become <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>'s biggest -- the investment in the three properties will total some $1.6 billion.
<PERSON>Stephen A. Wynn</PERSON>, who owns 29.4% of <ORGANIZATION>Golden Nugget</ORGANIZATION>'s shares, says the Mirage and other projects will help <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> attract a whole new generation of visitors. "If you create a wonderment, if you create something so exciting that the public dreams of being part of it, then they'll come," he says.
Nobody yet seems to have calculated the total number of slot machines, crap tables or roulette wheels <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> will add to the enormous store that Lady <PERSON>Luck</PERSON> already guards here, much less the ultimate impact of the growth on schools and municipal services. 
"Traffic is certainly a concern, as is pollution, water and an adequate labor market," says <PERSON>Frank Sain</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Bureau</ORGANIZATION>.
City fathers have managed to push through projects that are crucial for tourist growth, such as the expansion of <ORGANIZATION>McCarran International Airport</ORGANIZATION> to accommodate the 44% of <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> tourists who fly here.
Golden Nugget, <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's first casino client, has borrowed on more than $600 million worth of mortgage notes, mostly sold to private investors by <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION>, to build the Mirage.
Other casino owners, <LOCATION>Circus Circus</LOCATION> among them, are financing their expansion with their own cash and revolving credit lines from local lenders such as <ORGANIZATION>First Interstate Bank of Nevada</ORGANIZATION>. 
"If you build a better mousetrap, it will catch more mice," says <PERSON>Fred Benninger</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>MGM Grand</ORGANIZATION>.

<LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION> casino owner <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> is scouting the <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> market with an eye toward building an appropriately spectacular place. 
Many blue-collar customers of downtown's no-frills gambling spots have been lured to the Strip or to <LOCATION>Laughlin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>, a <LOCATION>Colorado River</LOCATION> town catering to snowbirds and the recreational-vehicle crowd.
Many people here expect a room-rate war as the new projects open. "There's probably going to be some pressure on occupancy and room rates over the next year, but after that you should see the market return to 80%-plus occupancy and regular rates," says <PERSON>Paul Rubeli</PERSON>, casino executive at <ORGANIZATION>Ramada Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which runs the <LOCATION>Tropicana</LOCATION>. 
Bally bought the former <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION> Grand hotel-casino from <PERSON>Kirk Kerkorian</PERSON> four years ago.
It has a "great location, but they're going to have some real problems when everyone around them opens," says <PERSON>Daniel Lee</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> analyst.
Any hotel-casino without a strong identity will get whacked by the new competition, says <PERSON>Glenn Schaeffer</PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Circus Circus</ORGANIZATION>. "If you don't know what you are, bigger won't make you better," he says. "But it'll sure make you poorer." 
Instead, they are spending to reinforce the identity that they believe attracts their customers. "More rooms aren't the answer for us," says <ORGANIZATION>Caesars World</ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON>Henry Gluck</PERSON>.
<ORGANIZATION>Caesars</ORGANIZATION> has made a specialty of catering to high rollers from abroad, who are also being aggressively courted by the Mirage, the Las <PERSON>Vegas Hilton</PERSON> and others.
Other, smaller concerns are also pursuing market niches -- Hawaiian tourists, for example, or the local trade. "There's still room for boutique properties," says <PERSON>James Barrett</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>MarCor Resorts Inc</ORGANIZATION>. Off the Strip, <ORGANIZATION>MarCor</ORGANIZATION> is building the <LOCATION>Rio</LOCATION>, a hotel-casino with a Brazilian theme and only 430 rooms -- all of them suites. 
The recent bids for <ORGANIZATION>United and American Airlines</ORGANIZATION> have led <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to move with supersonic speed to protect incumbent airline managements.
The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to vote today on an anti-airline-takeover bill that would block, for up to 50 days, any bid for 15% or more of a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> airline, even a straight cash purchase.
Transportation Secretary <PERSON>Sam Skinner</PERSON>, who earlier fueled the anti-takeover fires with his quasi-xenophobic attacks on foreign investment in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> carriers, now says the bill would further disturb the jittery capital markets.
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>Steve Bartlett</PERSON>, who has 40,000 <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION> workers in his district, says the bill is "good politics, but bad law." It is ironic that at a time when <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s partial airline deregulation is being emulated by governments from <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Ethiopia</LOCATION>, so many in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> favor an incumbent-protection program for airlines that would be more appropriate for the Soviet airline, <LOCATION>Aeroflot</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Burmah Oil PLC</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> independent oil company, said its West German subsidiary <ORGANIZATION>Castrol</ORGANIZATION> has a 49% share in Explonaft G.m.b.
<LOCATION>Burmah</LOCATION>, which has a strong market position supplying marine lubricants and metal-working fluids in <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, described the joint venture as "fairly small." It didn't provide details of setup costs. 
Although their ads picture curvy young people in skimpy outfits, club owners know the future lies with the lumpier over-40 set.

But there is a small risk that some were imported with high radiation levels." <PERSON>Mr. Hickey</PERSON> added that the stones found in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> are thought to carry double the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> radiation limit, although he noted that double or even triple the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> limit is "still in the range of safe levels." Some jewelers have Geiger counters to measure topaz radiation.

<ORGANIZATION>Cineplex Odeon Corp.</ORGANIZATION> directors said the company's chairman and chief executive, <PERSON>Garth Drabinsky</PERSON>, is considering bidding 780.6 million Canadian dollars (US$666 million) to acquire the company. 
The board said <PERSON>Mr. Drabinsky</PERSON> and Vice Chairman <PERSON>Myron Gottlieb</PERSON> are negotiating financing before offering C$16.40 a share to acquire all of <ORGANIZATION>Cineplex</ORGANIZATION>'s shares outstanding.
<PERSON>Drabinsky</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gottlieb</PERSON> mail an offer to shareholders by Nov. 22, it will reimburse them a maximum of C$8.5 million for expenses related to a bid. 
"We consider that his bid is an acceptable bid," said <PERSON>Sandra Kolber</PERSON>, spokeswoman for the independent directors' committee appointed last May to solicit and review bids for the company in the wake of a dispute between <PERSON>Mr. Drabinsky</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Cineplex</ORGANIZATION>'s major shareholder, <ORGANIZATION>MCA Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Cineplex</ORGANIZATION>'s other major shareholder, Montreal-based financier <PERSON>Charles Bronfman</PERSON> and his associates, have agreed to tender their holdings to an offer by <PERSON>Mr. Drabinsky</PERSON> unless a higher offer is made by another bidder.
<ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> holds half of <ORGANIZATION>Cineplex</ORGANIZATION>'s equity and 33% of its voting rights through restricted voting shares, while <PERSON>Bronfman</PERSON> interests hold about 24% of the company's equity. 
"All this has really established is that <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Bronfmans</LOCATION> have agreed on a price at which they can be bought out," said <PERSON>Jeffery Logsdon</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Crowell, Weedon</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. "If a bid materializes at that price, shareholders will have every reason to be glad, but the question of financing still remains." 
Last April, <PERSON>Mr. Drabinsky</PERSON> and a group of financial backers planned to acquire up to 30.2% of <ORGANIZATION>Cineplex</ORGANIZATION> for C$17.50 a share from <LOCATION>Bronfman</LOCATION> associates.
The directors didn't indicate the source of financing for <PERSON>Mr. Drabinsky</PERSON>'s new proposal, but said <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Bronfman</LOCATION> associates agreed in principle to buy for $57 million and then lease back to <LOCATION>Cineplex</LOCATION> its 18-screen theater complex in <LOCATION>Universal City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, if <PERSON>Mr. Drabinsky</PERSON> succeeds in an offer. 
In addition, the directors said if a bid by <PERSON>Mr. Drabinsky</PERSON> is successful, <ORGANIZATION>Cineplex</ORGANIZATION> expects <ORGANIZATION>Rank Organisation PLC</ORGANIZATION> to acquire the 51% of <ORGANIZATION>Cineplex's Film House</ORGANIZATION> unit it doesn't own, and provide <PERSON>Mr. Drabinsky</PERSON> with additional loan financing. 
<PERSON>Michael Gifford</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Rank</ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive, said the British theater chain's total involvement "wouldn't exceed $100 million" but declined to give a breakdown between the loan financing and the proposed <ORGANIZATION>Film House</ORGANIZATION> purchase. 
In trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Cineplex</ORGANIZATION> closed at $11, down 25 cents, with more than a million shares changing hands.

"Where's the bid?" asked <PERSON>Pierre Panet-Raymond</PERSON>, an analyst and broker with <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> securities dealer <ORGANIZATION>McDermid St. Lawrence Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Panet-Raymond</PERSON> said he doesn't think Messrs.
<PERSON>Drabinsky</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gottlieb</PERSON> are "anywhere close" to arranging financing and that investors will need a solid offer before the stock begins to rise again. 
Finnish conglomerate <ORGANIZATION>Nokia Oy AB</ORGANIZATION> said it reached an agreement to buy Dutch cable company <ORGANIZATION>NKF Kabel B.V.</ORGANIZATION> for 420 million Finnish markka ($99.5 million).

Some of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s biggest trading partners gave a quick thumbs-down to a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> proposal to liberalize world trade and reduce farm-product subsidies. 
In <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION>, where world trade talks are being held under the <ORGANIZATION>General Agreement on Tariffs</ORGANIZATION> and Trade, or <ORGANIZATION>GATT</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> called the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> proposal "a step backward." And <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries told a committee of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s parliament that <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s proposal was impractical and that <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> would continue to heavily subsidize its rice farmers. 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, in a far-reaching plan submitted to the <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> meeting Tuesday, proposed curbing price support subsidies within 10 years and eliminating export subsidies within five years.
But the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> reacted defiantly, arguing that the proposal's main aim is to destroy the Common Agricultural Policy, the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>'s $28 billion-a-year price support program. "The <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> proposal is not an adequate basis for negotiation," the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. 
<ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> officials say they are irked that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> has set a specific timetable and is insisting on the "elimination" of export subsides, not just reduction.
<ORGANIZATION>EC Agriculture Commissioner</ORGANIZATION> <PERSON>Ray MacSharry</PERSON> said the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> plan "calls into question" the agreement reached by world negotiators last April in <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> seeking "substantial progressive reductions in agricultural support and protection." 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Deputy Trade Representative <PERSON>Jules Katz</PERSON> replied that the proposal was entirely consistent with the April accord.
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> proposal also was criticized by food-importing developing countries, who said that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> made no special allowances for poor nations.
Ambassador <PERSON>Katz</PERSON> said the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> was open to discussing particular problems of developing countries. 
Seeking to allay <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> concerns, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Agriculture Secretary <PERSON>Clayton Yeutter</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> that the new <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> plan wouldn't "put farmers out of business" but would encourage them to "grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants." 
The <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>, with a population of 320 million, has 8.5 million farmers, while the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, with a population of about 245 million, has only two million farmers. 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s objections to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> plan center around its desire to stay self-sufficient in rice, a staple food, even though foreign producers are far more efficient. 
But July 5, a thunderstorm in <LOCATION>Wilmington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Del.</LOCATION>, caused <ORGANIZATION>Shellpot Creek</ORGANIZATION> to rise 15 feet, pouring 1.3 million gallons of water into basement vaults.
The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Mint</ORGANIZATION> wouldn't take the coin because it wasn't mutilated, and the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Bank</ORGANIZATION> accepts only clean coins, he says. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Philadelphia Fed</ORGANIZATION> says it is merely an "agent" for coins, responsible only for storage and distribution. "We issue paper money; we destroy paper money," says <PERSON>Jane Hinkle</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Philadelphia Fed</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. "The coin is their problem." 
But <PERSON>Brooks</PERSON> declined, figuring that transporting the mucked up money to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> would cost the company thousands more. 
So <ORGANIZATION>Brooks</ORGANIZATION> gave the dirty work to <ORGANIZATION>Coin Wrap Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which came up with an unusual solution. 
Not only did his company find $20,000 worth of work, but when the approach was suggested, <PERSON>Mr. String</PERSON> says, <ORGANIZATION>Brooks</ORGANIZATION> officials "didn't laugh at me or anything." 
The average unemployment rate in the 15 biggest industrialized democracies was steady in August at the 6.1% rate of the two previous months, the <ORGANIZATION>Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>OECD</ORGANIZATION>) said. 
Assets of the 400 taxable funds tracked by <ORGANIZATION>IBC/Donoghue</ORGANIZATION>'s Money Fund Report jumped to $351.2 billion in the week ended Tuesday, the <LOCATION>Holliston</LOCATION>, Mass.-based newsletter said.
The average yield on six-month CDs of $50,000 or less at major banks was 7.96% in the week ended Tuesday, according to <ORGANIZATION>Banxquote Money Markets</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> information service. 
"They're anticipating further declines in rates and they're going to get them, slowly," said <PERSON>Walter Frank</PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION>Donoghue Organization</ORGANIZATION>, publisher of Money Fund Report. 
French President <PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>European Community Commission</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Jacques Delors</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Spanish</LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON>Felipe Gonzalez</PERSON> and others have begun linking the rapid changes in the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> to the need to speed up changes in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>.
They are stressing that the best way for the West to help the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> is to move faster towards <LOCATION>Western European</LOCATION> economic and monetary unity.
"The only response to the challenge being presented to us by the East," <PERSON>Mr. Mitterrand</PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION>European Parliament</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Strasbourg</LOCATION> yesterday, "is to reinforce and accelerate the union and cohesion of the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>." <PERSON>Mr. Mitterrand</PERSON> proposed that a conference be convened next fall to write a new treaty for the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> allowing a European central bank, and that the treaty be ratified by 1992.
<PERSON>Mr. Mitterrand</PERSON> also proposed a separate "Bank for <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>" that would channel development money to the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION>. 
One basis for linking change in the East and change in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> is the notion that integrating 110 million Eastern Europeans with 320 million Western Europeans is primarily the task of Europeans, despite the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>'s obvious strategic and economic interest.
Says a <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> strategist: "The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> tends to look at <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION> {not including the Soviet Union} as <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> looks at <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>: important but far away.
There is likely to be a natural division of labor, says <PERSON>Francois Heisbourg</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>International Institute for Strategic Studies</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> more engaged in strategic issues with the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION> more involved with specific aid measures for the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION>. 
The designation at July's economic summit of major industrialized nations of the <ORGANIZATION>EC Commission</ORGANIZATION> as coordinator of Western aid to <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> was a first step.
In part, this division is dictated by economics: <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> is a net exporter of capital while the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> isn't.
While American aid efforts have been limited by budget problems, yesterday <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> announced a three-year, four billion French franc ($650 million) aid plan for <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>. 
Despite sudden changes in the strategic equation, some Western European leaders, especially British Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON>, remain skeptical about <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> political and economic unity, and are unlikely to let <ORGANIZATION>East-West</ORGANIZATION> concerns change their minds.
"We need a Western Ostpolitik," says <PERSON>John Roper</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Institute of International Affairs</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, referring to <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>'s longstanding policy of a diplomatic opening to the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION>. "For <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> we need to think about a stick-and-carrot economic approach that would force them to price things realistically in return for removing all our tariff barriers." He notes that the Marshall Plan of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> "didn't just throw money at post-war <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, it also liberalized and opened up those markets." 
The <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> analysis goes further. "Most of the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>'s leaders have finally concluded that we all want perestroika {Soviet leader <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON>'s policy of economic restructuring} to succeed," says <PERSON>Hubert Vedrine</PERSON>, security adviser to <PERSON>Mr. Mitterrand</PERSON>. "But they haven't yet drawn the operational policy conclusions." 
He adds that with communism collapsing and <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON> scrambling to rejuvenate the Soviet economy, "Our interest lies in a controlled transformation, a contained nuclear reaction, so we need to help him, and not just with words." Managing change, he adds, will require a lot more aid and a prominent role for the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>, especially in dealing with the question of German reunification. 
<PERSON>Thierry de Montbrial</PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION>French Institutue</LOCATION> for International Relations in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, says it isn't clear what, exactly, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> wants.
Any push for a <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> vision of a "common European home," implying the eventual dissolution of the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>, a Soviet-German partnership and the withdrawal of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> forces, "would be a very, very serious problem," he says.
He doubts a <LOCATION>Bismarckian</LOCATION> super state will emerge that would dominate <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, but warns of "a risk of profound change in the heart of the European Community from a <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> that is too strong, even if democratic." 
While many commentators, particularly <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> ones, worry that hasty and emotional reaction to the changes in the East might lead to dangerous pressures for a denuclearized <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> or the speeded-up withdrawal of <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> troops, <PERSON>Mr. Roper</PERSON> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> sees a more positive scenario. "There seems to be a message from <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> there's a deal on offer," he says. "They want reassurance we won't try to undermine or destroy the <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION> Pact. . . . In return, the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> could keep their nuclear weapons.
<ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Alan Greenspan</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> can wipe out inflation without causing a recession, but he said doing so will inflict some short-term pain and will require reducing the federal deficit sharply. 
<PERSON>Mr. Greenspan</PERSON> said he and other <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> governors endorse a bill by Rep. <PERSON>Stephen Neal</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>) that would require the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> to pursue policies aimed at eliminating inflation within five years. "Such a deadline is attainable, but it would have costs," <PERSON>Mr. Greenspan</PERSON> told Rep. <PERSON>Neal</PERSON>'s monetary policy subcommittee. 
<PERSON>Lee Hamilton</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION>) and <PERSON>Byron Dorgan</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>N.D.</LOCATION>) -- that, among other things, would require the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> to disclose all monetary policy moves immediately and increase outside scrutiny of the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>. 
In responding to questions, <PERSON>Mr. Greenspan</PERSON> played down reports of tension between the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> over exchange-rate policy. 
But the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> isn't enthusiastic about <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> efforts to bring down the value of the dollar through intervention in foreign-exchange markets, and the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> is frustrated at the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>'s reluctance to cut interest rates to pull down the dollar's value. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Greenspan</PERSON>, who has repeatedly said the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>'s goal is to reduce inflation, added that "whatever losses are incurred in the pursuing of price stability would surely be more than made up in increased output thereafter." 
Rep. <PERSON>Neal</PERSON>'s bill originally called on the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> to reduce the inflation rate by one percentage point a year for five years and to maintain a zero inflation rate thereafter.
<PERSON>Hamilton</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Dorgan</ORGANIZATION> also have altered their bill, dropping a proposal to add the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> secretary to the 12-member <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> committee that makes monetary policy.
Even that met with <PERSON>Mr. Greenspan</PERSON>'s disapproval because it might subject the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> "to a more intensely political perspective" and "could risk bending monetary policy away from long-term strategic goals." 
While each of the <ORGANIZATION>Hamilton-Dorgan</ORGANIZATION> proposals represents only a small step, together they would erode the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>'s independence, <PERSON>Mr. Greenspan</PERSON> said. 
The <ORGANIZATION>State Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s move is part of a drive to iron out exchange-rate discrepancies as <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> moves toward making the ruble convertible -- a goal that Soviet bankers and economists say is still far away.
The leveraged buy-out firm of <ORGANIZATION>Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which owns 46% of the common equity of <ORGANIZATION>SCI</ORGANIZATION> TV, indicated in the debt plan that it would reduce its equity stake to 15%, giving the rest of its stake to bondholders in the restructuring. 
<ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> also signaled to the company's creditors that <PERSON>Henry Kravis</PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> directors of <ORGANIZATION>SCI</ORGANIZATION> TV would resign from the board once the restructuring is completed and forgo their voting rights. 
Holders of <ORGANIZATION>SCI TV</ORGANIZATION>'s $507 million of high-yield junk bonds are being asked to forgive a lot of debt in exchange for taking a 39% equity stake in <ORGANIZATION>SCI TV</ORGANIZATION>.
"I think the current plan is sufficiently flawed in a sufficient number of bondholders' eyes that substantial revisions will be required to get it done," says analyst <PERSON>Craig Davis</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>R.D. Smith & Co.</ORGANIZATION> here. 
But a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> says that with only a 15% equity stake, it wouldn't be appropriate for <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> to keep board representation. 
<ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> already has made about $1 billion of gains from earlier transactions with <ORGANIZATION>SCI</ORGANIZATION> TV, thus it isn't significantly affected by the company's troubles. 
<ORGANIZATION>SCI</ORGANIZATION> TV, which is controlled by <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, entrepreneur <PERSON>George Gillett</PERSON>, owns six TV stations, including several <ORGANIZATION>CBS Inc.</ORGANIZATION> affiliates.
Through investment banker <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>SCI</ORGANIZATION> TV is offering to exchange three classes of junk bonds for packages of new bonds and equity that investors value at ranges from 20 cents to 70 cents on the dollar.
<ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> would give up a 31% equity stake to bondholders, while <PERSON>Mr. Gillett</PERSON> would surrender an 8% stake.
While one big SCI TV investor thinks that's pretty generous, many junkholders had been hoping that <ORGANIZATION>KKR</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Mr. Gillett</PERSON> would invest new money in <ORGANIZATION>SCI</ORGANIZATION> TV.
A major <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> newspaper reported that a Japanese department store concern is planning to offer about $1.3 billion to buy <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale's</ORGANIZATION>.
A spokeswoman said Toronto-based <PERSON>Campeau</PERSON> has received "expressions of interest" in <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale</ORGANIZATION>'s, but she declined to comment on whether any actual bids had been made.
<PERSON>Nihon Keizai Shimbun</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s leading economic newspaper, reported Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION>Tokyu Department Store Co.</ORGANIZATION> is planning to team up with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Western European financing to buy the New York-based retail chain, which <ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION> has put up for sale.
<LOCATION>Tokyu</LOCATION> executives weren't available for comment early Thursday morning in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, <PERSON>Robert Campeau</PERSON>, said at its annual meeting in July that he valued <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale</ORGANIZATION>'s at $2 billion.
Among previously disclosed possible bidders is <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale</ORGANIZATION>'s Chairman <PERSON>Marvin Traub</PERSON>, who has aligned himself with <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Blackstone Group</ORGANIZATION>. 
Investment bankers in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> confirmed that <ORGANIZATION>Tokyu Department Store</ORGANIZATION> is one of several Japanese companies that has been approached by representatives of a management committee headed by <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Traub</PERSON>.
"Nobody is going to make a real bid before the middle of November," said one investment banker familiar with the discussions in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. "<PERSON>Tokyu</PERSON> is one of the potential buyers who might raise its hand.
<ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale</ORGANIZATION>'s is a 17-store chain acquired last year by <ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION> in its $6.6 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Federated</ORGANIZATION>.
The sale of <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale</ORGANIZATION>'s is a condition of efforts by Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION>Olympia & York Developments Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> to arrange $800 million in bridge financing for <ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION>, which disclosed last month that its retailing units, <ORGANIZATION>Federated Department Stores Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Allied Stores Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, were strapped for cash.
O&Y, owned by <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Reichmann</PERSON> family, is also supervising major restructuring and refinancing of <LOCATION>Campeau</LOCATION>, a Toronto-based real estate and retailing company. 
One executive familiar with the <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale</ORGANIZATION>'s situation said, "No book has been issued regarding <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale</ORGANIZATION>'s, there are no projections, so I doubt very much whether any bid has been made." 
Separately, a <ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION> shareholder filed suit, charging <ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION>, Chairman <PERSON>Robert Campeau</PERSON> and other officers with violating securities law. 
The suit, filed in <ORGANIZATION>U.S. District Court</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, seeks class-action status.
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> conferees agreed to continue production of <ORGANIZATION>Grumman Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's F-14 and to provide more than $3.8 billion for the <ORGANIZATION>Strategic Defense Initiative</ORGANIZATION> during the current fiscal year. 
Industry officials and congressional aides said that the main points of a compromise defense authorization bill, hammered out during a flurry of private meetings over the past few days, provide a face-saving compromise for both the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Democrats.
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and other supporters of <ORGANIZATION>SDI</ORGANIZATION> will be able to take credit for blocking <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> efforts to significantly cut the program to develop a space-based antimissile system, which already has cost some $17 billion.
<ORGANIZATION>Senate Armed Services Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Sam Nunn</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>) and other <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> conferees have opposed the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> cuts, stalling for almost two months action on a number of big-ticket items in the Pentagon's budget. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> voted to authorize $4.5 billion for <ORGANIZATION>SDI</ORGANIZATION> spending in the current fiscal year, but the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, reflecting a dramatic erosion of support for the program, earmarked only $3.1 billion.
The decision to keep the embattled F-14's production line running for at least another year is an important victory for the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, and especially for Rep. <PERSON>Les Aspin</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION>).
As the head of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> conferees, Rep. <PERSON>Aspin</PERSON> has been under intense pressure from his colleagues to reject <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> provisions that would have abruptly cut further F-14 production. 
But as part of the overall agreement, <ORGANIZATION>Grumman</ORGANIZATION> and its outspoken supporters on <LOCATION>Capitol Hill</LOCATION> effectively will be precluded from reopening the emotional issue in the debate over next year's budget. 
<ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Dick Cheney</PERSON> and most senators contend that the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>'s F-14 is too expensive in an era of shrinking Pentagon budgets.
But the plane boasts a strong core of support in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, where members are intent on saving <PERSON>Grumman</PERSON> jobs and are worried about potential shortages of carrier-based aircraft by the late 1990s. 
Conferees also agreed to <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> requests to earmark a total of nearly $1 billion for work on both mobile MX and <LOCATION>Midgetman</LOCATION> nuclear missiles, according to congressional aides. 
And lawmakers are putting the finishing touches on a compromise that would give the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> nearly all of the $2.4 billion it wants for production of <ORGANIZATION>Northrop Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's radar-eluding B-2 bombers, which cost $530 million apiece.
The final B-2 agreement is certain to require detailed testing and verification of the bomber's capabilities, but congressional aides said the accord won't include a House-passed provision that would have withheld production funds until <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> approves a cheaper, scaled-down version of the $70 billion fleet of 132 B-2s envisioned by the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Toshiba Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said its new French marketing concern has started operating under the aegis of the company's West German subsidiary, which formerly handled all sales of <LOCATION>Toshiba</LOCATION> electronic products in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. 
A recent change in <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> law, according to <LOCATION>Toshiba</LOCATION>, permitted formation of the semiconductor marketing arm in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.

One day last March, <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> Sports President <PERSON>Neal Pilson</PERSON> and Olympics superagent <PERSON>Barry Frank</PERSON> met for lunch at the <ORGANIZATION>Lotos Club</ORGANIZATION> here.
<PERSON>Mr. Frank</PERSON> told <PERSON>Mr. Pilson</PERSON> that Olympics officials wanted $290 million or more for TV rights to the 1994 Winter Games in <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>.
At that price, <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> was the only player at the table when negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION>International Olympic Committee</ORGANIZATION> started in <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> Aug. 23.
<PERSON>Dick Pound</PERSON>, a committee member, began by disclosing that <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> had refused to even bid.
<PERSON>Mr. Pound</PERSON> responded, "It's a deal." A beaming <PERSON>Mr. Pilson</PERSON> announced his lastest coup at a news conference that afternoon. 
<PERSON>Mr. Pilson</PERSON>'s rivals at <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> grimaced at the price.
"The price of poker has gone up," crows <PERSON>Charles M. Neinas</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>College Football Association</ORGANIZATION>'s executive director. 
<ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Capital Cities/ABC Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>National Broadcasting Co.</ORGANIZATION> also risk losses if they outbid CBS for other contracts. 
Advertisers already are balking at higher prices. "The networks are paying too much for rights," warns adman <PERSON>Paul Isacsson</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Young & Rubicam</ORGANIZATION>. "If they ask advertisers to absorb the costs, they're likely to lose all but a few who need sports, above all." 
<PERSON>Mr. Pilson</PERSON> emphasizes the ancillary benefits of positive press, contented affiliate stations, enthusiastic advertisers and huge audiences that might stick around to watch other <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> programs when the game is over.
Some TV people doubt they will materialize and argue that even if they do, they won't offset the multimillion-dollar deficits that <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> could run up. "As we've seen in the '80s," says <PERSON>Roger Werner</PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION>ESPN</ORGANIZATION> sports channel, "those deals can turn sour if the numbers don't work.
<ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> pursues top sports "to belie the fact that they aren't supporting affiliates, viewers and advertisers," charges <PERSON>Thomas H. Wyman</PERSON>, who was ousted as chairman of <ORGANIZATION>CBS Inc.</ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON>Laurence A. Tisch</PERSON> bought a 24.9% stake in the company and took over three years ago. "They lost the entertainment crown, and they needed one.
That's well over half a billion dollars more than <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> were willing to pay. (After 1992, the winter and summer Olympics will be held two years apart, with the revised schedule beginning with the winter games in 1994 and the summer games in 1996.) 
A few months later, <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>'s college and pro football contracts come up for renewal; they could go for close to $100 million more than <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> now pays, a 40% to 50% rise. 
"What happens to those two basketball contracts will shape the next five years of network sports," says <PERSON>Peter Lund</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>CBS Sports</ORGANIZATION> president now at <ORGANIZATION>Multimedia Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>J. William Grimes</PERSON>, former president of <ORGANIZATION>ESPN</ORGANIZATION>, says <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> may "come in with a huge bid for college basketball to take it away from <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> and say, 'We can overbid, too. ' And the winners will be the colleges, not either network.
In the mid-1980s, after <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> had just bid a record $309 million for the 1988 Winter Games, he sniped at rivals for paying reckless prices. "I love <PERSON>Pilson</PERSON>, but he was the guy who complained most bitterly and loudly," says <PERSON>Robert Wussler</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>CBS Sports</ORGANIZATION> president. "And yet his company is one reason why rights are so high today." Rivals carp at "the principle of Pilson," as <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Arthur Watson</PERSON> once put it -- "he's always expounding that rights are too high, then he's going crazy." 
A <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> law school graduate, he began his career in corporate law and then put in years at <ORGANIZATION>Metromedia Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>William Morris</ORGANIZATION> talent agency.
And he isn't the only big spender: <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> will pay a record $401 million for the 1992 Summer Games, and <ORGANIZATION>ESPN</ORGANIZATION>, 80%-owned by <ORGANIZATION>Capital Cities/ABC</ORGANIZATION>, will shell out $400 million for four years of baseball, airing 175 regular-season games a year. 
<PERSON>Mr. Pilson</PERSON>'s "Major Events" strategy jelled after <PERSON>Mr. Tisch</PERSON> took over.
<PERSON>Mr. Pilson</PERSON> recalls that in April 1986, after <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, he and <PERSON>Mr. Tisch</PERSON> took the 90-minute train ride back to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Mr. Pilson</PERSON> used this extended private audience to outline his ambitions.
Five months later, <PERSON>Mr. Tisch</PERSON> took over as <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive, and soon he was wielding sole approval each time <PERSON>Mr. Pilson</PERSON> scribbled a frighteningly large figure on a slip of paper, sealed it in an envelope and gave it to sports negotiators. 
<PERSON>Mr. Pilson</PERSON> gave him one: He bid $243 million for rights to the 1992 Winter Games in <LOCATION>Albertville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> wouldn't bid even $200 million.
The "Major Events" strategy, <PERSON>Mr. Pilson</PERSON> says, is designed to notch a place for <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> on the crowded TV dial of the 1990s.
"I've been struggling against that for years," says <PERSON>Jonathan Rodgers</PERSON>, who runs WBBM-TV, the CBS-owned station in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>.
Even if baseball triggers losses at <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> -- and he doesn't think it will -- "I'd rather see the games on our air than on <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>," he says. 
<PERSON>Mr. Pilson</PERSON> says baseball and the Olympics may help <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> move up to No. 2 in the household ratings race, putting pizazz back into the network's image.
<ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> will air the Super Bowl, baseball playoffs, college and pro basketball finals and other premier sports events. "It's made me more committed to <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>," says <PERSON>Philip A. Jones</PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION>Meredith Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's broadcast group, which has two <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> affiliates. 
No amount of hype will bring viewers back if the shows are weak. "In this market of 40 channels, sophisticated viewers and the remote control, trial isn't a guarantee of anything," <ORGANIZATION>ESPN</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Werner</PERSON> says. "If the show ain't a killer, they're gone." 
But <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> will put the athletes up against <PERSON>Bill Cosby</PERSON>, "Cheers" and other shows in <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s No. 1 schedule. 
It alone isn't likely to stop a station from dumping <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> shows. "The World Series, seven nights, wasn't enough of an incentive," says <PERSON>Arnold Klinsky</PERSON> of WHEC-TV in <LOCATION>Rochester</LOCATION>, which dropped <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> six weeks ago. "You've got to judge where the network will be in three years." 
On the $1.06 billion baseball agreement alone, <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> is likely to lose $250 million in four years, contends <PERSON>Mr. Wussler</PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> man, now at <ORGANIZATION>Comsat Inc</ORGANIZATION>. Nevertheless, he deems the deal "plain smart" for its huge promotional value. 
<PERSON>Mr. Pilson</PERSON> calls that loss estimate "wildly inaccurate," conceding only that <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> will lose money on baseball in the first year. "It's too early to tell" what happens after that, he says.
But <PERSON>Mr. Tisch</PERSON> expects losses in all four years of the contract, he told <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> senators last June. 
<ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> will pay an average of $82 million more each year than <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> had paid together -- and those two networks expect losses on baseball this season.
Yet <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> will air only 12 regular-season games, 26 fewer than <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> signed <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION> to be the only auto-maker sponsors in baseball for four years.
All prime-time fare will be on tape-delay because of time differences with <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>, so the results can be announced on the 6 o'clock news. (<ORGANIZATION>Turner Broadcasting</ORGANIZATION> will pay CBS $25 million to air 50 hours of <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> coverage plus 50 hours of additional events.) 
<PERSON>Barry Frank</PERSON>, the agent who took <PERSON>Mr. Pilson</PERSON> to lunch last March, says that even if <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> loses, say, $10 million, it matters little. "Ten million ain't jack, man, when you got $3 billion sitting in the bank," says <PERSON>Mr. Frank</PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION>International Management Group</ORGANIZATION>, citing <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>'s enormous cash reserves from selling off various businesses. "It doesn't mean anything -- it's public-relations money." 
Moreover, sports has "claimed its place" as a guaranteed ratings-getter, says <PERSON>David J. Stern</PERSON>, the commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION>National Basketball Association</ORGANIZATION>. "This isn't outlandish bidding; this is a situation of very careful businessmen making judgments about the worth of product and acting on it. . . . I would tend to trust their judgment." 
That's easy for him to say: <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>'s four-year <ORGANIZATION>NBA</ORGANIZATION> pact, now at $176 million for four years, could double in price by the time his talks with <PERSON>Mr. Pilson</PERSON> are completed later this month.
And <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> takes in the least money in prime time; <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> charge 30% to 35% more for ads, according to a <ORGANIZATION>Variety</ORGANIZATION> survey. 
But <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>'s costs are huge, and the risks go up with each new sports package that <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> locks up.
<ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> may cushion losses with about $200 million a year in interest earned on the proceeds from selling <ORGANIZATION>CBS Records</ORGANIZATION> and other businesses.
But media-stock analyst <PERSON>Richard J. MacDonald</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>MacDonald Grippo Riely</ORGANIZATION> says Wall Street won't take kindly to that. "On a stand-alone basis, the network ought to make money," he says. 
The Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, by a margin of 51 votes, failed to override President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s veto of legislation renewing federal support of Medicaid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape and incest. 
Yesterday's vote dealt with the largest of these bills, an estimated $156.7 billion measure funding the departments of <ORGANIZATION>Labor</ORGANIZATION>, Education, and <ORGANIZATION>Health and Human Services</ORGANIZATION>.
The action came as <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> sent to the president last night a stopgap spending bill to keep the government operating through Nov. 15 and provide $2.85 billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo and the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> earthquake.
By a lopsided 97-1 margin, the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> approved the measure after attaching further provisions sought by the influential <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> delegation and, despite reservations, the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> adopted the bill on a 303-107 roll call. 
But given the political importance of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, the administration was content to use its influence to prevent any <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> amendments adding further new appropriations.
The $2.85 billion measure comes on top of $1.1 billion appropriated after Hugo struck the <LOCATION>Carolinas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> last month, and these totals don't reflect the additional benefit of low-interest disaster loans. 
In the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, Majority Whip <PERSON>Alan Cranston</PERSON> used his position to win not only the expanded credit but also more generous treatment than the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> had permitted in the distribution of highway funds in the next six months.
The underlying stopgap bill is the second required by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> this fall and, since the current fiscal year began Oct. 1, only the Energy and <ORGANIZATION>Interior</ORGANIZATION> departments are operating on permanent appropriations enacted into law.
The standoff over abortion is certain to contribute to further delays and, apart from the health and education measure vetoed by <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>, bills funding the <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION> and the entire <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> foreign-aid budget are in jeopardy because of related abortion or family-planning issues. 
At a recent <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> meeting, Rep. <PERSON>Silvio Conte</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>), the ranking minority member of the <ORGANIZATION>House Appropriations Committee</ORGANIZATION>, argued with his friend <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> against a veto, and though <PERSON>Mr. Conte</PERSON> and Minority Leader <PERSON>Robert Michel</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> stood with the president yesterday, they are plainly uncomfortable with his position. 
"This isn't a political issue, this is a moral issue," said Rep. <PERSON>Henry Hyde</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>), the most eloquent spokesman for the anti-abortion movement.
<LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> gubernatorial candidate Rep. <PERSON>James Florio</PERSON> pointedly returned from campaigning to vote against the president yesterday in contrast with his opponent, GOP Rep. <PERSON>James Courter</PERSON>, who has ardently supported abortion restrictions in the past but was absent. 
In an extraordinary mix of cultures and church-state powers, Rep. <PERSON>Robert Dornan</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>) lectured his fellow Roman Catholics -- including <PERSON>Mr. Florio</PERSON> -- for having the "chutzpah" to disagree with the hierarchy of their church on abortion.
Rep. <PERSON>Les AuCoin</PERSON> was as blunt on behalf of the abortion-rights movement. "This may not make <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> a one-term president," said the <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> liberal, addressing the Republican side of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>. "But if you support him over rape victims, this may be your last term." 
The current ceiling on home loans insured by the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Housing Administration</ORGANIZATION> would be increased to $124,875, and the bill gives the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Housing and Urban Development</ORGANIZATION> new authority to facilitate the refinancing of subsidized loans for low-income homeowners. 
By a 325-92 margin, the <ORGANIZATION>Appropriations Committee</ORGANIZATION> leadership beat back an early challenge by <ORGANIZATION>House Banking</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Henry Gonzalez</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>) to the <ORGANIZATION>FHA</ORGANIZATION> provision.
The clinical testing services holding company is based in <LOCATION>San Juan Capistrano</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. 
"<ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> pilots have shown on a number of occasions they are willing and able to strike," said an executive at <ORGANIZATION>Fuji Bank</ORGANIZATION>, one of <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>'s large lenders. "If you have both {labor} groups on strike, you've got no revenue and that's a very scary thing for a bank to be looking at." 
Thus, even investors who are pushing for the board to do a recapitalization that would pay shareholders a special dividend and possibly grant employees an ownership stake acknowledge that the unions are key. "There's less likelihood of creating and completing a transaction without the unions' cooperation and wage concessions," said <PERSON>Richard Nye</PERSON>, of Baker, <ORGANIZATION>Nye Investments</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> takeover stock-trader.
<PERSON>Mr. Nye</PERSON> thinks the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> board should be ousted if it doesn't move soon to increase shareholder value. 
The pilots' insistence on majority ownership also may make the idea of a recapitalization difficult to achieve. "Who wants to be a public shareholder investing in a company controlled by the pilots' union?" asks <PERSON>Candace Browning</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Wertheim Schroeder & Co.</ORGANIZATION> "Who would the board be working for -- the public shareholders or the pilots?" she adds. 
The year-ago quarter's results were crimped by expenses associated with <ORGANIZATION>Spiegel</ORGANIZATION>'s $260 million acquisition of catalog-clothing-merchandiser <PERSON>Eddie Bauer</PERSON>, <PERSON>Spiegel</PERSON> noted.
<PERSON>Spiegel</PERSON> is 84%-controlled by the Otto family of <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> said it is consolidating control of its Asian operations under a new organization here that will be headed by <PERSON>W. Wayne Booker</PERSON>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford Asia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> will coordinate the activities of <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> and work with <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> business associates throughout the region.
These functions are currently performed out of <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, and at <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION>Dearborn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Booker</PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Latin America Automotive Operations</ORGANIZATION> since December 1988, was named vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Ford Asia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION>. 
But <ORGANIZATION>Coniston</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> partnership managed by the firm of <ORGANIZATION>Gollust, Tierney & Oliver</ORGANIZATION>, yesterday announced that "in view of unsettled conditions in securities markets" the offering would be postponed and restructured.
What wasn't mentioned is that <ORGANIZATION>Coniston</ORGANIZATION> and its investment banker, <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette</ORGANIZATION>, just completed a two-week "road show" for the purpose of marketing the bonds.
Its fast-food restaurants -- including <PERSON>Denny</PERSON>'s, <PERSON>Hardee</PERSON>'s, Quincy's and <PERSON>El Pollo Loco</PERSON> ("the only significant fast-food chain to specialize in char-broiled chicken") -- are stable, recession-resistant and growing.
But unless they continued to grow, TW, based in <LOCATION>Paramus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, would have run into trouble. 
Until recently, such buy-now, pray-for-growth-later deals were routine. "But people don't buy anything on expectation anymore," says <PERSON>Jack Utter</PERSON>, who manages the high-yield fund of <ORGANIZATION>IDS Financial Services</ORGANIZATION>. "Investors," he adds, "are getting religion." The TW buy-out may yet be financed. "There is nothing wrong with the company," says <ORGANIZATION>Coniston</ORGANIZATION> principal <PERSON>Paul Tierney</PERSON>.
The fast-food business is "intensely competitive," notes <PERSON>Wertheim Schroder</PERSON> analyst <PERSON>John Rohs</PERSON>.
As a presidential candidate in 1980, <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> forthrightly expressed his position on abortion in an interview with <ORGANIZATION>Rolling Stone magazine</ORGANIZATION> published that March.
A few months later, <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> became <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>'s running mate.
Suddenly, <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> the pro-choice advocate became <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> the anti-abortionist.
Anti-abortion forces regard him as at best an uncertain ally. "In all honesty if you ask me, `Is this man a true believer? ' I don't know," says <PERSON>John Fowler</PERSON>, head of the Washington-based Ad <ORGANIZATION>Hoc Committee in Defense of Life Inc</ORGANIZATION>. Yet abortion-rights forces remain bitterly critical.
<PERSON>Douglas Gould</PERSON>, vice president of communications for the <ORGANIZATION>Planned Parenthood Federation of America</ORGANIZATION>, calls <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>'s position on the abortion-funding issue "extremely cruel," adding: "The guy hasn't done one thing about prevention.
The political risk would be far less if the president drew a firm line and hewed to it, experts insist. "If you have a position, you're better off to stick with it than to move around very much," says <ORGANIZATION>Republican</ORGANIZATION> strategist <PERSON>John Sears</PERSON>.
The need for consistency is especially acute for <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>, who, <PERSON>Mr. Sears</PERSON> maintains, lacks a strong ideological base. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> and his advisers miscalculated the politics of the abortion issue, failing to grasp how dramatically the abortion-rights movement would be aroused following last summer's <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> decision to restrict those rights in the <PERSON>Webster</PERSON> case. 
"It was one of the quickest changes in public attitudes I've ever seen," says former <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> pollster <PERSON>Richard Wirthlin</PERSON>. 
In 1974, as the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> representative to the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>, he wrote an introduction to a book on world population in which he boasted of his leadership during his term in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in expanding family-planning services for the poor.
In his <ORGANIZATION>Rolling Stone</ORGANIZATION> interview in 1980, <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> volunteered his abortion-rights remarks to contrast himself with his rival, <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>.
<ORGANIZATION>Wade Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> decision legalizing abortion, <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> said he opposed the constitutional ban on abortion that <PERSON>Mr. Reagan</PERSON> was promising to promote. 
As <PERSON>Mr. Reagan</PERSON>'s running mate, though, <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> plunged headlong into the anti-abortion position, endorsing a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion.
He did later threaten vetoes over legislation restoring the <LOCATION>District of Columbia</LOCATION>'s right to use its own tax money to fund abortions for poor women and over restoring funding to the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> Population Fund.
What few comments he has initiated have been oblique, such as urging "greater efforts toward the protection of human life" at a meeting of <ORGANIZATION>Catholic</ORGANIZATION> lawyers in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> last month. 
The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> has likewise avoided any involvement in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s recent special legislative session on abortion, which anti-abortion forces had regarded as a key test of their ability to get state lawmakers to toughen abortion restrictions.
<PERSON>Ken Ruberg</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Republican Mainstream Committee</ORGANIZATION>, a group of party moderates, observes: "The administration finds itself in an ideological cul de sac that it will find it difficult -- if not impossible -- to get itself out of." 
<PERSON>Mr. Tucker</PERSON>, 44 years old, is president of <ORGANIZATION>Trivest Securities Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Trivest Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, closely held investment companies based in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Torchmark</PERSON> also said that <PERSON>Samuel E. Upchurch Jr.</PERSON>, 37, vice president and general counsel, was selected to serve the remainder of the term vacated by <PERSON>John S.P. Samford</PERSON>, who resigned as director. 
<PERSON>Rupert Murdoch</PERSON> acquired a 25% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Grupo Zeta S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, the leading Spanish magazine and newspaper publisher said. 
The transaction called for <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>News International PLC</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of Australia-based <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, to subscribe to a rights issue by <ORGANIZATION>Zeta</ORGANIZATION> valued at 6.65 billion pesetas ($57 million).
The cash injection boosted <LOCATION>Zeta</LOCATION>'s capital more than four-fold, to 8.47 billion pesetas from 1.82 billion pesetas, greatly enhancing the group's ability to make investments, <LOCATION>Zeta</LOCATION> officials said.
Following its failure last month to win a license for one of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s first three private television stations, <ORGANIZATION>Zeta</ORGANIZATION> is seeking investment opportunities in communications and publishing. 
With annual sales of about 30 billion pesetas, <ORGANIZATION>Zeta</ORGANIZATION> publishes over a dozen magazines, including the popular Tiempo, <ORGANIZATION>Interviu</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Panorama</LOCATION>, and three regional dailies.
Chairman <PERSON>Antonio Asensio</PERSON> will retain a 70% share in <LOCATION>Zeta</LOCATION>. 
The purchase strengthens <PERSON>San Jose</PERSON>, Calif.-based <LOCATION>Businessland</LOCATION>'s links to the large corporations who are among the biggest buyers of computers.
<ORGANIZATION>Data Systems</ORGANIZATION> has five retail stores in the northeast, but specializes in selling personal computers made by <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Apple Computer Inc.</ORGANIZATION> to banks, brokerage firms and other big businesses based in the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> metropolitan area. 
<PERSON>John Fitzsimmons</PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Data Systems</ORGANIZATION>, said the company was profitable and expected sales of nearly $100 million this year.
He said <LOCATION>Businessland</LOCATION>, which operates stores in 50 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> metropolitan areas, planned to absorb his firm's operations. 
<ORGANIZATION>StatesWest Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, said it sent a more detailed merger proposal to much-larger <ORGANIZATION>Mesa Airlines</ORGANIZATION>. 
<LOCATION>Farmington</LOCATION>, N.M.-based <ORGANIZATION>Mesa</ORGANIZATION> has consistently rejected StatesWest's offers, and early this week said its board wouldn't give the proposal further consideration, calling it "vague and ill-defined" because it didn't describe the source of funds or the specific terms of <ORGANIZATION>StatesWest</ORGANIZATION> securities which were part of the offer. 
The new letter purports to do this, saying that in addition to $7 a share in cash, <ORGANIZATION>StatesWest</ORGANIZATION> would offer one share of new 6% convertible preferred stock of <ORGANIZATION>StatesWest</ORGANIZATION> it values at $3 a share.
It also said the cash portion of the transaction would be financed with <ORGANIZATION>StatesWest</ORGANIZATION>'s own cash and short-term investments, plus debt and other financing arranged through <ORGANIZATION>Hibbard Brown & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the company's investment banker. 
<ORGANIZATION>StatesWest</ORGANIZATION> asked <ORGANIZATION>Mesa</ORGANIZATION> to repond by Oct. 31.
<ORGANIZATION>Mesa</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Larry Risley</PERSON> said his board had received <ORGANIZATION>Stateswest</ORGANIZATION>'s most recent offer and was reviewing it. 
GORBACHEV SAID <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> won't intervene in <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> bloc moves to democracy. 
The <LOCATION>Kremlin</LOCATION> leader, on the first day of a three-day official visit to <LOCATION>Helsinki</LOCATION>, assured <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION>'s president that the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> has "no moral or political right" to interfere with moves toward democracy in <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> or elsewhere in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>.
In <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, the Soviet <ORGANIZATION>State Bank</ORGANIZATION> announced a 90% devaluation of the ruble against the dollar for private transactions, in an apparent attempt to curb a black market for hard currency.
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> passed a bill requiring girls to get parental consent for an abortion and <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> cleared a measure banning abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy. 
The <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> is expected to approve today a program granting access free of charge to the drug <ORGANIZATION>AZT</ORGANIZATION> for children with AIDS. Adults have had access to the only approved antiviral drug since 1987.
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> sent to <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> a $2.85 billion emergency package to assist in the recovery from last week's <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> earthquake and from Hurricane Hugo.
<ORGANIZATION>House-Senate</ORGANIZATION> conferees agreed to continue production of <ORGANIZATION>Grumman Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's F-14 jet and to provide more than $3.8 billion during the current fiscal year to develop a space-based anti-missile system.
The <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> chief, facing what is viewed as the nation's worst unrest in nearly 40 years, also said he would allow East Germans to travel abroad more freely, but made clear that the <LOCATION>Berlin Wall</LOCATION> would remain. 
The move by the coalition of political parties and <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>'s largest Christian militia isolated military chief <PERSON>Aoun</PERSON>, who has rejected the plan, which includes political changes and a <LOCATION>Syrian</LOCATION> troop withdrawal from <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION>. 
But the secretary of state advised <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> that attempting to overhaul the five-point plan risked delaying the negotiations aimed at <LOCATION>Mideast</LOCATION> peace. 
<ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> defense ministers said the 16-nation alliance continues to need a strong nuclear strategy despite political changes in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>.
The ministers, concluding a two-day meeting in southern <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, welcomed <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>'s pledges to cut its military forces, but urged the Soviets to do more to slash short-range nuclear weapons. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> indicated a possible challenge to a court order allowing former <ORGANIZATION>National Security</ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON>Poindexter</PERSON> to subpoena ex-President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s personal papers for use in the defense case against <ORGANIZATION>Iran-Contra</ORGANIZATION> charges.
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> would continue a trade embargo against <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>, declaring that the Central American country poses "an unusual and extraordinary threat" to the security of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Meanwhile, Secretary of <ORGANIZATION>State Baker</ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> protested to <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> over shipments of <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> bloc arms to <LOCATION>Salvadoran</LOCATION> rebels from <LOCATION>Managua</LOCATION>. 
A landslide engulfed a hillside slum in <LOCATION>Sao Paulo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, and at least 20 people, most of them children, were missing and feared dead.
<LOCATION>Czechoslovakia</LOCATION>'s premier said he supports broad political and economic restructuring, but ruled out any dialogue between <LOCATION>Prague</LOCATION>'s Communist government and independent human-rights or dissident groups.
<PERSON>Ladislav Adamec</PERSON>, ending a two-day visit to <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>, pledged changes in <LOCATION>Czechoslovakia</LOCATION>, including freer travel to the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>.

<ORGANIZATION>Allied-Signal Aerospace Co.</ORGANIZATION> received a $65 million contract to outfit <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION>' 393 planes with the <ORGANIZATION>Bendix/King Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Allied-Signal</ORGANIZATION> is a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Allied-Signal Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a manufacturer with interests in aerospace, automotive products and engineered materials.
<ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION> is a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>. 
The <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION>Ferruzzi Agricola Finanziaria</ORGANIZATION> also disclosed a 40% rise in its consolidated net profit for the first half of 1989, excluding nonrecurring items and after payments to minority interests. 
This will include the sale of its interest in the joint venture <ORGANIZATION>Beghin Corbehem</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Feldemuehle AG</ORGANIZATION>.
And in a separate transaction, <ORGANIZATION>Beghin-Say</ORGANIZATION> will sell its remaining 25% interest in <ORGANIZATION>A.T.B.</ORGANIZATION>, a holding company for international trading assets, to an unspecified unit of <ORGANIZATION>Ferruzzi</ORGANIZATION> for 258 million francs. 
The loss stems from $357.5 million of write-downs on <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s $4.4 billion high-yield investment securities portfolio, which includes about $3.7 billion of junk bonds, $400 million of preferred stock, and <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> securities. 
<ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> owes its spectacular growth in recent years to its junk-bond portfolio, the largest of any <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> thrift.
Much of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s junk-bond trading has been done through the high-yield department of its <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION> neighbor, <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Thomas Spiegel</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, said in a statement that the thrift was "disappointed" by the effects of the accounting changes.

In composite trading yesterday on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Comprehensive Care</ORGANIZATION> shares plunged $3.625 to close at $4.75 on volume of 1,177,000 shares. 
<ORGANIZATION>Comprehensive Care</ORGANIZATION> shareholders have approved acquisition of the developer and operator of <ORGANIZATION>Care-Unit</ORGANIZATION> chemical dependency and psychiatric programs for about $58 million in cash, notes and stock of <ORGANIZATION>First Hospital</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Comprehensive Care</ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION>First Hospital</ORGANIZATION> had advised it that both bank debt and senior notes would be repaid after the acquisition, although it isn't assured the acquisition will be completed.
<ORGANIZATION>First Hospital</ORGANIZATION> advised <ORGANIZATION>Comprehensive Care</ORGANIZATION> that an agent for the financial institutions providing financing of its acquisition is scheduled to make a final credit determination tomorrow, and that a favorable determination could result in a reorganization at <ORGANIZATION>Comprehensive Care</ORGANIZATION> "by the end of October." Failure to win such a determination, however, would lead <ORGANIZATION>Comprehensive Care</ORGANIZATION> directors to "consider various alternatives," <ORGANIZATION>Comprehensive Care</ORGANIZATION> said, without elaborating. 
The <LOCATION>Oneida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, maker of consumer, food-service and industrial products also declared a quarterly cash dividend of 12 cents a share, with the same payable and record dates.
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Oneida</ORGANIZATION>'s shares closed at $18.375 a share, unchanged. 
<ORGANIZATION>Genentech</ORGANIZATION> stock fell 12.5 cents in trading yesterday on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> to $20.125. 
"We continue to be on target for . . . increasing �<ORGANIZATION>TPA</ORGANIZATION>� sales 20% to 25% this year," said founder and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON>Robert Swanson</PERSON>.
But I still think the fundamentals are poor," said <PERSON>Denise Gilbert</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Montgomery Securities</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. 
And <ORGANIZATION>Genentech</ORGANIZATION> isn't likely to have any new products ready for market until at least 1992, <PERSON>Ms. Gilbert</PERSON> added. "The company's stock is trading at 40 times next year's numbers, and that's too much," she said. 
<PERSON>Mr. Lortie</PERSON> joined <ORGANIZATION>Provigo</ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and spearheaded the company's drive to grow outside its traditional food business.
"I think it's a pretty positive development," said <PERSON>Ross Cowan</PERSON>, a financial analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, of the decision to concentrate on groceries.
<PERSON>Mr. Lortie</PERSON>'s departure, while sudden, was seen as inevitable in light of the shift in strategy. "The non-food operations were largely <PERSON>Mr. Lortie</PERSON>'s creation {and} his strategy didn't work," said <PERSON>Steven Holt</PERSON>, a financial analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Midland Doherty Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 
<LOCATION>Provigo</LOCATION>'s profit record over the past two years tarnished the company's and <PERSON>Mr. Lortie</PERSON>'s reputations.
Last month, <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Bond Rating Service</ORGANIZATION> downgraded <ORGANIZATION>Provigo</ORGANIZATION>'s commercial paper and debentures because of its lackluster performance. 
He declined to confirm or deny reports that <ORGANIZATION>Provigo</ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON>Henri Roy</PERSON> is trying to put together a management buy-out of the catalogue showroom unit.
<PERSON>Yvon Bussieres</PERSON> was named senior executive vice president and chief operating officer of <LOCATION>Provigo</LOCATION>, a new position.
<PERSON>Mr. Bussieres</PERSON> was president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION>Provigo's Quebec</ORGANIZATION> retail and wholesale grocery unit.
<PERSON>Mr. Nadeau</PERSON> said he intends to remain <ORGANIZATION>Provigo</ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive only until the non-food businesses are sold, after a which a new chief executive will be named. 
<ORGANIZATION>Consolidated Freightways Inc.</ORGANIZATION> reported a 77% drop in third-quarter net income, citing expected losses in its <ORGANIZATION>Emery Worldwide</ORGANIZATION> shipping business. 
The <LOCATION>Menlo Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, company said net was $7.4 million, or 22 cents a share, down from $32.3 million, or 86 cents a share, a year ago.
Analysts had expected Consolidated to post a slim profit, and the company's stock was down only 25 cents to $30.25 in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday. "They have to continue to tighten their belts," said <PERSON>Craig Kloner</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>McCaw Cellular Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION> must extend its offer for <ORGANIZATION>LIN Broadcasting Corp.</ORGANIZATION> because it has "not yet announced committed financing sufficient to complete" the bid, <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
According to <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> rules, <ORGANIZATION>McCaw</ORGANIZATION> is required to keep its offer for the cellular-phone and broadcasting concern open for at least five business days after the announcement of the financing, <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> said.
Last week, <PERSON>McCaw</PERSON> said it obtained "firm" financing commitments from three major banks in regard to its bid to control <ORGANIZATION>LIN Broadcasting</ORGANIZATION>.
A spokesman for <PERSON>McCaw</PERSON> said the company was "moving forward with our financing." He added that "hopefully <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> will conduct a fair auction." 
McCaw wants to buy 22 million shares of <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> for $125 each, or $2.75 billion, which would result in McCaw's owning 50.3% of <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION>.
The offer is in limbo, however, because <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> has agreed to merge its cellular-phone businesses with <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
Comments by <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Board</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Alan Greenspan</PERSON> lent some support to the dollar, but the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unit ended yesterday lower against most major currencies. 
Testifying before a panel of the <ORGANIZATION>House Banking Committee</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Greenspan</PERSON> said the short-term value of the dollar on foreign-exchange markets isn't the primary policy focus of the central bank. 
In perhaps his most telling remark, <PERSON>Mr. Greenspan</PERSON> termed the current <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> inflation rate of around 4.5% as "much too high to be ignored." 
The dollar climbed immediately higher on news of <PERSON>Mr. Greenspan</PERSON>'s testimony, settling lower in later trade as dealers squared positions ahead of today's preliminary report on third-quarter <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> gross national product. 
In <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Thursday, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> currency opened for trading at 141.60 yen, up from Wednesday's <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> close of 141.55 yen. 
But according to <PERSON>Doug Madison</PERSON>, a corporate trader with <ORGANIZATION>Bank of America</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, a large number of short positions must first be corrected, spurring a temporary upswing, before the unit can turn lower. 
Market participants hope today's <ORGANIZATION>GNP</ORGANIZATION> report will offer more substantial evidence on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economic growth, although analysts are quick to point out that the figures may overstate the economy's vigor. 
On the <ORGANIZATION>Commodity Exchange</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, gold for current delivery settled at $369.10 an ounce, down $1.10.
<ORGANIZATION>Amoco Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it plans to install two platforms and drill as many as 22 wells to develop oil reserves it discovered in the <LOCATION>Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION> about 25 miles off the coast of <LOCATION>Congo</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Amoco</ORGANIZATION>, an energy concern, is the operator of the project with a 43.75% working interest, and other partners include <PERSON>Hydro Congo</PERSON>, the Congolese state oil company, with a 50% interest, and <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Petroleum Exploration Co.</ORGANIZATION> with a 6.25% stake.
Over the past nine months, several firms, including discount broker <ORGANIZATION>Charles Schwab & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sears, Roebuck & Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</ORGANIZATION> unit, have attacked program trading as a major market evil. 
On Tuesday afternoon, <PERSON>Kemper</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>Bear, Stearns & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Kidder, Peabody & Co.</ORGANIZATION> unit, <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley and Oppenheimer & Co.</ORGANIZATION> that it will no longer do business with them because of their commitment to index arbitrage, officials inside and outside these firms confirmed.
"We've been opposed to" index arbitrage "for a long time," said <PERSON>Stephen B. Timbers</PERSON>, chief investment officer at <ORGANIZATION>Kemper</ORGANIZATION>, which manages $56 billion, including $8 billion of stocks. "Index arbitrage doesn't work, and it scares natural buyers" of stock. 
<PERSON>Kemper</PERSON> also blasted the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> for ignoring the interests of individual and institutional holders. "The <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> has vested interests" in its big member securities firms "that cloud its objectivity," <PERSON>Mr. Timbers</PERSON> said. "It has never been interested in what we think.
Small investors perceive that "big operators" dominate the market, said <PERSON>Thomas O'Hara</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Investors</ORGANIZATION> and head of the exchange's <ORGANIZATION>Individual Investors Advisory Committee</ORGANIZATION> set up after the 1987 crash. "The impression I've got is they'd love to do away with it {program trading}, but they {the exchange} can't do it," he said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>John J. Phelan</PERSON> said in a recent interview that he has no inclination to eliminate program trading.
<ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Kidder Peabody</ORGANIZATION>, the two biggest program trading firms, staunchly defend their strategies. "We continue to believe the position we've taken is reasonable," a <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley</ORGANIZATION> official said. "We would stop index arbitrage when the market is under stress, and we have recently," he said, citing Oct. 13 and earlier this week.
<PERSON>Michael Carpenter</PERSON>, president and chief executive officer at <ORGANIZATION>Kidder Peabody</ORGANIZATION>, said in a recent interview, "We don't think that index arbitrage has a negative impact on the market as a whole." 
According to <PERSON>Lawrence Eckenfelder</PERSON>, a securities industry analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, "<PERSON>Kemper</PERSON> is the first firm to make a major statement with program trading." He added that "having just one firm do this isn't going to mean a hill of beans.
<ORGANIZATION>American Medical International Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it hasn't received any other offers to acquire the owner and operator of hospitals, and took another step toward completion of its $3 billion acquisition by <ORGANIZATION>IMA Holdings Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
Earlier this month <ORGANIZATION>IMA</ORGANIZATION>, an investment group that includes <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Pritzker</PERSON> family and <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, submitted a reduced bid for American Medical after it couldn't finance its initial offer.
Yesterday, in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>AMI</ORGANIZATION> common closed at $23.625, up 12.5 cents, on volume of almost 1.8 million. 
<ORGANIZATION>American Medical</ORGANIZATION> said its directors have approved what is, in effect, a draft of a solvency opinion on the acquisition, submitted by the Los Angeles-based investment banking and evaluation consulting firm of <ORGANIZATION>Houlian Lokey Howard & Zukin Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
Separately, <ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION> downgraded the ratings of <ORGANIZATION>American Medical</ORGANIZATION>'s senior and subordinated debt issues and those of its international affiliate.
The downgrade anticipates completion of the <ORGANIZATION>IMA Holdings</ORGANIZATION> acquisition today, <ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION>'s said. 
An <ORGANIZATION>American Medical</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said the <ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION>'s downgrading was expected because of the nature of the takeover. 
Many analysts said they weren't surprised that problems in many of Ryder's lines of business continued to plague the company. "It pretty much confirms what we had been expecting," said <PERSON>Anthony Hatch</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>M. Anthony Burns</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ryder</PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive officer, said: "We're constantly trying to find ways to regain the earnings momentum.
<PERSON>Richard D. Sutton</PERSON>, 64 years old, chairman of this bank-holding company, was named acting president and chief executive officer of the company and its <ORGANIZATION>First National Bank of Toms River</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary.
<PERSON>Mr. Robertson</PERSON> was also removed from the board of <ORGANIZATION>First National Bank of New Jersey-Salem County</ORGANIZATION>, another unit, and the <LOCATION>Toms River</LOCATION> bank. 
"New technologies are changing the way we deal with each other and the way we work," says <PERSON>Janlori Goldman</PERSON>, a staff attorney at the <ORGANIZATION>American Civil Liberties Union</ORGANIZATION>. "Our expectation of confidentiality is being eroded." 
Among companies saying they monitor employees are <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>United Parcel Service</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Nynex Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Spiegel Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION>circulation department</ORGANIZATION> of this newspaper.
Businesses "want to verify information and ensure accuracy," says <PERSON>John Hiltunen</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dictaphone</PERSON>'s manager of media relations.
The state of <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> recently bought the <ORGANIZATION>Veritrac</ORGANIZATION> system, he says, "to monitor the Exxon cleanup effort." 
<ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ORGANIZATION> say they use voice-activated systems to record and verify orders between salesmen and traders.
The Counter Spy Shop in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, for instance, offers the "Secret Connection" attache case, which can surreptitiously record conversations for nine hours at a stretch.
And four states -- <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> -- have adopted rules that all parties involved must consent when phone calls are recorded. 
<LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>) introduced congressional legislation that would require an audible beeping during any employee monitoring, warning people that they are being heard. (The legislation is similar to a 1987 "beeper bill" that was defeated after heavy lobbying by the telemarketing industry.) Also last spring, Rep. <PERSON>Ron Dellums</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>), introduced a bill requiring universal two-party consent to any tapings in cases that don't involve law enforcement.
"I'm sympathetic with workers who feel under the gun," says <PERSON>Richard Barton</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Direct Marketing Association of America</ORGANIZATION>, which is lobbying strenuously against the Edwards beeper bill. "But the only way you can find out how your people are doing is by listening." The powerful group, which represents many of the nation's telemarketers, was instrumental in derailing the 1987 bill. 
<PERSON>Laura Dale</PERSON>, center manager at the catalog company's customer order center in <LOCATION>Reno</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>, defends monitoring. "We like to follow up and make sure operators are achieving our standards of company service," says <PERSON>Ms. Dale</PERSON>, who supervises 350 operators. 
<PERSON>John Bonomo</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Nynex</ORGANIZATION> spokesman, says the telephone company needs to monitor operators to evaluate performance during the first six months on the job. "Sometimes," he says, "we'll pull someone off the phones for more training." 
<ORGANIZATION>Radio Shack</ORGANIZATION> says it has a policy against selling products if a salesperson suspects they will be used illegally. "Everything sold at <ORGANIZATION>Radio Shack</ORGANIZATION> has a legal purpose," says <PERSON>Bernard Appel</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Tandy Corp.</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary.
The <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> gave provisional six-month approval to the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> basket at a meeting late yesterday.
The <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> at the same time approved a similar but smaller basket product on the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Board Options Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, where the minimum will be $1.7 million.
The basket products are "an evolutionary step" in solving problems in trading big blocks of stock that came to light in the 1987 market crash, said <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON>Joseph Grundfest</PERSON>. 
New <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Richard Breeden</PERSON>, overseeing his first public meeting, said there have been concerns that the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s basket could attract investors with a "short-term perspective" who would rapidly turn over the product, thus increasing volatility. 
But <PERSON>Richard Ketchum</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>'s market regulation chief, said he didn't believe "this will spawn dramatic new program-trading strategies that will be destabilizing." 
The baskets on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>CBOE</ORGANIZATION> -- which involve the actual <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> stocks, unlike the stock-index contracts currently traded on the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> futures markets, and index options on the <ORGANIZATION>CBOE</ORGANIZATION> -- will begin trading as critics step up their attacks on program trading and its contributions to the stock market's wild price swings. 
ESPs are also an attempt by the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> to head off the exodus of program trading business to overseas markets such as <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
Already, many of the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s own floor traders are warning that the <ORGANIZATION>ESP</ORGANIZATION> baskets are risky and not in the best interests of the investing public.
"The <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> is losing its cool here," said <PERSON>James Andrews</PERSON>, head of institutional trading at <ORGANIZATION>Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>.
Both the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board's Exchange Stock Portfolio</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> exchange's Market Basket are designed for institutional investors.
The market makers so far are <ORGANIZATION>CS First Boston Group's First Boston Corp.</ORGANIZATION> unit, <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc.</ORGANIZATION> unit. 
<ORGANIZATION>Kidder, Peabody & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> unit that has become the biggest program trader along with <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley</ORGANIZATION>, isn't a market maker, although the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> hopes that will change.
Similarly, the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> hopes to entice <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co</ORGANIZATION>. Neither has plans to be a market maker for now. 
The <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Breeden</PERSON> said the after-hours trading on the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> exchange would help the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> win back business that has moved overseas to conduct after-hours trades. 
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>, which made the announcement at the dedication of a research center here, said it invited many other companies to participate as well, including some from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Jack Kuehler</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>'s president, said <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> is also considering letting other companies participate in additional semiconductor work but declined to be more specific. 
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>, which said a year ago it was inviting companies to participate in some semiconductor work, has become far more open about its technology as it has tried to rally <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> industry to head off the Japanese, who now dominate the market for dynamic random access memory chips. 
While <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Armonk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, makes the bulk of the DRAMs it uses, it doesn't make the equipment needed to produce those chips.
And <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> worries that the Japanese will take over that equipment market, too, unless <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> semiconductor companies produce enough memory chips here to keep <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> equipment makers healthy.
Failure of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> equipment makers, <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> fears, would leave it dependent on many of the Japanese companies that compete with it in other parts of the market. 
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> also said it expects to benefit from the expertise that <ORGANIZATION>Motorola</ORGANIZATION> and other companies can bring to bear on the difficult problems involved in semiconductor manufacturing.
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>, which said <ORGANIZATION>Motorola</ORGANIZATION> is paying just a nominal fee to cover the 21-month agreement, acknowledged some companies had turned down its invitation to join in.
<ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Breeden</PERSON> said he would consider imposing "circuit breakers" to halt program trading during sharp swings in the market. 
<ORGANIZATION>Kemper Financial Services</ORGANIZATION> has stopped executing its stock trades through four big securities firms because of their involvement in program trading, which <PERSON>Kemper</PERSON> and others say is ruining the market. 
Also, <ORGANIZATION>Armco</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>National Intergroup</ORGANIZATION> had lower operating profit in steel, marking what may be the end of a two-year industry boom. 
<ORGANIZATION>Columbia S&L</ORGANIZATION> posted a quarterly loss of $226.3 million as the <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION> thrift reeled from new industry rules and turmoil in junk bonds. 
<ORGANIZATION>PS New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION> received a sweetened bid from another suitor, <ORGANIZATION>United Illuminating</ORGANIZATION>, which valued its new proposal at $2.29 billion, apparently topping all others so far. 
<ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Greenspan</PERSON> said the central bank can wipe out inflation without causing a recession, but doing so will inflict short-term pain. 
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Hughes Electronics</ORGANIZATION> unit said profit slid 22% in the third quarter.
The finance unit, <ORGANIZATION>GMAC</ORGANIZATION>, said net fell 3.1%, but <ORGANIZATION>EDS</ORGANIZATION>'s profit rose 16%. 
Campeau reportedly may receive a $1.3 billion offer for <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale</ORGANIZATION>'s from <ORGANIZATION>Tokyu Department Store of Japan</ORGANIZATION>.
Some major <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade partners quickly rejected a compromise proposal by <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to liberalize trade and reduce farm-product subsidies. 
<ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the parent of the auction house <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's</ORGANIZATION>, said its net loss for the seasonally slow third quarter narrowed from a year earlier on a leap in operating revenue. 
The products are aimed at a market expected to total more than $1 billion a year in sales by 1995, said <PERSON>Morgan Buchner Jr.</PERSON>, vice president of transmission systems for <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> said the products, unlike previous generations, will meet so-called Sonet compatability standards, which <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> expects to be broadly adopted.
<ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> said it expects to beat to the marketplace two rivals, <ORGANIZATION>Northern Telecom Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Alcatel N.V.</ORGANIZATION>, which also have announced Sonet-based products. 
It noted that last July, <ORGANIZATION>Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> selected <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> to supply $154 million of such equipment over a four-year period starting next year. 
<PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>, who was practicing the read-my-lips school of politics years before <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> encountered it, has made clear her opposition to refashioning <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s free-market policies to suit the bureaucrats in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>.
In return, <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> is excoriated from <ORGANIZATION>Fleet Street</ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> as an obstructionist. 
Well, it now turns out that <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> had to travel across the globe to the 49-member <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION>Kuala Lumpur</LOCATION> to discomfit the Holy Order of Consensus Builders. 
"A disastrous farce in <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>," screamed the Manchester Guardian. "She can no longer be trusted to behave in a civilised -- that is unflaky -- fashion when abroad." <LOCATION>Egad</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Brian Mulroney</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Bob Hawke</PERSON>, the paper said, were "enraged." The <ORGANIZATION>London Times</ORGANIZATION> said she had "contravened protocol." 
She issued a separate statement, separating herself from a <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> document reasserting the political value of imposing sanctions against <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON>Mahathir Mohamad</PERSON> sniffed, "If everybody else puts out their left foot and you put out your right foot, you are out of step." <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>: "If it's one against 48, I'm very sorry for the 48." 
If indeed <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> has one opponent that could throw her off political course it is <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s mysteriously intractable inflation problem.
Perhaps <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> understands better than those distressed at her style that ultimately history and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s voters will decide who is right about <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, sanctioning <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> or running <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s economy. 
<PERSON>Robert L. Wood</PERSON>, 37-year-old chief financial officer, was named chairman and chief executive officer of this independent power producer, succeeding <PERSON>Raymond L. Hixson</PERSON>, 63.
<ORGANIZATION>Esselte AB</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION> office supplies company, as expected, proposed to acquire the 22% it doesn't own of its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unit, <ORGANIZATION>Esselte Business Systems Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>Esselte</ORGANIZATION> closed yesterday at $43.50 a share, up $1. 
A committee of outside directors for the <LOCATION>Garden City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, unit is evaluating the proposal; the parent asked it to respond by Oct. 31.
<ORGANIZATION>Advanced Medical Technologies Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it purchased 93% of a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Henley Group Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Advanced Medical</ORGANIZATION> paid $106 million in cash for its share in a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Henley</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Fisher Scientific</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary.
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Memories Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the venture that seeks to crack <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s domination of the memory-chip market, said it has chosen four potential sites for its operations after a fierce bidding war by 15 states. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Memories said it will begin visits during the next several weeks to sites in <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Colorado Springs</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Middletown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>; and <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> and several other <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> cities mounted major campaigns during the summer to woo the group, which was founded last June by seven electronics concerns. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Memories investors include <ORGANIZATION>Advanced Micro Devices Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Intel Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>LSI Logic Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>National Semiconductor Corp</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Kane</PERSON> said he expects several other companies to join some time after the venture completes a business plan, probably later this week. 
<PERSON>Donald DeScenza</PERSON>, an independent analyst in <LOCATION>New Canaan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, said he was "impressed with the company's performance." He said results were better than he'd expected and indicate that <ORGANIZATION>Goodyear</ORGANIZATION> is in the midst of a turnaround from a string of lackluster quarters that have plagued the company for a year. 
However, <PERSON>Harry Millis</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>McDonald & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>Goodyear</ORGANIZATION>'s results "fell at the bottom" of his range of estimates.
<ORGANIZATION>Goodyear</ORGANIZATION>'s stock, which has been weak in recent weeks, fell $2.875 yesterday to close at $43.875 a share in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 
McDonald's <PERSON>Mr. Millis</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Goodyear</ORGANIZATION> appeared to have held or gained some market share in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> for the first time since the second quarter of 1988. 
But <ORGANIZATION>Goodyear</ORGANIZATION> said total <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> tire unit sales were off about 2%.
<ORGANIZATION>Delmed Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's top two officers resigned and were succeeded by executives of <ORGANIZATION>Fresenius USA Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and its parent, <ORGANIZATION>Fresenius AG</ORGANIZATION>, a major <ORGANIZATION>Delmed</ORGANIZATION> holder that has been negotiating to acquire a controlling stake. 
In addition, <ORGANIZATION>Delmed</ORGANIZATION>, which makes and sells a dialysis solution used in treating kidney diseases, said negotiations about pricing had collapsed between it and a major distributor, <ORGANIZATION>National Medical Care Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Delmed</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Robert S. Ehrlich</PERSON> resigned as chairman, president and chief executive.
<PERSON>Mr. Ehrlich</PERSON> was succeeded as chairman by <PERSON>Gerd Krick</PERSON>, a director of Fresenius, a West German pharmaceutical concern.
<PERSON>Ben Lipps</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Fresenius USA</ORGANIZATION>, was named president, chief executive and chief operating officer. 
In trading on the <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Delmed</ORGANIZATION> closed at 50 cents, down 6.25 cents. 
The two companies have been discussing a transaction under which Fresenius would buy <ORGANIZATION>Delmed</ORGANIZATION> stock for cash to bring its beneficial ownership to between 70% and 80% of <ORGANIZATION>Delmed</ORGANIZATION>'s fully diluted common stock.
Yesterday, <PERSON>Delmed</PERSON> said it "continues to explore the possibility of a combination with <LOCATION>Fresenius USA</LOCATION>." It added that it is apparent that any terms of a combination "would be substantially less favorable than those previously announced." 
While the discussions between <LOCATION>Delmed</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>National Medical Care</ORGANIZATION> have been discontinued, <PERSON>Delmed</PERSON> will continue to supply dialysis products through <ORGANIZATION>National Medical</ORGANIZATION> after their exclusive agreement ends in March 1990, <PERSON>Delmed</PERSON> said.
In addition, <PERSON>Delmed</PERSON> is exploring distribution arrangements with <ORGANIZATION>Fresenius USA</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Delmed</PERSON> said. 
French chemicals group, <ORGANIZATION>Orkem S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday it has made a bid for control of <ORGANIZATION>Coates Brothers PLC</ORGANIZATION>, a British manufacturer of inks and polyester resins. 
State-controlled <ORGANIZATION>Orkem</ORGANIZATION> already owns 40.6% of <ORGANIZATION>Coates</ORGANIZATION>.
The <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, thrift said the restructuring should help it meet new capital standards from the <ORGANIZATION>Financial Institution Reform</ORGANIZATION>, Recovery and Enforcement Act.
The <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> company said major rivals, <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Miller Brewing</ORGANIZATION> unit and <ORGANIZATION>Adolph Coors Co.</ORGANIZATION> "have been following a policy of continuous and deep discounting for at least the past 18 months" on their premium brands, pricing their product as much as 25 cents a 12-pack below Anheuser's Budweiser label in many markets.
<PERSON>Anheuser</PERSON> said it continues to hold to its earlier-announced goal of a 50% <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market share by the mid-1990s. 
Beneath the tepid news-release jargon lies a powerful threat from the brewing giant, which last year accounted for about 41% of all <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> beer sales and is expected to see that grow to 42.5% in the current year. "Anheuser is the biggest guy in the bar, and he just decided to join in the barroom brawl," said <PERSON>Joseph J. Doyle</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.</ORGANIZATION> "It's going to get bloody." 
<PERSON>Jerry Steinman</PERSON>, publisher of Beer Marketers Insights, a trade newsletter, said <PERSON>Anheuser</PERSON>'s announcement means "everybody else in the industry is going to have a difficult time reaching their profit objectives." 
<ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON>George E. Thompson</PERSON> downplayed the importance of the announcement, and called any comparison between the coming beer-industry tiff and the seemingly unending "cola wars," unwarranted.
<PERSON>Mr. Thompson</PERSON> calls discounting "a loser's game for anyone without a dominant market share," and projected that <PERSON>Anheuser</PERSON>'s statement of intent could simply be a means of warning competitors to ease up on price-cutting or face a costly and fruitless battle. 
But <ORGANIZATION>Smith Barney</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Doyle</PERSON>, who yesterday trimmed his 1990 Anheuser earnings projection to $2.95 a share from $3.10, called the market's reaction "justified." While the third-quarter earnings were a "moderate disappointment," he said, "the real bad news is the intensity of price competition" in the premium-beer sector. 
According to <PERSON>Mr. Steinman</PERSON>, the newsletter publisher, <PERSON>Anheuser</PERSON>'s market share is nearly twice that of its nearest competitor, <ORGANIZATION>Miller Brewing</ORGANIZATION>, which had a 21.2% stake last year.
It's followed by <ORGANIZATION>Stroh Brewery Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which has agreed to sell its assets to <ORGANIZATION>Coors</ORGANIZATION>.
Both <ORGANIZATION>Coors</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Stroh</PERSON> have recently been ceding market share to <ORGANIZATION>Miller</ORGANIZATION> and Anheuser. 
Italian car manufacturer <ORGANIZATION>Fiat</ORGANIZATION> said it isn't interested in partnership or industrial cooperation with Swedish auto and aerospace group <ORGANIZATION>Saab-Scania AB</ORGANIZATION>, which faces heavy losses in its car division. 
<ORGANIZATION>Fiat</ORGANIZATION> said it's only interested in technical cooperation with <PERSON>Saab</PERSON>. 
"We know that <LOCATION>Saab</LOCATION> is looking for a partner for industrial and financial cooperation," <PERSON>Fiat</PERSON> said. "But that partner isn't Fiat." 
The Italian auto maker confirmed that it was discussing technical cooperation with <PERSON>Saab</PERSON>, but declined to comment on rumors that it was planning to buy <ORGANIZATION>Saab</ORGANIZATION>'s car division. 
Fiat's rejection of partnership with <LOCATION>Saab</LOCATION> means that the <LOCATION>Swedish</LOCATION> company, which announced last Friday that its pretax profit for the first eight months plummeted 49%, will have to look for a partner among other car manufacturers as both <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and Fiat have turned down the offer. 
News reports said yesterday that <LOCATION>Saab</LOCATION> is trying to start negotiations with <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> automakers <PERSON>Peugeot</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Renault</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> awarded <ORGANIZATION>Litton Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Ingalls Shipbuilding</ORGANIZATION> division $15.5 million for shipyard services on the Aegis cruiser program.
<ORGANIZATION>Amdahl Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a maker of mainframe computers, reported a sharp decline in net income for its third quarter, citing pricecutting by competitors and adverse effects from a strong <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollar. 
<PERSON>Jay Stevens</PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON>Dean Witter Reynolds</PERSON>, said he expected the <LOCATION>Sunnyvale</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, company to earn 35 cents a share for the quarter and said the firm's weaker profit was partly the result of increased competition from <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Amdahl</ORGANIZATION>'s principal competitor for mainframe sales. 
But while the Composite gained 1.19, to 462.89, many issues didn't participate in the advance. "It was a mixed bag," said <PERSON>Richard Bruno</PERSON>, who heads over-the-counter trading at <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION>. "We played catch-up in some areas, and sold off in some others." 
<PERSON>Lance Zipper</PERSON>, head of over-the-counter trading at <ORGANIZATION>Kidder Peabody</ORGANIZATION>, said it is difficult to make predictions based on yesterday's trading volume.
The president of <PERSON>Herzog</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Heine</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Geduld</PERSON> expects the market to be "very choppy" for a while. "There's a lot of uncertainty out there, and it will cause a lot of swings," he said. 
Among active stocks, <ORGANIZATION>MCI Communications</ORGANIZATION> rose 7/8 to 43 on 2.2 million shares, <ORGANIZATION>Mentor Graphics</ORGANIZATION> added 1/8 to 16 3/8 on turnover of 1.5 million shares.
<ORGANIZATION>Amgen</ORGANIZATION> advanced 1 1/2 to 56; <LOCATION>Chiron</LOCATION> jumped 2 to 29 3/4; <ORGANIZATION>Cetus</ORGANIZATION> gained 1 to 16 7/8 and <ORGANIZATION>Biogen</ORGANIZATION> rose 5/8 to 14 5/8. 
In a <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> filing, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said it holds 22.8 million ordinary shares.
"The boom's so huge," says <PERSON>Mitsuru Saito</PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION>Sanwa Research Institute</ORGANIZATION>, "it makes you think of the Golden '60s," when <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> developed rapidly. 
So big is the capital-spending boom that Japanese companies' outlays in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> topped American companies' domestic outlays by $521.4 billion to $494.8 billion in the 12 months ended March 31 even though <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s total output of goods and services is less than two-thirds <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s. 
They fear that the boom may be too big for <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s or anyone else's good. "It's an explosive cocktail" thrown at the world, says <PERSON>Kenneth Courtis</PERSON>, senior economist at the <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION>Deutsche Bank Group</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>MITI</ORGANIZATION> officials hope to avoid yet-another source of trade friction with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> even though export restraints currently limit Japanese car exports to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
With <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> running enormous trade surpluses against much of the world, they think that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> should meet the increased domestic demand by importing more.
And eventually, they contend, domestic demand will weaken, forcing companies to emphasize exports again. "If there's a further drive to export," says <PERSON>Nobuyuki Arai</PERSON>, an economist at the <ORGANIZATION>Japan Development Bank</ORGANIZATION>, "that'll be a problem." 
But although Japanese companies increased their <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auto output by 42% from January to September compared with the year-earlier period, their exports to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> will drop only 9% this year, <ORGANIZATION>Nikko Research Center</ORGANIZATION> estimates. 
Many are pouring money into developing high-quality products to target affluent consumers and, to some extent, to avoid direct combat with cheaper cars from <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>.
The buildup is "making <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> clearly more efficient, more technologically advanced and more competitive," declares a Western diplomat in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Nissan Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's domestic auto sales are up 20% this year largely because its expensive <ORGANIZATION>Cima</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Sylvia</LOCATION> and Cefiro models are in heavy demand. 
"One dealer told me that if he had more cars, he'd sell them right away," says <PERSON>Takuro Endo</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> executive vice president.
The emphasis on market share is evident at <ORGANIZATION>Daikin Industries Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s biggest maker of industrial air conditioners.
Besides, <PERSON>Daikin</PERSON>'s major competitors, <ORGANIZATION>Hitachi Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, "are all adding production lines," a <LOCATION>Daikin</LOCATION> spokesman says. "Until now, we were trying to increase productivity with the facilities we already had.
<ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> aims to expand its 25% share of the market to 30% by spending $141 million on a plant in southern <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> that could make as many as 240,000 cars a year.
Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Toyota Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's $247 million buildup is increasing its annual capacity by 180,000 cars, and <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION> is spending $317 million on expansion.
Although imports account for less than 1% of beer sales in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Asahi Breweries Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, which has been gaining share with its popular dry beer, plans to fend off Japanese competitors by pouring $1.06 billion into facilities to brew 50% more beer.
The product isn't widely used yet, but <LOCATION>Toshiba</LOCATION>, which has already beaten everyone else in producing the current-generation one-megabit DRAMs, believes that its early investment will heighten its chances of beating its competitors again. "It's important to gain leadership," a <LOCATION>Toshiba</LOCATION> spokesman says. 
Meanwhile, <LOCATION>Toshiba</LOCATION>'s Japanese rivals, <PERSON>Hitachi</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Fujitsu Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NEC Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, aren't sitting still.
The new chip plants "won't be excessive investment," says <PERSON>Hajime Sasaki</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>NEC</ORGANIZATION> vice president. "We have enough products to make and the markets to sell these products." 
<ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION>'s $35,000 Lexus automobile, a luxury model that it started shipping to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> only last month, is racking up orders at a time when U.S.-made luxury-car sales are slow.
The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> called on <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to attach the proposed capital-gains tax cut to its final deficit-reduction bill, but lawmakers seem likely to balk at the idea. 
But now that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> has missed the legal deadline for meeting the Gramm-Rudman targets, the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> said it has returned to its original view that a capital-gains cut should be part of the deficit-reduction bill, on which <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> continues to work. "If that doesn't happen, then we press forward on another vehicle and a separate vote," said press secretary <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON>. 
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>William Archer</PERSON>, the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION>House Ways and Means Committee</ORGANIZATION> said, "I don't see how we have the votes" to place a capital-gains tax cut there. 
The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> said he plans to hold a series of private <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> meetings, mostly with <ORGANIZATION>Senate Democrats</ORGANIZATION>, to try to persuade lawmakers to fall in line behind the tax cut. 
According to some who attended, the senators argued that the president should give the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic</ORGANIZATION> leaders in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> a victory of their own to compensate them for allowing the president to win on the controversial capital-gains issue.
<ORGANIZATION>Quickview Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it filed a lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION>Apple Computer Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, claiming patent infringement in an element of <ORGANIZATION>Apple</ORGANIZATION>'s popular HyperCard software program. 
The <ORGANIZATION>HyperCard</ORGANIZATION> program allows users to design applications for Macintosh computers without having to be hardcore programmers and is distributed with every <ORGANIZATION>Macintosh</ORGANIZATION> sold.
The technology at issue "is not an underlying technology of <ORGANIZATION>HyperCard</ORGANIZATION> to my knowledge," said <PERSON>Danny Goodman</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>San Francisco-area</LOCATION> HyperCard program developer. 
In <LOCATION>Cupertino</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Apple</ORGANIZATION> said that it believes the case has no merit, and that <PERSON>HyperCard</PERSON> does not infringe "any valid claims" of the Quickview patents.
It said it filed an action of its own in federal court in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, seeking a declaration that <LOCATION>Quickview</LOCATION>'s claims are invalid. 
<PERSON>Fred D. Thompson</PERSON>, a 47-year-old attorney in private practice in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, was elected to the board of this engineering and construction company.
A group including <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investors <PERSON>Douglas A. Kass</PERSON> and <PERSON>Anthony Pedone</PERSON> holds the equivalent of a 12.6% stake in <ORGANIZATION>H.H. Robertson Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's common shares outstanding, according to a filing with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>. 
As reported last month, <PERSON>Mr. Kass</PERSON> said he was interested in making an offer to buy <ORGANIZATION>H.H. Robertson</ORGANIZATION> for $13 a share. 
In the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> filing, the <ORGANIZATION>Kass-Pedone</ORGANIZATION> group said it intends to acquire additional <PERSON>H.H. Robertson</PERSON> shares "with a view towards a possible change in control of the company." It has not, however, made a formal proposal. 
The group controls 795,900 <ORGANIZATION>H.H. Robertson</ORGANIZATION> common shares, assuming exercise of an option it acquired from <ORGANIZATION>Executive Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> to buy 497,400 shares.
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>H.H. Robertson</ORGANIZATION> closed at $11.625, up 62.5 cents. 
Former <ORGANIZATION>USX Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON>David M. Roderick</PERSON> may have been lucky he retired last May. 
<PERSON>Mr. Icahn</PERSON>, the company's deep-pocketed, tenacious adversary, recently disclosed that he had raised his <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> stake to 13.1%, and he again threatened a takeover.
The import quotas got only a 2 1/2-year extension, and <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> is laboring under a staggering $5.8 billion debt at a time when it must spend money to upgrade steel mills and drill for oil. "It's a baptism of fire for <PERSON>Corry</PERSON>," says one <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> executive. 
Or he might have to incur a huge expense of either buying <PERSON>Mr. Icahn</PERSON>'s stock, possibly at a premium, or paying stockholders a special dividend partly because of <PERSON>Mr. Icahn</PERSON>'s pressure. 
With his recent purchases of <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> common stock, <PERSON>Mr. Icahn</PERSON> shattered a three-year-old, unwritten standstill agreement with <PERSON>Mr. Roderick</PERSON>.
In 1986, <PERSON>Mr. Roderick</PERSON> adroitly dodged <PERSON>Mr. Icahn</PERSON>'s first bullet after the takeover specialist had built up an 11.4% stake.
<PERSON>Mr. Roderick</PERSON> did so by having <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> redeem a series of guaranteed notes, a move that, in effect, raised the cost of a $7.19 billion Icahn bid by about $3 billion.
Over dinners at <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Sky Club</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Links Club</ORGANIZATION> restaurants, the steel executive and the big investor talked steel, international trade and thoroughbred horses. 
<PERSON>Mr. Corry</PERSON>, who has boned up on corporate raiders by reading <PERSON>T. Boone Pickens</PERSON>'s autobiography, had hoped the detente would continue.
He was shocked, associates say, to learn of <PERSON>Mr. Icahn</PERSON>'s new takeover threat. (Both men declined to be interviewed for this article.) But the fiercely competitive <PERSON>Mr. Corry</PERSON> quickly showed he's no pushover.
Although the board believed that <PERSON>Mr. Icahn</PERSON> is more interested in talking the stock price higher than acquiring <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION>, it adopted a poison-pill defense, to be swallowed if anyone amasses a 15% stake. 
<PERSON>Mr. Icahn</PERSON> may not want to sell out unless he can get a special dividend similar to one he received before selling his stake in <ORGANIZATION>Texaco Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in June -- a coup that gave him enough cash to make his <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> move. 
And although the recent turmoil in the stock and junk-bond markets, by making it harder to arrange takeover financing, has eased some of the pressure on <PERSON>Mr. Corry</PERSON>, it doesn't end the takeover threat. "I know it's not over," a sober-faced <PERSON>Mr. Corry</PERSON> acknowledged while greeting steel suppliers in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> on Oct. 12 and inviting them to a buffet of salmon and sushi in honor of <ORGANIZATION>Kobe Steel Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION>'s partner in a steel mill in <LOCATION>Lorain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>. 
In fact, it's barely begun for <PERSON>Mr. Corry</PERSON>, who faces tough decisions before he has had a chance to get settled into his new job. "He's in a vulnerable position because he hasn't established much credibility on his own," says <PERSON>Bryan Jacoboski</PERSON>, a securities analyst at <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
An undistinguished college student who dabbled in zoology until he concluded that he couldn't stand cutting up frogs, <PERSON>Mr. Corry</PERSON> wanted to work for a big company "that could do big things." But after joining the tax department of a <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary 30 years ago, he set the modest goal of becoming tax manager by the age of 46.
Yet, the unassuming <PERSON>Mr. Corry</PERSON> helped chart <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION>'s transition from <ORGANIZATION>Big Steel</ORGANIZATION> to Big Oil.
Nevertheless, <PERSON>Mr. Corry</PERSON>, once named chief executive, didn't waste any time distancing himself from his former boss, who still has an office on the 62nd floor of the <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> tower in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>.
Soon after taking over last June, <PERSON>Mr. Corry</PERSON> rescinded a pay cut imposed on clerical workers, a move that <PERSON>Mr. Roderick</PERSON> hadn't made in spite of improved earnings.
<PERSON>Mr. Corry</PERSON> also ruled that all board meetings would be held in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> instead of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> or Findlay, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Marathon</PERSON>'s home. 
One former executive says, "Nobody wanted that deal inside <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> except <PERSON>Dave Roderick</PERSON>," who was a hunting and fishing buddy of <PERSON>William L. Hutchison</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Oil & Gas</ORGANIZATION>.
The executive recalls <PERSON>Mr. Corry</PERSON> whispering to him and others, "Remember, this was <PERSON>Dave</PERSON>'s deal." 
What miffed many <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> executives and shareholders was that the acquisition, for $3 billion of stock, doubled the <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> shares outstanding and considerably diluted them.
<PERSON>Mr. Corry</PERSON> expected the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Oil & Gas</ORGANIZATION> sale to delight <PERSON>Mr. Icahn</PERSON> by addressing his concern about boosting shareholder value.
But when the two men met in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> a day after <PERSON>Mr. Icahn</PERSON> disclosed the rise in his <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> stake, <PERSON>Mr. Corry</PERSON> learned that <PERSON>Mr. Icahn</PERSON> wanted him to sell all of <LOCATION>Texas Oil</LOCATION> -- not just its reserves of about 1.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 28 million barrels of oil but also its pipeline, gas-gathering and contract-drilling operations.
That would leave <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> with <ORGANIZATION>Marathon</ORGANIZATION>, its steel mills and its diversified business segment, which includes, among other things, mineral and transportation products. 
The problem is that <PERSON>Mr. Icahn</PERSON> is pushing him to move faster and further in restructuring <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> than <PERSON>Mr. Corry</PERSON> had planned.
<PERSON>Mr. Icahn</PERSON> advocates the sale of the company's steel operations, and <PERSON>Mr. Corry</PERSON> doesn't necessarily disagree.
Unlike his predecessor, who saw steel as <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s backbone, <PERSON>Mr. Corry</PERSON> tends to view it as a capital-draining and labor-intensive business with limited potential, associates say.
<PERSON>Roderick</PERSON> and <PERSON>Corry</PERSON> view steel so differently.
While <PERSON>Mr. Roderick</PERSON> was reared in the shadows of <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>'s smoking mills, <PERSON>Mr. Corry</PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION>, a city nicknamed "<LOCATION>Porkapolis</LOCATION>" and more accustomed to pork chops than pig iron.
He has never met <PERSON>Lynn Williams</PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION>United Steelworkers</ORGANIZATION> union, and isn't active in the industry's main trade group, the <ORGANIZATION>American Iron and Steel Institute</ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON>Mr. Roderick</PERSON> served as chairman. 
"<PERSON>Dave</PERSON> thought the country needed a strong <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Steel and, while <PERSON>Chuck</PERSON> agreed, he was more apt to say, `Not at any cost to shareholders, '" a former executive says.
With <PERSON>Mr. Icahn</PERSON> breathing down his neck, however, <PERSON>Mr. Corry</PERSON> may have little choice but to sell at a weak price, even if it means losing some steel-related tax-loss carryforwards.
That would leave <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> essentially an oil company with <ORGANIZATION>Marathon</ORGANIZATION> as its core.
Indeed, when the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration finally decided this summer to renew import restrictions -- arguably the most important decision to affect the steel industry in five years -- <PERSON>Mr. Corry</PERSON> and his directors were aboard helicopters, high above Marathon's rich oil reserves in the <LOCATION>North Sea</LOCATION>. 
Should <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> be left with only <ORGANIZATION>Marathon</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Corry</PERSON> might well feel pushed to scout out other energy companies.
One thing is certain, however: <PERSON>Mr. Corry</PERSON>, while studying other options, probably won't make a major move until he's clear about <PERSON>Mr. Icahn</PERSON>'s intentions.
And then, "he won't panic," says <PERSON>J. Bruce Johnston</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> executive and now a labor and benefit consultant with <ORGANIZATION>Adler Cohen & Grigsby</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Corry</PERSON> learned presence under fire when, as vice president of corporate planning, he handled what <PERSON>Mr. Johnston</PERSON> calls "don't-con-me" negotiations that led to <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION>'s shedding of a wide array of assets ranging from chemicals to construction. 
<PERSON>Johnnie Johnson</PERSON>, who worked for <PERSON>Mr. Corry</PERSON> in strategic planning, recalls how his boss would routinely ask a subordinate to research an entire industry to target acquisition candidates. "What he really wanted to know was about a particular company, but you didn't know that.
He wanted your own unbiased, virgin opinion," says <PERSON>Mr. Johnson</PERSON>, now managing director at <ORGANIZATION>Georgeson & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a proxy-solicitation and investor-relations firm. 
Ever the pragmatist, <PERSON>Mr. Corry</PERSON> said in August that he realized that <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> is on "acquisition screens all over the country." 
<PERSON>Philip L. Hall</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>J. Lawrence Hall Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Nashua</LOCATION>, was named a director of this thrift holding company, filling a vacancy. 
<ORGANIZATION>Adolph Coors Co.</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>William K. Coors</PERSON>, chairman, assumed the additional responsibilities of president, succeeding <PERSON>Jeffrey H. Coors</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Jeffrey Coors</PERSON>, 44 years old, had been president since 1985, when he succeeded his father <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> in the job.
But the brewer said <PERSON>Jeffrey Coors</PERSON> voluntarily gave up the position to focus more of his energy on <ORGANIZATION>Coors Technology Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a small unit of <ORGANIZATION>Coors</ORGANIZATION> he has run for several years. 
A <ORGANIZATION>Coors</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the company doesn't believe the move will further increase <PERSON>William Coors</PERSON>'s influence or reduce the influence of <ORGANIZATION>Jeffrey Coors</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Peter Coors</PERSON> or <PERSON>Joseph Coors Jr.</PERSON>, who run the company's three operating units. 
"It certainly wasn't intended to be a demotion," the spokesman said. "Pete and <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joe Jr.</PERSON> have taken over the reins and are doing most of the work.
<PERSON>Jeffrey</PERSON>, <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joseph Jr.</PERSON> are brothers.
<PERSON>Jeffrey</PERSON>, <PERSON>Peter</PERSON>, <PERSON>Joseph Jr.</PERSON>, <PERSON>William</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joseph Sr.</PERSON> constitute the company's board. 
<PERSON>Peter Coors</PERSON> runs the <ORGANIZATION>Coors Brewing Co.</ORGANIZATION> unit, the nation's fourth-largest brewery that accounted for $1.24 billion of <ORGANIZATION>Adolph Coors</ORGANIZATION>'s $1.52 billion in 1988 sales.
<PERSON>Joseph Jr.</PERSON> runs <ORGANIZATION>Coors Ceramics Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the other operating unit, which had about $150 million in 1988 sales. 
Separately, two more of the nation's top steelmakers -- <ORGANIZATION>Armco Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>National Intergroup Inc.</ORGANIZATION> -- reported lower operating earnings in their steel businesses, marking what is generally believed to be the end of a two-year boom in the industry. 
"It doesn't bode well for coming quarters," said <PERSON>John Jacobson</PERSON>, who follows the steel industry for <ORGANIZATION>AUS Consultants</ORGANIZATION>.
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Bethlehem</ORGANIZATION> shares rose 50 cents to $17.375. 
However, in spite of the difficult industrywide environment of high cost and low volume, <PERSON>Bethlehem</PERSON> "had pretty good earnings numbers," said <PERSON>Michelle Galanter Applebaum</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Ms. Applebaum</PERSON> had estimated third-quarter earnings of 55 cents a share, but said the losses for the unusual items were larger than expected. 
"We anticipate that steel market conditions will exhibit a further moderate decline in the fourth quarter as the automotive sector remains weak and customers continue to adjust inventories," said <LOCATION>Bethlehem</LOCATION> Chairman <PERSON>Walter F. Williams</PERSON>.
Sales dropped to $441.1 million from $820.4 million, because the company no longer consolidates its <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Steel</ORGANIZATION> division, which is now a joint venture with <ORGANIZATION>Kawasaki Steel Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Armco</ORGANIZATION> shares closed unchanged at $10.625 in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>National Intergroup</ORGANIZATION>, which owns 50% of the nation's sixth largest steelmaker -- <ORGANIZATION>National Steel Corp.</ORGANIZATION> -- posted net income for the fiscal second-quarter of $8.6 million, or 33 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $50.3 million.
<ORGANIZATION>National Intergroup</ORGANIZATION> stock closed at $15, unchanged in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 
The company noted that its <ORGANIZATION>Fox-Meyer Drug Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Ben Franklin Stores Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Permian Corp.</ORGANIZATION> operations showed improvements as a result of restructuring moves.
<ORGANIZATION>National Intergroup</ORGANIZATION> is negotiating for the sale of its 50% interest in <ORGANIZATION>National Steel</ORGANIZATION> to concentrate more fully on drug distribution operations. 
<ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris Cos.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, adopted a defense measure designed to make a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive. 
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris</ORGANIZATION> shares closed yesterday at $43.50 each, down $1. 
The disarray in the junk-bond market that began last month with a credit crunch at <ORGANIZATION>Campeau Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and the failure of banks to deliver financing for a leveraged buy-out of <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION> has reverberated through some of the nation's largest law firms. 
"We're planning on a rip-roaring year in 1989, but next year we'll be another story," said <PERSON>Robert Freedman</PERSON>, a partner at <ORGANIZATION>Simpson Thacher & Bartlett</ORGANIZATION>. "We're settling down to a less active period." 
Lawyers at such firms as <ORGANIZATION>Sullivan & Cromwell</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Willkie Farr & Gallagher</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Wachtell</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Lipton</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Rosen & Katz</ORGANIZATION>; and Fried, <PERSON>Frank</PERSON>, <PERSON>Harris</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Shriver & Jacobson</ORGANIZATION> all say they, too, have experienced a significant slowdown, particularly during the past few weeks. "Everyone is waiting to see if deals can be done at sensible prices and if money is available," said <PERSON>Jack Nusbaum</PERSON>, co-chairman of <PERSON>Willkie Farr</PERSON>. "It's hard to know right now if the change is fundamental or cyclical." 
<PERSON>Dennis Block</PERSON>, a partner at the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> firm of <ORGANIZATION>Weil, Gotshal & Manges</ORGANIZATION>, said that in the first eight months of this year, 89 hostile offers were launched, compared with 157 for the first eight months of 
Still, some lawyers say the mergers slowdown hasn't affected foreign buyers as much as domestic ones. "We just took another floor for our <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> offices," said <PERSON>Joseph Flom</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> firm of <LOCATION>Skadden</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Arps</ORGANIZATION>, Slate, <ORGANIZATION>Meagher & Flom</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Davis Polk & Wardwell</ORGANIZATION> also said its international clients are keeping mergers and acquisitions partners busy. "European companies are looking to buy American ones," said <PERSON>Henry King</PERSON>, the managing partner at that firm. "But the question is whether things people are looking at will actually surface in live transactions in light of the current market conditions." 
In the trial of former <ORGANIZATION>Haas Securities</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Eugene Laff</PERSON>, the defense accused one of the government's chief witnesses of threatening to kill <PERSON>Mr. Laff</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Laff</PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON>John Lang</PERSON>, filed a memorandum asking that the trial record include a secretly taped conversation in which the witness, <PERSON>Henry Lorin</PERSON>, told a <PERSON>Haas</PERSON> stockbroker that <PERSON>Mr. Laff</PERSON> should be killed.
The conversation was taped by federal investigators in what <PERSON>Mr. Lang</PERSON> said was an effort to get <PERSON>Mr. Lorin</PERSON> to implicate <PERSON>Mr. Laff</PERSON>.
In his opening arguments last week in federal court in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Lang</PERSON> told the jury that <PERSON>Mr. Lorin</PERSON> was the "real master criminal" behind the stock manipulation, and that <PERSON>Mr. Laff</PERSON> knew nothing about it. 
In March, <PERSON>Mr. Laff</PERSON> was indicted on 15 counts of conspiracy, mail and securities fraud, and obstructing an investigation by the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>.
The government has charged that <PERSON>Mr. Lorin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Laff</PERSON> were part of a conspiracy to maintain the prices of certain stocks at artificially high prices.
<PERSON>Mr. Lorin</PERSON>, a stock promoter, pleaded guilty to the stock-manipulation charges in April and agreed to cooperate with the government's investigation of <PERSON>Mr. Laff</PERSON>. 
During his cross examination of <PERSON>Mr. Lorin</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Lang</PERSON> read from the transcripts of a conversation that was taped Oct. 20, 1988.
<PERSON>Stanley Aslanian</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Haas</LOCATION> broker who agreed to carry a hidden microphone during the conversation, also has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities violations in the stock manipulation and agreed to cooperate. 
According to the transcript, <PERSON>Mr. Lorin</PERSON> said <PERSON>Mr. Laff</PERSON> should be killed after <PERSON>Mr. Aslanian</PERSON> told him that information given to <PERSON>Mr. Laff</PERSON> by another conspirator could jeopardize the stock scheme.
<PERSON>Mr. Lorin</PERSON> then repeated the threat, and <PERSON>Mr. Aslanian</PERSON> urged him not to say such things. 
From the parts of the transcript read by <PERSON>Mr. Lang</PERSON>, it was unclear what exactly <PERSON>Mr. Lorin</PERSON> feared might happen.
When asked for a copy of the transcript, <PERSON>Mr. Lang</PERSON> said <PERSON>Judge Thomas P. Griesa</PERSON> had instructed him not to release it or the memorandum. 
During the trial, <PERSON>Mr. Lang</PERSON> asked <PERSON>Mr. Lorin</PERSON> whether he had been so upset "that you considered killing <PERSON>Mr. Laff</PERSON>? . . . Isn't it true that you were so worked up that framing <PERSON>Mr. Laff</PERSON> for this crime was the least that you planned for him?" <PERSON>Mr. Lorin</PERSON> responded, "No." When <PERSON>Mr. Lang</PERSON> asked <PERSON>Mr. Lorin</PERSON> whether he had taken steps to have <PERSON>Mr. Laff</PERSON> killed, the witness again said no. 
<PERSON>Peter Lieb</PERSON>, the assistant <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney prosecuting the case, declined to comment on the trial. 
<PERSON>Stephen A. Saltzburg</PERSON>, one of five trustees appointed to monitor payments to women injured by the <ORGANIZATION>Dalkon Shield</ORGANIZATION> intrauterine contraceptive, resigned, citing personal reasons. 
<PERSON>Mr. Saltzburg</PERSON>, who teaches evidence at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia School of Law</ORGANIZATION> and was a deputy assistant attorney general in the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> until August, submitted his resignation earlier this month to federal <PERSON>Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr.</PERSON>, in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Judge Merhige</PERSON> is overseeing the bankruptcy-law reorganization of <ORGANIZATION>A.H. Robins Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the company that manufactured the shield.
The $2.38 billion <ORGANIZATION>Dalkon Shield Claimants Trust</ORGANIZATION> was established as part of <ORGANIZATION>A.H. Robins</ORGANIZATION>' bankruptcy-reorganization plan to resolve injury claims arising from use of the shield.
The remaining four trustees on the <ORGANIZATION>Claimants Trust</ORGANIZATION> have 60 days to nominate a successor to <PERSON>Mr. Saltzburg</PERSON>.
<LOCATION>CHICAGO</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>LAW FIRM</ORGANIZATION> recruits <ORGANIZATION>American Express Co.</ORGANIZATION> vice president: <ORGANIZATION>Coffield Ungaretti Harris & Slavin</ORGANIZATION> brought in <ORGANIZATION>Howard A. Menell</ORGANIZATION> as a partner in its <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, office, which opened Oct. 1.
For the past six years, <PERSON>Mr. Menell</PERSON>, 43 years old, served as vice president for government affairs at <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>.
THE <LOCATION>PHILADELPHIA</LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION>Ballard</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Spahr</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Andrews & Ingersoll</ORGANIZATION> said three partners have joined its business and <ORGANIZATION>finance department</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>John Ake</PERSON>, 48, a former vice-president in charge of legal compliance at <ORGANIZATION>American Capital Management & Research Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, will join <ORGANIZATION>Ballard Spahr</ORGANIZATION>'s corporate-securities practice.
<PERSON>Kent Walker</PERSON>, 45, a former partner at the <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> law firm of <LOCATION>Mesirov</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Gelman</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Jaffe</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Cramer & Jamieson</ORGANIZATION>, will specialize in antitrust, real estate and mergers and acquisitions.
<PERSON>Mr. Sherman</PERSON> is former deputy general counsel for <ORGANIZATION>SmithKline Beckman Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, now <ORGANIZATION>SmithKline Beecham PLC</ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. 
Currently, <LOCATION>Avon</LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, has 3.3 million common shares outstanding.
The Atlanta-based airline, the third largest in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, attributed the increase to higher passenger traffic, new international routes and reduced service by rival <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, which is in bankruptcy proceedings in the wake of a strike that began last spring. 
During the quarter, <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> issued 2.5 million shares of common stock to <LOCATION>Swissair</LOCATION>, and repurchased 1.1 million shares for use in a company employee stock ownership plan. 
"The key to <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION>'s record earnings continued to be excellent passenger revenue growth," said <PERSON>Thomas Roeck</PERSON>, chief financial officer.
<ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> has benefited more than other carriers from the weakness of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, which shares the <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> hub.
Separately, <ORGANIZATION>America West Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, reported third-quarter profit jumped 45% to $5.8 million, or 28 cents a share, from $4 million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier.
The latest results include a $2.6 million one-time payment from a "foreign entity." <LOCATION>America West</LOCATION> wouldn't identify the entity, but said the payment was for the foreign company's use of certain tax benefits in connection with <ORGANIZATION>America West</ORGANIZATION> plane purchases.
West Texas Intermediate, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> benchmark crude, seemed tethered again yesterday in trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION>.
With no petroleum-related news or changes in the fundamentals to dictate price moves, "technicians are wanting to sell this stuff," said <PERSON>Eric Bolling</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Edge Trading Corp.</ORGANIZATION> "And short-term, the technicians may have their way." 
The market quickly discounted the weekly inventory report showing a 6.3 million barrel decrease in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> crude oil stocks as the legacy of Hurricane <PERSON>Jerry</PERSON>.
That storm hit the <LOCATION>Gulf Coast</LOCATION> Oct. 13, closing the <LOCATION>Louisiana Offshore Oil Port</LOCATION> for a time and preventing tankers from unloading.
To top off the bearish factors affecting yesterday's trading, late October weather, especially in the <LOCATION>Northeast U.S.</LOCATION>, continues to be very moderate, leaving heating oil futures trading lackluster. "We aren't seeing any cold weather here," <PERSON>Mr. Bolling</PERSON> said from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
Neither <PERSON>Mr. Dennis</PERSON> nor officials of his <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> trading company, <ORGANIZATION>C&D Commodities</ORGANIZATION>, could be reached for comment.
As for corn and soybean futures, "a lot of commission house buying this morning and computer-driven buying" supported prices in early trading, said <PERSON>Steven Freed</PERSON>, a futures analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>.
Announced and anticipated purchases from foreign countries are also supporting futures prices. "Russian ships are arriving in the gulf and there isn't enough grain in the pipeline," said <PERSON>Katharina Zimmer</PERSON>, a futures analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
The market is drifting, at least partly, because of a lack of crop information out of <LOCATION>Ghana</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Ivory Coast</LOCATION>, the two largest African producers.
<PERSON>Harry Schwartz</PERSON>, a soft commodity specialist for <ORGANIZATION>Cargill Investors Services</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said the only report <PERSON>Ghana</PERSON> has issued about the arrival of cocoa from the interior was for 7,839 metric tons as of Oct. 12.
<PERSON>Financiere Sucre</PERSON> et Denrees, might not be able to deliver cocoa against the contracts it had sold earlier for December delivery in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
However, the <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> merchant has about 200,000 tons of old crop <LOCATION>Ivory Coast</LOCATION> cocoa stored in the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION> from an agreement it had negotiated with the <ORGANIZATION>Ivory Coast</ORGANIZATION> last spring.
The hottest rivalry in the computer industry intensified sharply yesterday as <ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment Corp.</ORGANIZATION> announced its first line of mainframe computers, targeting <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's largest market. 
Up to now, the intense competition between <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION> has been confined largely to the broad midrange of the computer market, where <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION> sought to exploit <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>'s weaknesses in networking.
But <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION>'s move into mainframes will target <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>'s home turf, where it has a commanding 70% share of the market. 
<ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Maynard</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, insisted yesterday that its marketing focus would differ sharply from <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>'s. "This is not your father's mainframe," said <PERSON>Allan McGuire</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION> spokesman. "It's a whole new generation," he said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION>'s VAX 9000 mainframes, which it claimed were among the fastest available, were priced from $1.2 million to $3.9 million, sharply lower than <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> models of comparable power.
<PERSON>Jay Stevens</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said he may cut his earnings estimate for the current fiscal year because he had expected at least some mainframe profit this year.
After the announcement yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION> shares gained $1.25 to close at $89.875 in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading.
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at $103, down 50 cents, in <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> trading. 
<ORGANIZATION>Large Digital</ORGANIZATION> buyers say the new <ORGANIZATION>VAX</ORGANIZATION> will let them stay with <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION> when they need the power of a mainframe, instead of turning to <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>. "I'm convinced there's a huge market for this machine," said <PERSON>Stephen Smith</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION> also plans to compete fiercely with <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> when the giant's customers are computerizing new aspects of their businesses.
<ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION>, however, doesn't expect to displace <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> mainframes that are already installed at big companies. 
"Demand for these systems has been very, very strong," said <PERSON>Bill Grabe</PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> marketing executive. "We have a good strong backlog for the fourth quarter even without" the systems that were announced yesterday. 
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Armonk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, said it wanted to bring out the mainframes as soon as it could to spark as many sales as possible by the end of the year.
Still, <PERSON>Steve Cohen</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>SoundView Financial Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said, "I don't see that this will be sufficient to give <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> a significant kick in the fourth quarter." 
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> has already indicated it will have problems in the quarter, partly because of a delay in shipping a high-end disk drive and partly because the strong dollar will cut significantly the value of <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>'s overseas earnings when translated into dollars.
That should help <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> address the damage that a resurgent <ORGANIZATION>Storage Technology Corp.</ORGANIZATION> has inflicted in that market. 
Meanwhile, within the next few weeks, the limited partners in <ORGANIZATION>Ivan F. Boesky & Co</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>L.P.</ORGANIZATION> are expected to reach a partial settlement with <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION> regarding the distribution of the $330 million in partnership assets, said one of the individuals.
Under the terms of the settlement, the limited partners would drop their civil suits against <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION>, now pending in federal court in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, another individual said. 
A shareholders' accord would provide the first restitution to thousands of individuals and institutions claiming losses as a result of insider trading by <ORGANIZATION>Boesky & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, once the largest arbitrage fund in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
Stocks involved in the shareholder suits include <ORGANIZATION>Union Carbide</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>RJR Nabisco</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>American Natural Resources</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Boise Cascade Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>General Foods Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Houston Natural Gas</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>FMC Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
There are at least 27 class-action shareholder suits that have been consolidated in federal court in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> under <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Milton Pollack</PERSON>.
Among the defendants are <PERSON>Mr. Boesky</PERSON>; the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION>Ivan F. Boesky & Co.</ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON>Mr. Boesky</PERSON>'s main underwriter, <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham</ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION>Cambrian & General Securities PLC</ORGANIZATION>, a British investment fund once controlled by <PERSON>Mr. Boesky</PERSON>. 
Individuals familiar with the negotiations said the partial settlement being negotiated would remove the <LOCATION>Boesky</LOCATION> partnership, the British fund and <PERSON>Mr. Boesky</PERSON> as defendants, while <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> and other defendants would remain. 
<PERSON>Charles Davidow</PERSON>, of the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, D.C.-based law firm <ORGANIZATION>Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering</ORGANIZATION>, which represents <PERSON>Mr. Boesky</PERSON> in this matter, said only that "discussions are under way.
According to <PERSON>William Orbe</PERSON>, an attorney at <ORGANIZATION>Grais & Richards</ORGANIZATION>, the escrow agents for the fund, as of Sept. 30 the fund amounted to $60.5 million. 
This is because a <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION> court earlier this year said that <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> is entitled to get its money back before or at the same time as the limited partners.
<ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> agreed to plead guilty to six felony counts and pay $650 million, of which $350 million was set aside for shareholders and other plaintiffs, including the limited partners, who claim they were injured by <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION>. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr.</PERSON> ordered the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> to immediately begin processing <PERSON>Herman Benjamin Ferguson</PERSON>'s request for documents stemming from the agency's investigation of him during the 1960s.
<PERSON>Mr. Ferguson</PERSON>, who is 68 years old, fled the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in 1970 after exhausting his appeals of a 1968 conviction on conspiracy to murder.
His attorneys claim he was framed by the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> police as part of a campaign to destroy the black liberation movement of the 1960s. 
Because the federal Freedom of Information Act wasn't law at that time, the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> wasn't required to turn over information on its investigations when <PERSON>Mr. Ferguson</PERSON> appealed his conviction in the 1960s.
But in federal court in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Judge Patterson</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> records could show that <PERSON>Mr. Ferguson</PERSON>'s arrest was the result of questionable legal practices. 
<PERSON>Gabriel W. Gorenstein</PERSON>, the assistant <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney handling the case for the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION>, said no decision has been made about appealing the judge's ruling. 
The study, conducted by a task force of the <ORGANIZATION>Brookings Institution</ORGANIZATION>, suggests that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> should require the courts to develop the plans.
The study was initiated by <ORGANIZATION>Senate Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON>Joseph Biden</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Del.</LOCATION>). 
The <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, think tank recommends that the courts adopt different "tracks" for different types of civil cases in order to separate the handling of highly complex suits from simpler ones.
This is in response to <PERSON>Atsushi Kageyama</PERSON>'s Manager's Journal, "Looking for the Real Thing in <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>" (editorial page, Oct. 2).
Americans are expected to conform to the <LOCATION>Japanese</LOCATION> culture when in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Kageyama</PERSON> suggests that <ORGANIZATION>Kotobuki Electronics Industries</ORGANIZATION> workers were having difficulty understanding their foreign bosses' perspective.
<LOCATION>Tallahassee</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>. 
I believe <PERSON>Mr. Kageyama</PERSON> left out one major aspect of <LOCATION>Japanese</LOCATION> culture that permeated his piece: the belief in the superiority of <LOCATION>Japanese</LOCATION> culture and behavior vs. others. 
For <PERSON>Mr. Kageyama</PERSON> to argue that <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> employees must passively accept a direct imposition of the Japanese way of doing things is outright cultural chauvinism of the first order.
Announcement of the approval is expected to be made by <PERSON>Louis Sullivan</PERSON>, secretary of <ORGANIZATION>Health and Human Services</ORGANIZATION>.
Adults with AIDS have had access to <ORGANIZATION>AZT</ORGANIZATION> since <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> approved the drug's usage for adults in March 1987.
It should have happened sooner," said <PERSON>Elizabeth Glaser</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> mother and activist who contracted the AIDS virus through a blood transfusion, and transmitted it to two of her children.
Secondly, critics have charged <ORGANIZATION>AZT</ORGANIZATION>'s maker <ORGANIZATION>Burroughs Wellcome Co.</ORGANIZATION> with corporate inertia because children account for just 1% of the patient population and hence a small part of the large and lucrative market. 
Still, all this comes nearly a year and a half after <PERSON>Philip Pizzo</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION> offered evidence that <ORGANIZATION>AZT</ORGANIZATION> could reverse the ravages of AIDS dementia, sometimes prompting dramatic recovery of IQ levels and reappearance of lost motor skills.
Why has it taken people so long for people to understand pediatric AIDS is a major problem?" asked <PERSON>Helen Kushnick</PERSON>, whose son <PERSON>Samuel</PERSON> died six years ago at age three, victim of a tainted transfusion. 
"While I'm pleased the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> is finally releasing <ORGANIZATION>AZT</ORGANIZATION> for children, it's taken much too long to get to this point," said Rep. <PERSON>Ted Weiss</PERSON>. "Why did it take <PERSON>Burroughs Wellcome</PERSON> so long to apply" for treatment investigational new drug status? the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Democrat asked. 
<PERSON>Mrs. Glaser</PERSON>, who is a co-founder of the <ORGANIZATION>Pediatric AIDS Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, condemned neither bureaucratic nor corporate foot-dragging. 
"There's no finger to be pointed," she said. "The crucial thing is that we learn our lesson well, and to make sure other experimental drugs, like <ORGANIZATION>Bristol-Myers Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>DDI</ORGANIZATION>, don't follow the same frustrating course as <ORGANIZATION>AZT</ORGANIZATION>." 
"It's impossible to overstate how much this means to the families of these patients," said <PERSON>Samuel Broder</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION> and a main developer of <ORGANIZATION>AZT</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Coda</ORGANIZATION>, an oil and gas concern, said it and its partners received $7 million in cash and $10 million in five-year notes for the <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> intrastate pipeline.

<ORGANIZATION>Levi Strauss Associates Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the closely held owner of <ORGANIZATION>Levi Strauss & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, said its fiscal third-quarter earnings jumped to $128.6 million from $31.3 million a year earlier, aided by a $69.8 million gain from the sale of stock in a <LOCATION>Japanese</LOCATION> subsidiary. 
Except for a few spots, notably <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, failures declined almost across the board, according to the business information services company.

<ORGANIZATION>Computer Associates International</ORGANIZATION>, the most active <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> issue, was another victim of an earnings-related sell-off.
Insurance stocks moved higher in the wake of a strong third-quarter earnings report from <LOCATION>Chubb</LOCATION>, coming on the heels of speculation that last week's devastating earthquake in the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> area would lead to higher premium rates. 
<ORGANIZATION>Aetna Life & Casualty</ORGANIZATION> gained 1 3/8 to 61 1/8, <ORGANIZATION>Cigna</ORGANIZATION> advanced 7/8 to 64 3/4, <ORGANIZATION>Travelers</ORGANIZATION> added 1/2 to 40 3/8 and <ORGANIZATION>American International Group</ORGANIZATION> rose 3 1/8 to 107 3/4. 
<ORGANIZATION>TW Services</ORGANIZATION> dropped 1 1/4 to 31 1/4 following the postponement of a $1.4 billion junk-bond offering that would have permitted <ORGANIZATION>Coniston Partners</ORGANIZATION> to complete its takeover of the company.
<ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stock declined by 9 to 161 after nobody surfaced to claim credit for aggressive buying Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION>Bear Stearns</ORGANIZATION> that sent <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stock up 35 points in a matter of hours.
Tuesday's rumored buyer, <ORGANIZATION>Coniston Partners</ORGANIZATION>, wouldn't comment on speculation that <ORGANIZATION>Coniston</ORGANIZATION>, which battled the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> board in 1987, might challenge the board's decision Monday to remain independent. 
<ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, rose 3 3/8 to 72 1/4; <ORGANIZATION>USAir Group</ORGANIZATION> fell 1 1/2 to 38 5/8, and <ORGANIZATION>Delta Air Lines</ORGANIZATION> rose 1/2 to 66 1/2 after posting higher earnings for the September quarter.

In early trading in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION>Nikkei</ORGANIZATION> index rose 145.45 points to 35587.85. 
A trader at <ORGANIZATION>Yamaichi Securities</ORGANIZATION> said the market's mood was undercut by the continuing fall of <ORGANIZATION>Nippon Telegraph & Telephone</ORGANIZATION> shares, which declined to their lowest level since the begining of this year.
Among pharmaceutical shares, <ORGANIZATION>Chugai</ORGANIZATION> lost 60 yen to 2,290 yen ($16.20), and <ORGANIZATION>Mochida</ORGANIZATION> fell 150 to 4,290. 
<ORGANIZATION>Daiwa House</ORGANIZATION> also ended easier, but <ORGANIZATION>Misawa Home</ORGANIZATION> was firmer. 
<ORGANIZATION>Pioneer Electronic</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>, both of which dominated buying earlier this month, continued to fall Wednesday.
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> was boosted 21 to 715 on follow-through buying after <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor</ORGANIZATION>'s announcement Tuesday that it might be prepared to mount a full bid for the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> luxury auto maker.
It was further helped by <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>, which announced after <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s close that it had raised its stake to 12% from just under 11% on Tuesday. 
"It was dead, listless, depressing and negative," said one trader at a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> bank in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>. "There was little turnover and nothing to stimulate the market." 
Tough talk from trade union officials at the conference of the powerful <ORGANIZATION>IG Metall</ORGANIZATION> metals worker union in <LOCATION>West Berlin</LOCATION> raised the specter of nationwide strikes next spring, they said.
For the 1990 wage negotiations, the <ORGANIZATION>IG Metall</ORGANIZATION> is demanding a further cut in the German workweek and steep wage increases, which could sharply increase the costs for <LOCATION>German</LOCATION> industry. 
In the auto sector, <ORGANIZATION>Bayerische Motoren Werke</ORGANIZATION> plunged 14.5 marks to 529 marks ($288), <ORGANIZATION>Daimler-Benz</ORGANIZATION> dropped 10.5 to 700, and <ORGANIZATION>Volkswagen</ORGANIZATION> slumped 9 to 435.5.

<ORGANIZATION>Lawrence Insurance Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it acquired <ORGANIZATION>United Republic Reinsurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> property and casualty reinsurance company, from <ORGANIZATION>United Savings Association of Texas</ORGANIZATION> for $28 million. 
Lawrence Insurance also sold 3.2 million of its shares for $7.125 each to its parent, <ORGANIZATION>Lawrence Group Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Lawrence Insurance</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Albany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, plans to use the $22.5 million in proceeds to help finance the acquisition of <LOCATION>United Republic</LOCATION>. 
By acquiring the shares, <ORGANIZATION>Lawrence Group</ORGANIZATION> increased its stake in <ORGANIZATION>Lawrence Insurance</ORGANIZATION> to 93.2% from 91.2%.
<ORGANIZATION>Lawrence Group</ORGANIZATION> also owns <ORGANIZATION>Lawrence Agency Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Schenectady</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, an insurance agency and brokerage. 
<ORGANIZATION>ITT</ORGANIZATION> also forecast a fourth-quarter blow to earnings from the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> earthquake.
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>ITT</ORGANIZATION> common stock fell 62.5 cents to close at $58.75 a share. 
<ORGANIZATION>ITT</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Hartford Insurance Group</ORGANIZATION> had a $53 million quarterly pretax loss from Hurricane Hugo, <ORGANIZATION>ITT</ORGANIZATION> said.
<ORGANIZATION>Hartford</ORGANIZATION> expects to report a further pretax loss of about $30 million for the current quarter, as a result of the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> earthquake this month, <ORGANIZATION>ITT</ORGANIZATION> added. 
<ORGANIZATION>ITT</ORGANIZATION> also said its consumer finance unit agreed in September to settle a civil suit with the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> attorney general over alleged improper lending and sales practices.
At a time when <PERSON>Jon Levy</PERSON> should be planning the biggest spring season in his dress company's 17 years, his work day is studded with intense moments of concern about one of his biggest customers, <ORGANIZATION>Campeau Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
"The dress business has always been a gamble, but it's never been like this," says <PERSON>Mr. Levy</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>St. Gillian Group Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, which has become a hot name thanks to a campaign of sexy TV commercials. 
Every day, <PERSON>Mr. Levy</PERSON> checks orders from <ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION> department store chains, trying to guess if he will be paid. "I'm now monitoring every major account." 
<PERSON>Campeau</PERSON>, owner of such retailers as <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale</ORGANIZATION>'s, <PERSON>Bon Marche</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Jordan Marsh</PERSON>, sidestepped financial collapse last month after an emergency $250 million loan from <ORGANIZATION>Olympia & York Developments Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a Canadian developer and a major shareholder in <LOCATION>Campeau</LOCATION>.
The risk of doing business with <ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Federated</ORGANIZATION> and Allied department store chains is about to increase greatly, not only for <PERSON>Mr. Levy</PERSON> but for hundreds of other small apparel makers, button suppliers, trucking firms and fabric houses. 
"It's all anybody wants to talk about," says <PERSON>Richard Posner</PERSON>, executive vice president for <ORGANIZATION>Credit Exchange Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a leading credit service. "People wonder what's going to happen next." 
"The few million dollars I could lose today is nothing against what I could lose on the spring line," says <PERSON>Mr. Levy</PERSON>, who estimates that <ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION> stores will sell $25 million worth of his clothes this year. "I'm buying fabric right now for clothes which I may not be paid for until April or May.
Some credit concerns, such as <ORGANIZATION>Bernard Sands Credit Consultants Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, have told clients not to ship anything to Federated or Allied stores on credit. "This is especially true for spring merchandise," says <PERSON>Jim Rindos</PERSON>, credit manager at <ORGANIZATION>Bernard Sands</ORGANIZATION>. "<PERSON>Campeau</PERSON> has too much debt." 
Other credit houses, such as <ORGANIZATION>Credit Exchange</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Solo Credit Service Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, are suggesting that their clients study each order before shipping. "Payments are good right now, but we aren't recommending any long-term lines of credit," says <PERSON>Richard Hastings</PERSON>, a retail credit analyst, referring to credit lines which make inventory purchases automatic. "The Campeau situation is a little uncertain and very difficult to analyze." 
<ORGANIZATION>Howard Bloom</ORGANIZATION>, president of the dress firm <ORGANIZATION>Chetta B Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, says: "It's big time chaos today.
<PERSON>Carol Sanger</PERSON>, vice president, corporate communications at <LOCATION>Campeau</LOCATION>, says that all of the Federated and Allied chains are paying their bills in a timely manner. "They continue to pay their bills and will do so," says <PERSON>Ms. Sanger</PERSON>. "We're confident we'll be paying our bills for spring merchandise as well." 
"Everybody is worried about the possibility of cancellations," says <PERSON>Kurt Barnard</PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION>Barnard</ORGANIZATION>'s Retail Marketing Report. "The buyers who work for the various <ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION> chains may lose their jobs.
In recent months, numerous retailers have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, including <ORGANIZATION>Bonwit Teller</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>B. Altman & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Miller & Rhoads Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
Those filings, plus the expected sale of a number of financially healthy chains, such as <ORGANIZATION>Saks Fifth Avenue</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Marshall Field</PERSON>'s and <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale</ORGANIZATION>'s, have added to the anxiety. 
"Right now, <PERSON>Federated</PERSON> owes us a considerable amount of money," says <PERSON>Morris Marmalstein</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>David Warren Enterprises</ORGANIZATION>, a major dress manufacturer. "We expect they will be current with their debts by the end of the week, but we are considering asking them for letters of credit before we take more orders." 
<PERSON>Bud Konheim</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Nicole Miller Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, says his company is now shipping only to the flagship stores of the Federated and Allied chains.
<ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Ms. Sanger</PERSON> disputes <PERSON>Mr. Konheim</PERSON>'s comments. "Many of the branches are very lucrative," she says. "That's just nonsense." 
As for <PERSON>Mr. Levy</PERSON> at St. Gillian, he says he will maintain his credit lines with the various <ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION> stores unless they miss a payment. "If they slip for 10 cents for 10 minutes, I'll stop," he says. 
<PERSON>Dennis R. Mangino</PERSON>, a general manager of <ORGANIZATION>EniChem Americas</ORGANIZATION>, was named vice president of research and development, a new post at this steel company. 
<ORGANIZATION>Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Jacobs International</ORGANIZATION> unit was selected to design and build a microcomputer-systems manufacturing plant in <LOCATION>County Kildare</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>, for <ORGANIZATION>Intel Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
In an open letter that will run today in the trade journal <ORGANIZATION>Automotive News</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Ron Tonkin</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>National Car Dealers Association</ORGANIZATION>, says dealers should cut their inventories to no more than half the level traditionally considered desirable. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> car dealers had an average of 59 days' supply of cars in their lots at the end of September, according to <ORGANIZATION>Ward</ORGANIZATION>'s Automotive Reports.
<ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION> representatives criticized <PERSON>Mr. Tonkin</PERSON>'s plan as unworkable.
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> sent to President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> an $8.5 billion military construction bill that cuts spending for new installations by 16% while revamping the Pentagon budget to move more than $450 million from foreign bases to home-state projects. 
The fiscal 1990 measure builds on a pattern set earlier this year by <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> defense authorizing committees, and -- at a time of retrenchment for the military and concern about the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>'s standing in the world economy -- overseas spending is most vulnerable.
Total Pentagon requests for installations in <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, for example, are cut by almost two-thirds, while lawmakers added to the military budget for construction in all but a dozen states at home. 
The extra margin for bases in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> enhances the power of the appropriations committees; meanwhile, lawmakers used their positions to garner as much as six times what the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> had requested for their individual states. 
<ORGANIZATION>House Appropriations Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Jamie Whitten</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Miss.</LOCATION>) helped secure $49.7 million for his state, or more than double the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION>'s budget.
<LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, home of <ORGANIZATION>Senate Appropriations Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Robert Byrd</PERSON>, would receive $21.5 million -- four times the military's request.
<LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, home states of the two Democratic chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> military construction subcommittees, receive $243.2 million, or 25% above the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION>'s request.
Though spending for <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> was far less, their increases above <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> requests -- 640% and 430%, respectively -- were much greater because of the influence of Republicans at critical junctures. 
The swift passage of the bill, which cleared the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> on simple voice votes last week, contrasts with the problems still facing a more cumbersome $66.8 billion measure funding housing, environmental, space and veterans programs.
By an 84-6 margin, the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> approved the bulk of the spending Friday, but the bill was then sent back to the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> to resolve the question of how to address budget limits on credit allocations for the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Housing Administration</ORGANIZATION>. 
For example, a <ORGANIZATION>House-Senate</ORGANIZATION> conference ostensibly increased the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> budget for construction of facilities to nearly $592 million, or more than $200 million above what either chamber had previously approved.
Part of the increase would provide $90 million toward ensuring construction of a costly solid rocket-motor facility in <PERSON>Mr. Whitten</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>.
Conservatives, embarrassed by <ORGANIZATION>Republican</ORGANIZATION> influence-peddling scandals at the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Housing and Urban Development</ORGANIZATION>, have used the issue in an effort to shift blame onto a Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Jack Kemp</PERSON> backed an unsuccessful effort to strike such language last week, but received little support from the White House budget office, which wants to protect space-station funding in the bill and has tended to turn its eyes from pork-barrel amendments. 
Within discretionary funds for community development grants, more than $3.7 million is allocated to six projects in <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, home state of a subcommittee chairman, Rep. <PERSON>Bob Traxler</PERSON>.
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON>Thomas Foley</PERSON> won $510,000 for a project in his district in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> state, and $1.3 million, earmarked by <PERSON>Sen. Daniel Inouye</PERSON>, amounts to a business subsidy under the title "Hawaiian sugar mills job retention." 
When this plan met resistance, it was agreed instead to take money from <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> to subsidize needed improvements in two settling ponds for the mills, which employ an estimated 1,500 workers, according to <PERSON>Mr. Inouye</PERSON>'s office. 
<ORGANIZATION>Wilfred American Educational Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said a federal grand jury in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> indicted the operator of cosmetology and business schools for mail fraud. 
Eight admissions representatives at two of <PERSON>Wilfred</PERSON>'s former <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> schools previously pleaded guilty to charges of aiding, abetting and counseling students to submit false financial-aid applications.
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading Friday, <ORGANIZATION>Wilfred</ORGANIZATION> fell 6.25 cents to 93.75 cents a share. 
<ORGANIZATION>Nikon</ORGANIZATION> said sales rose despite the adverse effect of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s unpopular consumption tax, introduced in April.
Employees of the <ORGANIZATION>Globe</ORGANIZATION> and Mail, a <ORGANIZATION>Thomson Corp.</ORGANIZATION> newspaper in <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>, voted to accept a tentative contract agreement Saturday, averting a strike at <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s leading daily. 
Under the terms of the three-year contract, similar to one reached at <ORGANIZATION>Torstar Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Star</ORGANIZATION> newspaper earlier this month, the 500 Globe and Mail workers will see a raise of 8% in the contract's first year and 7% in each of the following two years. 
<PERSON>Lorne Slotnick</PERSON>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Ontario Newspaper Guild</ORGANIZATION>, the union representing the workers, said <PERSON>Thomson</PERSON> made significant concessions in the final round of talks.
The announcements are scheduled to be made in <ORGANIZATION>Temple</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, and include a so-called "notebook" PC that weighs less than seven pounds, has a built-in hard disk drive and is powered by <ORGANIZATION>Intel Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's 286 microprocessor.
That introduction comes only two weeks after <ORGANIZATION>Compaq Computer Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, believing it had a lead of three to six months on competitors, introduced the first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> notebook computer with such features. 
Despite the inevitable comparison with <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION>, however, <ORGANIZATION>Texas Instruments</ORGANIZATION>' new notebook won't be a direct competitor.
While <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION> sells its machines to businesses through computer retailers, <ORGANIZATION>Texas Instruments</ORGANIZATION> will be selling most of its machines to the industrial market and to value-added resellers and original-equipment manufacturers. 
The laptops are not revolutionary and, indeed, are tardy in a market first opened by <ORGANIZATION>GRiD Systems Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, now a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Tandy Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, almost two years ago. 
List prices on the heavier <ORGANIZATION>Texas Instrument</ORGANIZATION> laptops will be $4,999 for the <ORGANIZATION>TI Model</ORGANIZATION> 25, with a 20 megabyte disk drive, and $5,599 for the 40-megabyte Model 45.
The <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> reports came from <PERSON>Dr. Patrick Toseland</PERSON>, head of clinical chemistry at <LOCATION>Guy's Hospital</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Dr. Solomon Sobel</PERSON>, director of metabolism and endrocrine drug products for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> officials have discussed <PERSON>Dr. Toseland</PERSON>'s findings "fairly intensively." While there have been no reports of similar sudden unexplained deaths among diabetics in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Dr. Sobel</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> plans to examine <PERSON>Dr. Toseland</PERSON>'s evidence and is considering its own study here. 
At the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. National Institutes of Health</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Dr. Robert E. Silverman</PERSON>, chief of the diabetes program branch, said no evidence of unexpected deaths from hypoglycemia had shown up in a study of 1,500 diabetics that has been under way at <ORGANIZATION>NIH</ORGANIZATION> for five years.
Both the <ORGANIZATION>British Diabetic Association</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Committee on Safety in Medicines</ORGANIZATION> -- <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s equivalent of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> -- recently issued statements noting the lack of hard scientific evidence to support <PERSON>Dr. Toseland</PERSON>'s findings.
On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION>American Diabetes Association</ORGANIZATION> issued a similar statement urging the six million <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> diabetics not to overreact to the British report. 
<ORGANIZATION>Eli Lilly & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the Indianapolis-based drug manufacturer, dominates the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> human insulin market with its product known as <PERSON>Humulin</PERSON>.
<ORGANIZATION>Lilly</ORGANIZATION> is building plants to make the insulin in <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Fagershein</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
In its latest annual report, <ORGANIZATION>Lilly</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Humulin</PERSON> sales have shown "excellent growth." 
<PERSON>Dr. Leigh Thompson</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Lilly</ORGANIZATION> group vice president, said the company's clinical trials of both its animal and human-based insulins indicated no difference in the level of hypoglycemia between users of either product. 
<PERSON>Dr. Toseland</PERSON> said most of the British diabetics who died had been taking a human-based insulin made by <ORGANIZATION>Novo/Nordisk</ORGANIZATION>, a Danish manufacturer.
September orders for machine tools rebounded from the summer doldrums, but remained 7.7% below year-earlier levels, according to figures from <ORGANIZATION>NMTBA</ORGANIZATION> -- the <ORGANIZATION>Association for Manufacturing Technology</ORGANIZATION>.
"Overall demand still is very respectable," says <PERSON>Christopher C. Cole</PERSON>, group vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Cincinnati Milacron Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest machine tool producer. "The outlook is positive for the intermediate to long term." 
"September was one of the biggest order months in our history," says <PERSON>James R. Roberts</PERSON>, vice president, world-wide sales and marketing, for <ORGANIZATION>Giddings & Lewis Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, Fond du <LOCATION>Lac</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wis</LOCATION>.
However, there's a continuing dispute between machine tool makers and the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION> over whether sophisticated <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> machine tools would increase the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>'s military might. "The <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> says go, and the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION> says stop," complains one machine tool producer. 
If that controversy continues, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> machine tool makers say, West German and other foreign producers are likely to grab most of the sales in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Volk</PERSON>, 55 years old, succeeds <PERSON>Duncan Dwight</PERSON>, who retired in September. 
In a <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> filing, <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard</ORGANIZATION> said it now holds 1,384,119 Octel common shares, including 100,000 shares bought from Aug. 26 to Oct. 20 for $23.31 to $24.25 a share. 
<ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, computer company, said it acquired the stock "to develop and maintain a strategic partnership in which each company remains independent while working together to market and sell their products." 
<ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard</ORGANIZATION> affirmed it doesn't plan to obtain control of <LOCATION>Octel</LOCATION>, a <LOCATION>Milpitas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, maker of voice-processing systems. 
According to the filing, <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard</ORGANIZATION> acquired 730,070 common shares from <ORGANIZATION>Octel</ORGANIZATION> as a result of an Aug. 10, 1988, stock purchase agreement.
In addition, <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard</ORGANIZATION> acquired a two-year option to buy an extra 10%, of which half may be sold directly to <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard</ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION>Octel</ORGANIZATION>. 
"There is incredible negative psychology building in the market," said <PERSON>Donna Avedisian</PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION> "People are very concerned about who is going to step up to the plate and buy municipal bonds in the absence of institutional buyers." The yield on a group of 25 revenue bonds compiled by the Bond Buyer, a trade publication, now exceeds 7.50%. 
At this week's <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> bond sale, traders expect yields on the 20-year <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> bonds to nearly match the 7.9% yield on 30-year <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bonds.
Big banks such as <ORGANIZATION>Chemical Bank</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Chase Manhattan</ORGANIZATION>, which have been taking heavy charges to expand their Third World loan-loss reserves, aren't looking for tax-exempt income. "We don't need the shelter of tax-free bonds," said a spokeswoman at <ORGANIZATION>Chemical</ORGANIZATION>. 
"There is just so much going on that it's difficult to pick just one factor that's driving the market," said <PERSON>Ronald Ian Heller</PERSON>, vice president at <ORGANIZATION>First Chicago Capital Markets Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>First Chicago Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
They'd like to see some other names in their portfolios," said <PERSON>Michael S. Appelbaum</PERSON>, first vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton</ORGANIZATION>. 
-- The junk bonds of <ORGANIZATION>RJR Nabisco Inc.</ORGANIZATION> rallied Friday on news that the company is selling its candy bar brands to <ORGANIZATION>Nestle Foods Corp.</ORGANIZATION> for $370 million. 
"It shows that there are buyers of high-quality assets at high prices in today's market," said <PERSON>Robert Long</PERSON>, managing director and head of the high-yield research department at <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
Many of the <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION> securities, which had been trading near their 52-week lows earlier in the session, bounced back after the company's announcement that it agreed to sell its Baby Ruth, Butterfinger and <PERSON>Pearson</PERSON> candy businesses to <ORGANIZATION>Nestle Foods</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of the Swiss-based food concern.
The sale, expected to close before the end of the year, also includes a manufacturing plant in <LOCATION>Franklin Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill</LOCATION>. 
The <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kuala Lumpur</LOCATION> stock exchanges are bracing for a turbulent separation, following <LOCATION>Malaysian</LOCATION> Finance Minister <PERSON>Daim Zainuddin</PERSON>'s long-awaited announcement that the exchanges will sever ties. 
On Friday, <PERSON>Datuk Daim</PERSON> added spice to an otherwise unremarkable address on <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>'s proposed budget for 1990 by ordering the <ORGANIZATION>Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> "to take appropriate action immediately" to cut its links with the <ORGANIZATION>Stock Exchange of Singapore</ORGANIZATION>. 
"If you're looking for a significantly higher yield with the same level of risk as a CD, you're not going to find it," says <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> financial planner <PERSON>Dennis M. Gurtz</PERSON>. 
A mix of CDs and other holdings may make the most sense. "People should remember their money isn't all or nothing -- they don't need to be shopping for the one interest-rate-type investment and putting all their money in it," says <LOCATION>Bethesda</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, adviser <PERSON>Karen Schaeffer</PERSON>. 
"It's a no-brainer: You don't have to worry about diversification; you don't have to worry about quality," says <PERSON>Steven J. Hueglin</PERSON>, executive vice president of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> bond firm of <LOCATION>Gabriele</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Hueglin & Cashman Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
Consider a "laddered" bond portfolio, with issues maturing in, say, 1992, 1993 and 1994, advises <PERSON>Malcolm A. Makin</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Westerly</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>R.I.</LOCATION>, financial planner.
"You get equity-like returns" from bonds if you guess right on rates, says <PERSON>James E. Wilson</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, planner.
For instance, a CD-type annuity from <ORGANIZATION>North American Co. for Life & Health Insurance</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, offers 8.8% interest for one year or a 9% rate for two years. 
But at age 55, "they may be a great deal," says <PERSON>Mr. Wilson</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Columbia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, planner. 
Still, today's highest-yielding money funds may beat CDs over the next year even if rates fall, says <PERSON>Guy Witman</PERSON>, an editor of the Bond Market Advisor newsletter in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>.
Try combining a money fund and an intermediate-term bond fund as a low-risk bet on falling rates, suggests <ORGANIZATION>Back Bay Advisors Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a mutual fund unit of <ORGANIZATION>New England Insurance Co</ORGANIZATION>.
Wham! <PERSON>Bam</PERSON>! Twice in two weeks the unraveling of the on-again, off-again <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> buy-out slammed the stock market. 
Opinions vary about how important the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> deal was to the market's health, but analysts generally agree that the market gyrations created as the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> plan crumbled revealed a fundamental change in investor psychology. 
"If this had happened a few months ago when the atmosphere was still very positive it wouldn't have been greeted with anything like the impact it has had over the past two weeks," says <PERSON>Dennis Jarrett</PERSON>, a market strategist at <ORGANIZATION>Kidder Peabody</ORGANIZATION>. 
The reaction to the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> debacle "is mindless," says <PERSON>John Connolly</PERSON>, chief market strategist at <ORGANIZATION>Dean Witter</ORGANIZATION>. "<ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> is a small deal as far as the overall market is concerned.
For the long-term investor who picks stocks carefully, the price volatility can provide welcome buying opportunities as short-term players scramble frantically to sell stocks in a matter of minutes. "Who can make the better decision, the guy who has 10 seconds to decide what to do or the guy with all the time in the world?" he says. "What on earth does the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> deal have to do with the price of <LOCATION>Walmart</LOCATION>, which I was able to buy on Oct. 16 at a very attractive price?" 
<ORGANIZATION>Kidder Peabody</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Jarrett</PERSON> also sees some benefits to the stock market's recent drop. "We've run into a market that was beginning to run out of steam and get frothy," he says. "The balloon had been blown up so big that when somebody came along with a pin -- in this case the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> deal -- we got a little pop." 
Abby <PERSON>Joseph Cohen</PERSON>, a market strategist at <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert</ORGANIZATION>, isn't nearly so sanguine about the market's chances of surging to new highs anytime soon.
Oil stocks escaped the brunt of Friday's selling and several were able to post gains, including <ORGANIZATION>Chevron</ORGANIZATION>, which rose 5/8 to 66 3/8 in <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> composite trading of 2.4 million shares.
Both companies declined to comment on the rumors, but several industry analysts told the Professional Investor Report they believed it was plausible that <ORGANIZATION>Pennzoil</ORGANIZATION> may be buying <ORGANIZATION>Chevron</ORGANIZATION> shares as a prelude to pushing for a restructuring of the company. 
<ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> gained 1/2 to 33 3/8 on a report in Business Week magazine that investor <PERSON>Carl Icahn</PERSON> is said to have raised his stake in the oil and steel company to just about 15%.
Earlier this month, <PERSON>Mr. Icahn</PERSON> boosted his <ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> stake to 13.4%. 
Elsewhere in the oil sector, <ORGANIZATION>Exxon</ORGANIZATION> rallied 7/8 to 45 3/4; <ORGANIZATION>Amoco</ORGANIZATION> rose 1/8 to 47; <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION> was unchanged at 51 3/4, and <ORGANIZATION>Atlantic Richfield</ORGANIZATION> fell 1 5/8 to 99 1/2.
<ORGANIZATION>Hecla Mining</ORGANIZATION> rose 5/8 to 14; <ORGANIZATION>Battle Mountain Gold</ORGANIZATION> climbed 3/4 to 16 3/4; <ORGANIZATION>Homestake Mining</ORGANIZATION> rose 1 1/8 to 16 7/8; <ORGANIZATION>Lac Minerals</ORGANIZATION> added 5/8 to 11; Placer Dome went up 7/8 to 16 3/4, and <ORGANIZATION>ASA Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> jumped 3 5/8 to 49 5/8. 
Echo Bay Mines rose 5/8 to 15 7/8; <ORGANIZATION>Pegasus Gold</ORGANIZATION> advanced 1 1/2 to 12, and <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION> Class A gained 1/2 to 7 1/2. 
<ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment</ORGANIZATION> tacked on 1 1/8 to 89 1/8, and <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard</ORGANIZATION> fell 3/8 to 49 3/8. 
<ORGANIZATION>Comprehensive Care</ORGANIZATION>, which terminated its agreement to merge with <ORGANIZATION>First Hospital</ORGANIZATION>, dropped 7/8 to 3 7/8.
A group of investors led by <ORGANIZATION>Giant Group Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and its chairman, <PERSON>Burt Sugarman</PERSON>, said it filed with federal antitrust regulators for clearance to buy more than 50% of the stock of <ORGANIZATION>Rally's Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a fast-food company based in <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky</LOCATION>. 
The investor group includes Restaurant Investment Partnership, a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> general partnership, and three <ORGANIZATION>Rally</ORGANIZATION>'s directors: <PERSON>Mr. Sugarman</PERSON>, <PERSON>James M. Trotter III</PERSON> and <PERSON>William E. Trotter II</PERSON>.
<ORGANIZATION>Giant Group</ORGANIZATION> owned 22% of <ORGANIZATION>Rally</ORGANIZATION>'s shares before the initial public offering. 
A second group of three company directors, aligned with <ORGANIZATION>Rally</ORGANIZATION>'s founder <PERSON>James Patterson</PERSON>, also is seeking control of the fast-food chain.
And as a result -- as the recent vote by the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> to undo <PERSON>Mr. Cheney</PERSON>'s program terminations suggests -- the preservation of jobs is becoming the real goal of defense "strategy." 
Negative money was invented in 1988 to make the 1990-94 Five Year Defense Plan conform to the numbers in President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s final budget submission to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
Scenario 2 extends the recent compromises between the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>; it splits the difference between Scenarios 1 and 3, by increasing the budget at 2% per year.
But <ORGANIZATION>ZBB</ORGANIZATION> did not involve the strategic planners in the <ORGANIZATION>Joint Chiefs of Staff</ORGANIZATION>, and therefore degenerated into a bean-counting drill driven by budget politics.
It would be run by the joint chiefs under simple directions: Produce the best possible force for each budget scenario and provide the Secretary of <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> with a comprehensive net assessment of how that force could be used to achieve <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> goals. 
This argument plays well in the atmosphere of gaming and mistrust permeating the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, and unfortunately, there is some truth to it.
To say that the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> should act irresponsibly because acting responsibly will provoke <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> into acting irresponsibly leads to the conclusion that the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> should deliberately exaggerate its needs in the national interest; in other words, that it is justified in committing a crime -- lying to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> -- because it is morally superior. 
Strategy is not a game between the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>; it is the art of the possible in a world where constraints force us to choose between unpleasant or imperfect alternatives.
<PERSON>Mr. Spinney</PERSON> is a permanent <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> official.
The company said it has agreed to sell the extrusion division for $15 million to <ORGANIZATION>R.D. Werner Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a closely held firm based in <LOCATION>Greenville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa</LOCATION>. 
The company also said it continues to explore all options concerning the possible sale of <ORGANIZATION>National Aluminum</ORGANIZATION>'s 54.5% stake in an aluminum smelter in <LOCATION>Hawesville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky</LOCATION>. 
A unit of <ORGANIZATION>DPC Acquisition Partners</ORGANIZATION> launched a $10-a-share tender offer for the shares outstanding of <ORGANIZATION>Dataproducts Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, and said it would seek to liquidate the computer-printer maker "as soon as possible," even if a merger isn't consummated. 
<ORGANIZATION>DPC Acquisition</ORGANIZATION> is controlled by <ORGANIZATION>Crescott Investment Associates</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Wilson Investment Group</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Kernel Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Catalyst Partners</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>DPC Acquisition</ORGANIZATION> said it had received the reasonable assurance of <LOCATION>Chase Manhattan Bank N.A.</LOCATION> that the financing can be obtained. 
In a filing with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>DPC Acquisition</ORGANIZATION> said it expects it will need about $215 million to buy the shares and pay related fees and expenses.
<ORGANIZATION>Dataproducts</ORGANIZATION> officials declined to comment, and said they had not yet seen a suit filed in federal court by <ORGANIZATION>DPC Acquisition</ORGANIZATION> that seeks to nullify a standstill agreement between <ORGANIZATION>DPC Acquisition</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Dataproducts</ORGANIZATION>. 
Earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION>DPC Acquisition</ORGANIZATION> made a $15-a-share offer for <ORGANIZATION>Dataproducts</ORGANIZATION>, which the <ORGANIZATION>Dataproducts</ORGANIZATION> board said it rejected because the $283.7 million offer was not fully financed.
<ORGANIZATION>Montedison</ORGANIZATION> now owns about 72% of <ORGANIZATION>Erbamont</ORGANIZATION>'s shares outstanding. 
The companies said the accord was unanimously approved by a special committee of <ORGANIZATION>Erbamont</ORGANIZATION> directors unaffiliated with <ORGANIZATION>Montedison</ORGANIZATION>. 
Under the pact, <ORGANIZATION>Montedision</ORGANIZATION> will make a $37-a-share tender offer for <ORGANIZATION>Erbamont</ORGANIZATION> stock outstanding.
The tender offer will be followed by the sale of all of <ORGANIZATION>Erbamont</ORGANIZATION>'s assets, subject to all of its liabilities, to <LOCATION>Montedison</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Erbamont</ORGANIZATION> will then be liquidated, with any remaining <ORGANIZATION>Erbamont</ORGANIZATION> holders receiving a distribution of $37 a share. 
The companies said the transaction is being structured this way because the laws of the <LOCATION>Netherlands Antilles</LOCATION>, under which <ORGANIZATION>Erbamont</ORGANIZATION> is organized, don't provide for merger transactions. 
Several longtime observers of the commodities industry think the fortunes of the <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> over the next decade will be determined to a large extent by how well its new natural gas futures contract does and how successful its new president is in raising the level of compliance by floor traders with exchange and <ORGANIZATION>Commodity Futures Trading Commission</ORGANIZATION> rules.
If the exchange falters in these moves, they say, it might once again fall behind its chief <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> competitor, the <ORGANIZATION>Commodity Exchange</ORGANIZATION>.
On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION>'s board announced that it had approved <ORGANIZATION>Sabine Pipe Line Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <PERSON>Henry Hub</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Erath</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>La.</LOCATION>, as the delivery site for its long-awaited natural gas futures contract.
Only three weeks earlier, the <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> had turned to one of its own executives, 40-year-old <PERSON>R. Patrick Thompson</PERSON>, to replace <PERSON>Rosemary T. McFadden</PERSON> as president.
<PERSON>Mr. Thompson</PERSON> is believed to have a mandate from the board of directors to help improve the <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION>'s tarnished reputation as an exchange whose floor traders don't follow the rules very well. 
<PERSON>Ms. McFadden</PERSON> had been forced out in July in a bitter power struggle with <PERSON>Z. Lou Guttman</PERSON>, chairman and a longtime floor trader on the exchange.
<PERSON>Mr. Guttman</PERSON> told one person familiar with the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> exchanges during the search for a replacement that he was looking for a president who would be "responsive to the needs of the membership and the board." 
By contrast, the <ORGANIZATION>Comex</ORGANIZATION> in July imported a highly regarded outsider, <PERSON>Arnold F. Staloff</PERSON>, as its president.
<PERSON>Mr. Staloff</PERSON>, 44, was a senior officer of the <ORGANIZATION>Philadelphia Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> and is considered a specialist in new financial products. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION>'s extremely successful contracts in crude oil, gasoline and heating oil have made it the largest futures exchange in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, and third behind the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 
Earlier this year, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney indicted 45 floor traders and one clerk at the two big <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> exchanges.
In a recent <ORGANIZATION>General Accounting Office</ORGANIZATION> study, the <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> was found to have been the most lax in enforcing exchange rules.
The <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> received considerable criticism in 1987 when it was discovered that its compliance director, <PERSON>Kevin P. Conway</PERSON>, who then was responsible for policing the exchange's busy oil and metal pits, "was engaged in other personal business activities on Exchange time," including out-of-state trips, according to a <ORGANIZATION>New York Merc</ORGANIZATION> report prepared last year.
The <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> is now cooperating with the <ORGANIZATION>Comex</ORGANIZATION> in developing such a device to provide such an audit trail.
In January, the <ORGANIZATION>New York Merc</ORGANIZATION> signed a letter of intent with the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Merc</ORGANIZATION> as a preliminary step to joining their electronic system called <ORGANIZATION>Globex</ORGANIZATION>.
But in May, the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Merc</ORGANIZATION> said it was looking into creating a common system with the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Board of Trade</ORGANIZATION>, and it suspended negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION>New York Merc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Thompson</PERSON> says his exchange isn't waiting for the results of the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> exchanges' cooperation.
<PERSON>Michael Frawley</PERSON>, metals trader for <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said there is good technical support between $1.10 and $1.12 a pound for December copper, which ended Friday at $1.1580 a pound, up 1.6 cents.
<PERSON>William O'Neill</PERSON>, research director for <ORGANIZATION>Elders Futures Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said for a rally to occur, there must be demand from the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>.
Friday's strong price gains confirmed a turnaround in the precious metals markets, according to <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Frawley</PERSON>. "Most traders will be looking to buy {on} pullbacks," he said. 
<PERSON>William O'Neill</PERSON>, research director for <ORGANIZATION>Elders Futures Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said the price action for all of last week is the best he has seen on a weekly basis in more than a year.
Prices this week will likely be dominated by reports on the progress of the corn and soybean harvest as well as by speculation about more purchases of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> crops by the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>. 
If the weather allowed farmers to work in their fields over the weekend, many <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> grain elevators will probably sell futures contracts today at the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Board of Trade</ORGANIZATION> in order to hedge their weekend purchases from farmers.
Traders will also watch for whether the <ORGANIZATION>Soviet Union</ORGANIZATION> continues its traditional fall buying of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> grain.
A frozen mountaintop in <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> may offer an important clue about whether the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> is warming perilously. 
Researchers at <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State University</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Geocryology</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> have analyzed samples of glacial ice in <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> and say temperatures there have been significantly higher on average over the past half-century than in any similar period in the past 10,000 years. 
"If you can use data to reconstruct what happened in the past, you have much more confidence in predictions for the future," said <PERSON>Lonnie Thompson</PERSON>, a research scientist at <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> State who dug for and analyzed the ice samples. 
Analysis of ice from the <ORGANIZATION>Dunde</ORGANIZATION> ice cap, a glacial plateau in <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> 17,000 feet above sea level, show that average temperatures were higher in 1937-87 than in any other 50-year period since before the last Ice Age, <PERSON>Mr. Thompson</PERSON> said.
But he said ice samples from <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Greenland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> all show substantial signs of warming. 
In Thursday's edition, it was incorrectly indicated that the union had paid a fee to former <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON>Jim Wright</PERSON>. 
(See: "In Nation's Capital, Scandal Needn't Cut One's Speaking Fee --- <PERSON>Jim Wright</PERSON>, <PERSON>Michael Deaver</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Host of Others Find Careers</ORGANIZATION> After Disgrace" -- WSJ Oct. 26, 1989) 
<ORGANIZATION>Presidio Oil Co.</ORGANIZATION> said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Canada Resources Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> 's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unit for $163 million. 
Presidio, a <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> oil and gas concern, said it will acquire the properties and operations of <ORGANIZATION>Home Petroleum Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which includes two regional gas-gathering systems and proved reserves of about nine million barrels of oil and 72 billion cubic feet of natural gas. 
Presidio said the properties are generally situated in <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>Gulf Canada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calgary</LOCATION>, said the transaction is part of its plan to sell non-strategic assets and focus operations on <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> and other international areas. 
A spokesman for <LOCATION>Gulf Canada</LOCATION>, which is controlled by <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Reichmann</PERSON> family, said the properties account for about 6% of the company's assets and produce about 5,000 barrels of oil and 35 million cubic feet of gas a day.

<ORGANIZATION>Appalachian Power Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>American Electric Power Co.</ORGANIZATION>, said it will redeem on Dec. 1 the entire $44.2 million of its 12 7/8% first mortgage bonds due 2013. 
<ORGANIZATION>Mobil Corp.</ORGANIZATION> is in the midst of cutting back its exploration and production group, which finds and develops oil and gas reserves in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, by as much as 15% as part of a new restructuring of that sector of its business. 
But since then <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> oil production has declined and <ORGANIZATION>Mobil</ORGANIZATION> wants to focus its oil-finding efforts overseas. 
On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION>Mobil</ORGANIZATION> will begin offering separation packages and voluntary retirement in its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> production operation.
For greater efficiency, employees at those locations will be reorganized into teams responsible for managing the properties under their jurisdiction, <ORGANIZATION>Mobil</ORGANIZATION> said. "The main feature of the new organization is that each local manager will have both the authority and accountability for profitable and technically sound operations," said <PERSON>Charles E. Spruell</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Mobil</ORGANIZATION> unit. 
Field offices at <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Midland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tex.</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Bakersfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Oklahoma City</LOCATION>; and <LOCATION>Liberal</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kan.</LOCATION>, will be maintained.
But on the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION>, where profitable oil production is more likely than in the midcontinent region, the <LOCATION>Bakersfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, office staff of 130 will grow by 175 to 305.
QUANTUM <ORGANIZATION>CHEMICAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's plant in <LOCATION>Morris</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, is expected to resume production in early 1990.
Rated single-B-1 by <ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and single-B-plus by <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor's Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the issue will be sold through underwriters led by <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
Rated single-A-3 by <ORGANIZATION>Moody's</ORGANIZATION> and triple-B by <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION>, the issue will be sold through underwriters led by <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>) -- 10 billion yen of 5.7% bonds due Nov. 17, 1992, priced at 101 1/4 to yield 5.75% less full fees, via <ORGANIZATION>LTCB International Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. Fees 1 3/8. 
Three new issues begin trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> today, and one began trading on the <ORGANIZATION>Nasdaq/National Market System</ORGANIZATION> last week. 
On the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Crawford & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, (CFD) begins trading today.
Also beginning trading today on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> are <ORGANIZATION>El Paso Refinery Limited Partnership</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>El Paso</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, (ELP) and <LOCATION>Franklin</LOCATION> Multi-Income Trust, <LOCATION>San Mateo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, (FMI).
On the Nasdaq over-the-counter system, <ORGANIZATION>Allied Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, (<ORGANIZATION>ALII</ORGANIZATION>) began trading last Thursday.
<PERSON>Mr. Vaux</PERSON> said the share issue is part of a strategy to strengthen <PERSON>Labatt</PERSON>'s balance sheet in anticipation of acquisitions to be made during the next 12 to 18 months.
Last year, <PERSON>Dentsu</PERSON> started <ORGANIZATION>HDM</ORGANIZATION>, a joint network with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ad agency <ORGANIZATION>Young & Rubicam</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Eurocom</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
A few months ago, <ORGANIZATION>Dentsu</ORGANIZATION> acquired 69% of Australian agency <ORGANIZATION>Fortune Communication Holdings Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> for 5.9 million Australian dollars (US$4.6 million).
<LOCATION>Dentsu</LOCATION> has <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> subsidiaries, but they keep low profiles. 
Now, the giant marketing company, which holds 25% of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s 4.4 trillion yen ($30.96 billion) advertising industry, is considering the acquisition of an advertising network in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
What is driving <PERSON>Dentsu</PERSON>'s international expansion largely is the need to keep up with its Japanese clients as they grow in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. "If we don't do something . . . we won't be able to catch up with demand," says a <LOCATION>Dentsu</LOCATION> spokesman. "Our president said acquisition is an effective method." 
For example, the spokesman says <PERSON>Dentsu</PERSON> has been approached by banks and securities companies a number of times to invest in the troubled British marketing group <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi & Saatchi PLC</ORGANIZATION>.
But he said <PERSON>Dentsu</PERSON> hasn't looked seriously at <LOCATION>Saatchi</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Dentsu</PERSON>'s billings last year were larger than those of <ORGANIZATION>Young & Rubicam</ORGANIZATION>, the world's second-largest ad agency, according to a survey by the publication Advertising Age. 
On its own, <PERSON>Dentsu</PERSON>'s muscle in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> may count for little in major foreign markets when seeking non-Japanese clients.
Japanese agencies do business with rival clients in the same industry, a practice "that would be unacceptable by traditional <LOCATION>Western</LOCATION> conflict rules," says <PERSON>Roy Warman</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi & Saatchi</ORGANIZATION>'s communications division. 
But the different business system would make it hard for <LOCATION>Dentsu</LOCATION> to provide these Japanese companies the same kind of services they do in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> trimmed about 40 firms from its approved local counsel list, <PERSON>Mr. Pearce</PERSON> says. 
<PERSON>Mr. Pearce</PERSON> set up <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s first in-house litigation group in May with four lawyers, all former assistant <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorneys with extensive trial experience.
Among the types of cases the in-house litigators handle are disputes involving companies doing business with <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> and product-related actions, including one in which a driver is suing <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> for damages resulting from an accident. 
<PERSON>Mr. Pearce</PERSON> has also encouraged his staff to work more closely with <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s technical staffs to help prevent future litigation.
<PERSON>Mr. Pearce</PERSON> says law firms with the best chance of retaining or winning business with <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> will be those providing the highest-quality service at the best cost -- echoing similar directives from <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s auto operations to suppliers. 
This doesn't necessarily mean larger firms have an advantage; <PERSON>Mr. Pearce</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> works with a number of smaller firms it regards highly.
<PERSON>Mr. Pearce</PERSON> has shaken up <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s legal staff by eliminating all titles and establishing several new functions, including a special-projects group that has made films on safety and drunk driving. 
That's a finding of a new study of the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> by researchers at <ORGANIZATION>Syracuse University</ORGANIZATION>.
The study covered 11 major <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorneys' offices -- including those in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> -- from 1980 to 1987. 
"One possible explanation for this decline" in taking cases to trial, says <PERSON>Mr. Burnham</PERSON>, "is that the number of defendants being charged with crimes by all <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorneys has substantially increased." 
On the civil side, the <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> prosecutor filed an average of only 11 cases for every 100,000 adults during the same period; the <LOCATION>San Francisco U.S.</LOCATION> attorney averaged 79. 
The former first lady of the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, asked a federal court in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> to dismiss an indictment against her, claiming among other things, that she was abducted from her homeland.
<PERSON>Mrs. Marcos</PERSON> and her late husband, former <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> President <PERSON>Ferdinand Marcos</PERSON>, were charged with embezzling more than $100 million from that country and then fraudulently concealing much of the money through purchases of prime real estate in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mrs. Marcos</PERSON>'s attorneys asked federal <PERSON>Judge John F. Keenan</PERSON> to give them access to all <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> documents about her alleged abduction.
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney's office, in documents it filed in response, said <PERSON>Mrs. Marcos</PERSON> was making the "fanciful -- and factually unsupported -- claim that she was kidnapped into this country" in order to obtain classified material in the case.
The office also said <PERSON>Mrs. Marcos</PERSON> and her husband weren't brought to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> against their will after <PERSON>Mr. Marcos</PERSON> was ousted as president.
The prosecutor quoted statements from the Marcoses in which they said they were in this country at the invitation of President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> and that they were enjoying the hospitality of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
Lawyers for <PERSON>Mrs. Marcos</PERSON> say that because she was taken to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> against her wishes, the federal court lacks jurisdiction in the case. 
THE FEDERAL COURT of appeals in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> ruled that the dismissal of a 1980 indictment against former <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Crete</ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON>George Koskotas</PERSON> should be reconsidered.
He made numerous trips to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in the early 1980s, but wasn't arrested until 1987 when he showed up as a guest of then-Vice President <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> at a government function.
<PERSON>Mr. Koskotas</PERSON> is fighting extradition proceedings that would return him to <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>, where he is charged with embezzling more than $250 million from the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Crete</ORGANIZATION>.
The state bar association's policy making body, the <ORGANIZATION>House of Delegate</ORGANIZATION>, voted Saturday to ask Chief <PERSON>Judge Sol Wachtler</PERSON> to give the bar's voluntary program three years to prove its effectiveness before considering mandatory pro bono. "We believe our suggested plan is more likely to improve the availability of quality legal service to the poor than is the proposed mandatory pro bono plan and will achieve that objective without the divisiveness, distraction, administrative burdens and possible failure that we fear would accompany an attempt to impose a mandatory plan," said <PERSON>Justin L. Vigdor of Rochester</PERSON>, who headed the bar's pro bono study committee. 
DALLAS AND <LOCATION>HOUSTON</LOCATION> law firms merge: <ORGANIZATION>Jackson & Walker</ORGANIZATION>, a 130-lawyer firm in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Datson & Scofield</ORGANIZATION>, a 70-lawyer firm in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> said they have agreed in principle to merge.
The consolidated firm, which would rank among the 10 largest in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, would operate under the name <ORGANIZATION>Jackson & Walker</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Jackson & Walker</ORGANIZATION> has an office in <LOCATION>Fort Worth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Dotson & Scofield</ORGANIZATION> has an office in <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>. 
Piggybacking on government assertions that <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> may have covered up fraudulent billings to the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION>, two shareholders have filed a civil racketeering suit against the company.
The suit was filed by plaintiffs' securities lawyer <PERSON>Richard D. Greenfield</PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION>U.S. District Court</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>.
The premium the elderly pay for coverage of doctor's bills under Part B of the <ORGANIZATION>Medicare</ORGANIZATION> health insurance plan will rise to $29 a month in 1990 from $27.90, the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Health and Human Services</ORGANIZATION> said. 
The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> has voted to repeal most of the Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, however, which would end the monthly catastrophic-care premium, as well as an unpopular income surtax paid by about 40% of the wealthier <ORGANIZATION>Medicare</ORGANIZATION> beneficiaries. 
Both the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> bills to reduce the cost and coverage of the catastrophic-care plan would eliminate the cap on doctor's bills. 
If the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> plan prevails, the premium will be $33.90, with the additional $4.90 going to pay for expanded hospital coverage under Part A of <ORGANIZATION>Medicare</ORGANIZATION>.
Retailers in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> and parts of the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION> are entering the critical Christmas shopping season with more momentum than those in other regions. 
In a new report, the <ORGANIZATION>International Council of Shopping Centers</ORGANIZATION> said sales of general merchandise in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> for the first seven months of 1989 rose 6.6% above year-earlier levels. 
But sales in the oil-patch state of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> surged 12.9% and sales in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> jumped 10.6% in the period, the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> trade group said. 
In the <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION>, however, sales declined 0.4% in the period, with sales in <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> falling 2.6%. 
The <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION> earthquake and Hurricane Hugo are likely to temporarily damp sales growth in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>.
The information on 125 metropolitan markets is supplied by retailers such as <ORGANIZATION>Sears, Roebuck & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>K mart Corp.</ORGANIZATION> as well as closely held concerns such as <ORGANIZATION>R.H. Macy & Co</ORGANIZATION>.
<LOCATION>El Paso</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Fort Worth</LOCATION>, the three strongest retail markets in the nation, are all located in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, where employment grew a relatively strong 2%.
<LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, which has lost jobs in the computer and defense-related industries, was the weakest link in bleak <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>. 
In 1987, the West had the slowest sales growth, and the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> were first and second respectively, according to the council. 
<PERSON>Mr. Lagnado</PERSON> said that although retailers probably won't ever recover sales lost because of the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> quake and Hurricane Hugo, they could see some benefits later on.
It's a script pieced together from interviews by <ORGANIZATION>CBS News</ORGANIZATION> for a re-enactment, a dramatic rendering by an actor of <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON>'s ultimately unsuccessful struggle with depression. 
<PERSON>Abbie Hoffman</PERSON> in this case is to be played by <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> actor <PERSON>Paul Lieber</PERSON>, who isn't new to the character.
He was <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> in a 1979 <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> production of a play called "The <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> Conspiracy Trial." 
But, as <ORGANIZATION>CBS Broadcast Group</ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON>Howard Stringer</PERSON> puts it, the network now needs to "broaden the horizons of nonfiction television, and that includes some experimentation." 
Since its premiere Sept. 16, the show on which <PERSON>Ms. Chung</PERSON> appears has used an actor to portray the Rev. <PERSON>Vernon Johns</PERSON>, a civil-rights leader, and one to play a teenage drug dealer.
It has depicted the bombing of <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> flight 103 over the Scottish town of <LOCATION>Lockerbie</LOCATION>.
On Oct. 21, it did a rendition of the kidnapping and imprisonment of <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON>Terry Anderson</PERSON>, who was abducted in March 1985 and is believed to be held in <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>.
The production had actors playing <PERSON>Mr. Anderson</PERSON> and former hostages <PERSON>David Jacobsen</PERSON>, the Rev. <PERSON>Benjamin Weir</PERSON> and <PERSON>Father Lawrence Jenco</PERSON>. 
<ORGANIZATION>ABC News</ORGANIZATION> has similarly branched out into entertainment gimmickry. "Prime Time Live," a new show this season featuring <PERSON>Sam Donaldson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Diane Sawyer</PERSON>, has a studio audience that applauds and that one night (to the embarrassment of the network) waved at the camera like the crowd on "Let's Make a Deal." (<ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> stops short of using an "applause" sign and a comic to warm up the audience.
The stars do that themselves.) <ORGANIZATION>NBC News</ORGANIZATION> has produced three episodes of an occasional series produced by <PERSON>Sid Feders</PERSON> called "Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow," starring <PERSON>Maria Shriver</PERSON>, <PERSON>Chuck Scarborough</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mary Alice Williams</PERSON>, that also gives work to actors. 
Re-enactments have been used successfully for several seasons on such syndicated "tabloid TV" shows as "A Current Affair," which is produced by the <ORGANIZATION>Fox Broadcasting Co.</ORGANIZATION> unit of <PERSON>Rupert Murdoch</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>News Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
That show, whose host is <PERSON>Ms. Chung</PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON>Maury Povich</PERSON>, has a particular penchant for grisly murders and stories having to do with sex -- the <PERSON>Robert Chambers</PERSON> murder case, the <PERSON>Rob Lowe</PERSON> tapes, what have you. 
At 555 W. 57th St. in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, one floor below the offices of "60 Minutes," the most successful prime-time news program ever, actors wait in the reception area to audition for "Saturday Night With <PERSON>Connie Chung</PERSON>." 
The network deals a lot with unknowns, including <PERSON>Scott Wentworth</PERSON>, who portrayed <PERSON>Mr. Anderson</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Bill Alton</PERSON> as <PERSON>Father Jenco</PERSON>, but the network has some big names to contend with, too.
<PERSON>James Earl Jones</PERSON> is cast to play the Rev. <PERSON>Mr. Johns</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Ned Beatty</PERSON> may portray former <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Pat Brown</PERSON> in a forthcoming epsiode on <PERSON>Caryl Chessman</PERSON>, the last man to be executed in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, in 1960. 
"Saturday Night" has cast actors to appear in future stories ranging from the abortion rights of teen-agers to a Nov. 4 segment on a man named <PERSON>Willie Bosket</PERSON>, who calls himself a "monster" and is reputed to be the toughest prisoner in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
That isn't much compared with what <PERSON>Bill Cosby</PERSON> makes, or even <PERSON>Connie Chung</PERSON> for that matter (who is paid $1.6 million a year and who recently did a guest shot of her own on the sitcom "Murphy Brown").
<ORGANIZATION>CBS News</ORGANIZATION> is also re-enacting the 1979 Three Mile <LOCATION>Island</LOCATION> nuclear accident in <LOCATION>Middletown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, with something less than a cast of thousands.
On Oct. 20, the town's mayor, <PERSON>Robert Reid</PERSON>, made an announcement on behalf of <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> during half-time at the <ORGANIZATION>Middletown High School</ORGANIZATION> football game asking for volunteers. 
"There was a roll of laughter through the stands," says <PERSON>Joe Sukle</PERSON>, the editor of the weekly <ORGANIZATION>Press and Journal</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Middletown</LOCATION>. "They're filming right now at the bank down the street, and they want shots of people getting out of cars and kids on skateboards.
Though a re-enactment may have the flavor, <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> on the <LOCATION>Hudson</LOCATION> it isn't.
In his review of "Saturday Night With <PERSON>Connie Chung</PERSON>," <PERSON>Tom Shales</PERSON>, the TV critic of the <ORGANIZATION>Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> and generally an admirer of <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>, wrote that while the show is "impressive, . . . one has to wonder if this is the proper direction for a network news division to take." 
Re-creating events has, in general, upset news traditionalists, including former CBS News President <PERSON>Richard S. Salant</PERSON> and former NBC News President <PERSON>Reuven Frank</PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION>CBS News</ORGANIZATION> anchorman <PERSON>Walter Cronkite</PERSON> and the new dean of the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Joan Konner</PERSON>.
That includes his companion of 15 years, <PERSON>Johanna Lawrenson</PERSON>, as well as his former wife, <PERSON>Anita</PERSON>.
Both women say they also find it distasteful that <ORGANIZATION>CBS News</ORGANIZATION> is apparently concentrating on <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON>'s problems as a manic-depressive. 
"This is dangerous and misrepresents <PERSON>Abbie</PERSON>'s life," says <PERSON>Ms. Lawrenson</PERSON>, who has had an advance look at the 36-page script. "It's a sensational piece about someone who is not here to defend himself." 
<ORGANIZATION>CBS News</ORGANIZATION> interviewed <PERSON>Jack Hoffman</PERSON> and his sister, <PERSON>Phyllis</PERSON>, as well as <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON>'s landlord in <LOCATION>Solebury Township</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa</LOCATION>.
Also <PERSON>Jonathan Silvers</PERSON>, who collaborated with <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> on two books. 
<PERSON>Mr. Silvers</PERSON> says, "I wanted to be interviewed to get <PERSON>Abbie</PERSON>'s story out, and maybe talking about the illness will do some good." 
The executive producer of "Saturday Night With <PERSON>Connie Chung</PERSON>," <PERSON>Andrew Lack</PERSON>, declines to discuss re-creactions as a practice or his show, in particular. "I don't talk about my work," he says.
The president of <ORGANIZATION>CBS News</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>David W. Burke</PERSON>, didn't return numerous telephone calls. 
One person close to the process says it would not be in the best interest of <ORGANIZATION>CBS News</ORGANIZATION> to comment on a "work in progress," such as the Hoffman re-creation, but says <ORGANIZATION>CBS News</ORGANIZATION> is "aware" of the concerns of <PERSON>Ms. Lawrenson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON>'s former wife.
Neither woman was invited by <ORGANIZATION>CBS News</ORGANIZATION> to participate in a round-table discussion about <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON> that is to follow the re-enactment. 
<PERSON>Mr. Lieber</PERSON>, the actor who plays <PERSON>Mr. Hoffman</PERSON>, says he was concerned at first that the script would "misrepresent an astute political mind, one that I admired," but that his concerns were allayed.
The tentative settlement between <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Power</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Pensacola</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, electric company, and federal prosecutors would mark the end of one part of a wide-ranging inquiry of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Co.</ORGANIZATION> in the past year.
A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Southern Co.</ORGANIZATION> would say only that discussions are continuing between <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Power</ORGANIZATION> and federal prosecutors. "We have no further developments to report," he said.
<ORGANIZATION>While Southern Co.</ORGANIZATION> has been reluctant to discuss the grand jury investigations, <PERSON>Edward L. Addison</PERSON>, chief executive officer, has said the company is prepared to defend its tax and acccounting practices if any charges are brought against it.
Morever, <PERSON>Mr. Addison</PERSON> has said <ORGANIZATION>Southern Co.</ORGANIZATION> and its units don't condone illegal political contributions.
Neither <PERSON>Mr. Addison</PERSON> nor any other <ORGANIZATION>Southern Co.</ORGANIZATION> official has been charged with any wrongdoing in connection with the current inquiries. 
The probe of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Co.</ORGANIZATION> has attracted considerable attention this year because of several events that have befallen the company, including the death of a <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Power</ORGANIZATION> executive in a plane crash and the disappearance of a company vendor who was to be a key grand jury witness. 
Witnesses have said the grand jury has asked numerous questions about <PERSON>Jacob F. "Jake" Horton</PERSON>, the senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Power</ORGANIZATION> who died in the plane crash in April.
<PERSON>Mr. Horton</PERSON> oversaw <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Power</ORGANIZATION>'s governmental-affairs efforts.
<ORGANIZATION>Lion Nathan Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> brewing and retail concern, said Friday that <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Holdings Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> is "committed" to a transaction whereby Lion Nathan would acquire 50% of Bond's Australian brewing assets. 
Lion <PERSON>Nathan</PERSON> issued a statement saying it is applying to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Companies & Securities Commission</ORGANIZATION>, the nation's corporate watchdog agency, for a modification to takeover regulations "similar to that obtained by" <ORGANIZATION>S.A. Brewing Holdings Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>SA Brewing</ORGANIZATION>, an Australian brewer, last Thursday was given approval to acquire an option for up to 20% of <ORGANIZATION>Bell Resources Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>S.A.</ORGANIZATION> brewing would make a takeover offer for all of <ORGANIZATION>Bell Resources</ORGANIZATION> if it exercises the option, according to the commission. 
"Lion <PERSON>Nathan</PERSON> has a concluded contract with Bond and <ORGANIZATION>Bell Resources</ORGANIZATION>," said <PERSON>Douglas Myers</PERSON>, chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Lion Nathan</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Jayark Corp.</ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay $4 million in cash, $2 million of 12% convertible debentures, and 1.6 million common shares to acquire closely held <ORGANIZATION>Kofcoh Imports Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Kofcoh</PERSON> is a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> holding company for <ORGANIZATION>Rosalco Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which imports furniture and other items.
<PERSON>David L. Koffman</PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <PERSON>Jayark</PERSON>, holds about 40% of <LOCATION>Kofcoh</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Jayark</PERSON> said. 
<PERSON>Jayark</PERSON>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, distributes and rents audio-visual equipment and prints promotional ads for retailers.
<ORGANIZATION>Lockheed Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it will trim its <ORGANIZATION>Aeronautical Systems</ORGANIZATION> work force in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> by several hundred workers, reflecting the defense industry's decline. 
<ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> contractors "cannot continue to get contracts on that basis," said <PERSON>Howard Rubel</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>C.J. Lawrence</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Grenfell Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. "The pain is too great." 
This maker of electronic devices said it replaced all five incumbent directors at a special meeting called by <PERSON>Milton B. Hollander</PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION>High Technology Holding Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Stamford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION> acquired most of its 49.4% stake in <LOCATION>Newport</LOCATION> in August.
Elected as directors were <PERSON>Mr. Hollander</PERSON>, <PERSON>Frederick Ezekiel</PERSON>, <PERSON>Frederick Ross</PERSON>, <PERSON>Arthur B. Crozier</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rose Pothier</PERSON>.
Removed from office were <PERSON>George Pratt</PERSON>, <PERSON>Robert E. Davis</PERSON>, <PERSON>Norman Gray</PERSON>, <PERSON>John Virtue</PERSON>, corporate secretary, and <PERSON>Barrett B. Weekes</PERSON>, chairman, president and chief executive officer.
<ORGANIZATION>Newport</ORGANIZATION> officials didn't respond Friday to requests to discuss the changes at the company but earlier, <PERSON>Mr. Weekes</PERSON> had said <PERSON>Mr. Hollander</PERSON> wanted to have his own team on the board. 
The agreement was announced by Costa Rican President <PERSON>Oscar Arias</PERSON> Friday, as President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and other leaders from the Western Hemisphere gathered in the Central American nation for a celebration of democracy.
<LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> had been negotiating with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and other banks for three years, but the debt plan was rushed to completion in order to be announced at the meeting.
<ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Nicholas Brady</PERSON> called the agreement "an important step forward in the strengthened debt strategy," noting that it will "when implemented, provide significant reduction in the level of debt and debt service owed by <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>." 
The <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> are expected to provide approximately $180 million to help support the deal, and additional funds are expected from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> officials say the Costa Rican agreement demonstrates that the Brady debt plan can benefit small debtor countries as well as big debtors, such as <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ciba-Geigy AG</ORGANIZATION>, the big Swiss chemicals company, said that it agreed in a letter of intent with <ORGANIZATION>Corning Inc.</ORGANIZATION> to acquire <PERSON>Corning</PERSON>'s 50% share of <ORGANIZATION>Ciba Corning Diagnostics Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Medfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ciba-Geigy</ORGANIZATION> intends to develop the <ORGANIZATION>Ciba Corning</ORGANIZATION> unit into a "substantial business," making the unit an "integral part" of <ORGANIZATION>Ciba-Geigy</ORGANIZATION>'s "comprehensive disease management concept." 
The <ORGANIZATION>Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Circuit</ORGANIZATION> was created in 1982 to serve, among other things, as the court of last resort for most patent disputes.
But the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration thought otherwise, and so may the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration. 
Now only three of the 12 judges -- <PERSON>Pauline Newman</PERSON>, Chief <PERSON>Judge Howard T. Markey</PERSON>, 68, and <PERSON>Giles Rich</PERSON>, 85 -- have patent-law backgrounds.
Several organizations, including the <ORGANIZATION>Industrial Biotechnical Association</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association</ORGANIZATION>, have asked the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> to name candidates with both patent and scientific backgrounds.
Some of the associations have recommended <PERSON>Dr. Alan D. Lourie</PERSON>, 54, a former patent agent with a doctorate in organic chemistry who now is associate general counsel with <ORGANIZATION>SmithKline Beckman Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Dr. Lourie</PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> interviewed him last July. 
Their effort has received a lukewarm response from the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>. "We do not feel that seats are reserved (for patent lawyers)," says <ORGANIZATION>Justice</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>David Runkel</PERSON>, who declines to say how soon a candidate will be named. "But we will take it into consideration." 
The <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>'s view is shared by other lawyers and at least one member of the court, <PERSON>Judge H. Robert Mayer</PERSON>, a former civil litigator who served at the claims court trial level before he was appointed to the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Circuit</ORGANIZATION> two years ago. "I believe that any good lawyer should be able to figure out and understand patent law," <PERSON>Judge Mayer</PERSON> says, adding that "it's the responsibility of highly paid lawyers (who argue before the court) to make us understand (complex patent litigation)." 
<ORGANIZATION>Medtronic, Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the patent infringement case the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> this month agreed to review, as an example of poor legal reasoning by judges who lack patent litigation experience. (<PERSON>Judge Mayer</PERSON> was not on the three-member panel.) 
In the <LOCATION>Lilly</LOCATION> case, the appeals court broadly construed a federal statute to grant <PERSON>Medtronic</PERSON>, a medical device manufacturer, an exemption to infringe a patent under certain circumstances.
If the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> holds in <PERSON>Medtronic</PERSON>'s favor, the decision will have billion-dollar consequences for the manufacturers of medical devices, color and food additives and all other non-drug products that required <ORGANIZATION>Food & Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION> approval. 
<PERSON>Lisa Raines</PERSON>, a lawyer and director of government relations for the <ORGANIZATION>Industrial Biotechnical Association</ORGANIZATION>, contends that a judge well-versed in patent law and the concerns of research-based industries would have ruled otherwise.
<ORGANIZATION>DPC Acquisition Partners</ORGANIZATION>, a hostile suitor for <ORGANIZATION>Dataproducts Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, filed a petition in federal district court in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> seeking to have its standstill agreement with the computer printer maker declared void, and it proceeded with a $10-a-share tender offer for the company. 
<ORGANIZATION>DPC</ORGANIZATION> holds about 7.8% of <ORGANIZATION>Dataproducts</ORGANIZATION>' shares. 
<PERSON>Jack Davis</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Dataproducts</ORGANIZATION>' chairman, said he hadn't yet seen the filing and couldn't comment. 
<ORGANIZATION>DPC</ORGANIZATION> made a $15-a-share bid for the company in May, but <ORGANIZATION>Dataproducts</ORGANIZATION> management considered the $283.7 million proposal unacceptable.
While Wall Street's tough times and lower <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> interest rates continue to undermine the dollar, weakness in the pound and the yen is expected to offset those factors. "By default," the dollar probably will be able to hold up pretty well in coming days, says <PERSON>Francoise Soares-Kemp</PERSON>, a foreign-exchange adviser at <ORGANIZATION>Credit Suisse</ORGANIZATION>. "We're close to the bottom" of the near-term ranges, she contends. 
In <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Monday, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> currency opened for trading at 141.70 yen, down from Friday's <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> close of 142.75 yen. 
The dollar began Friday on a firm note, gaining against all major currencies in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> dealings and early <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> trading despite reports that the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Japan</ORGANIZATION> was seen unloading dollars around 142.70 yen.
But once the pound steadied with help from purchases by the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of England</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Bank of New York</ORGANIZATION>, the dollar was dragged down, traders say, by the stock-market slump that left the Dow Jones Industrial Average with a loss of 17.01 points. 
With the stock market wobbly and dollar buyers discouraged by signs of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economic weakness and the recent decline in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> interest rates that has diminished the attractiveness of dollar-denominated investments, traders say the dollar is still in a precarious position. "They'll be looking at levels to sell the dollar," says <PERSON>James Scalfaro</PERSON>, a foreign-exchange marketing representative at <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Montreal</ORGANIZATION>. 
With the pound and the yen lagging behind other major currencies, "you don't have a confirmation" that a sharp dollar downturn is in the works, says <PERSON>Mike Malpede</PERSON>, senior currency analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Refco Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. 
Although the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of England</ORGANIZATION>'s tight monetary policy has fueled worries that <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s slowing economy is headed for a recession, it is widely believed that <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>'s willingness to prop up the pound with interest-rate increases helped stem pound selling in recent weeks.
"It's fair to say there are more risks for the pound under Major than there were under <PERSON>Lawson</PERSON>," says <PERSON>Malcolm Roberts</PERSON>, a director of international bond market research at <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. 
"There's very little upside to sterling," <PERSON>Mr. Roberts</PERSON> says, but he adds that near-term losses may be small because the selling wave that followed <PERSON>Mr. Major</PERSON>'s appointment apparently has run its course. 
The pound likely will fall in coming days and may trade as low as 2.60 marks within the next year, says <PERSON>Nigel Rendell</PERSON>, an international economist at <ORGANIZATION>James Capel & Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
If the pound falls closer to 2.80 marks, the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of England</ORGANIZATION> may raise <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s base lending rate by one percentage point to 16%, says <PERSON>Mr. Rendell</PERSON>.
The dollar has a "natural base of support" around 140 yen because the Japanese currency hasn't been purchased heavily in recent weeks, says <PERSON>Ms. Soares-Kemp</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Credit Suisse</ORGANIZATION>.
Under the accord, <ORGANIZATION>Finnair</ORGANIZATION> agreed to coordinate flights, marketing and other functions with <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>, the 50%-state-owned airline of <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>.
The pact also calls for coordination between Finnair and <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>'s national carrier, <LOCATION>Swissair</LOCATION>, with which <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> entered a similar alliance last month. 
The <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> network canceled its first new series of the fall TV season, killing <PERSON>Mel Brooks</PERSON>'s wacky hotel comedy "The <ORGANIZATION>Nutt House</ORGANIZATION>." 
Last week <ORGANIZATION>CBS Inc.</ORGANIZATION> canceled "The People Next Door." <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s comedy had aired Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m. and in five outings had drawn an average of only 13.2% of homes, lagging behind the <PERSON>Jamie Lee Curtis</PERSON> comedy "Anything But Love" on <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>'s one-hour drama "Jake and the Fatman." <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION>, hasn't decided on a permanent replacement for the canceled series. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> said it won't be able to honor reinvestment requests from holders of bills maturing Nov. 2 held in the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>'s book-entry system.
In May 1988, an ammonium perchlorate plant in <LOCATION>Henderson</LOCATION> owned by an <ORGANIZATION>American Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> unit was leveled by a series of explosions.
After the explosion, <ORGANIZATION>Kerr-McGee</ORGANIZATION> temporarily shut down its facility just south of <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> for a safety inspection.
<ORGANIZATION>American Pacific</ORGANIZATION> and Kerr-McGee are the only two <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> manufacturers of ammonium perchlorate. 
<PERSON>Kerr-McGee</PERSON> said it has purchased 3,350 acres from the federal government in <LOCATION>Clark County</LOCATION> and plans to begin construction early next year.
<ORGANIZATION>American Pioneer</ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION>American Pioneer Savings Bank</ORGANIZATION>, said the sale will add capital and reduce the level of investments in subsidiaries for the thrift holding company. 
The transaction is subject to execution of a definitive purchase agreement and approval by various regulatory agencies, including the insurance departments of the states of <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, the company said. 
The <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>'s consumer price index rose a provisional 0.6% in September from August and was up 5.3% from September 1988, according to Eurostat, the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>'s statistical agency. 
<PERSON>Mr. Wilkinson</PERSON>, 45 years old, succeeds <PERSON>Thomas A. Bullock</PERSON>, 66, who is retiring as chairman but will continue as a director and chairman of the executive committee. 
But the <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, facility wasn't to begin turning out product until 1993, so the decision may reveal a more pessimistic long-term outlook as well. 
<PERSON>Kellogg</PERSON>, which hasn't been as successful in capitalizing on the public's health-oriented desire for oat bran as rival <ORGANIZATION>General Mills Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, has been losing share in the $6 billion ready-to-eat cereal market.
<PERSON>Kellogg</PERSON>'s current share is believed to be slightly under 40% while <ORGANIZATION>General Mills</ORGANIZATION>' share is about 27%. 
Led by its oat-based <ORGANIZATION>Cheerios</ORGANIZATION> line, <ORGANIZATION>General Mills</ORGANIZATION> has gained an estimated 2% share so far this year, mostly at the expense of <LOCATION>Kellogg</LOCATION>.
Analysts say much of <PERSON>Kellogg</PERSON>'s erosion has been in such core brands as Corn Flakes, <PERSON>Rice Krispies</PERSON> and <PERSON>Frosted Flakes</PERSON>, which represent nearly one-third of its sales volume.
"Cheerios and <ORGANIZATION>Honey Nut Cheerios</ORGANIZATION> have eaten away sales normally going to <PERSON>Kellogg</PERSON>'s corn-based lines simply because they are made of oats," says <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION> food analyst <PERSON>William Maguire</PERSON>. "They are not a happy group of people at <ORGANIZATION>Battle Creek</ORGANIZATION> right now." <PERSON>Kellogg</PERSON> is based in <LOCATION>Battle Creek</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, a city that calls itself the breakfast capital of the world. 
Another analyst, <PERSON>John C. Maxwell Jr.</PERSON> of Wheat, <ORGANIZATION>First Securities</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, recently went to a "sell" recommendation on <LOCATION>Kellogg</LOCATION> stock, which closed Friday at $71.75, down 75 cents, in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading. "I don't think <PERSON>Kellogg</PERSON> can get back to 40% this year," he said. "<PERSON>Kellogg</PERSON>'s main problem is life style.
People are reading the boxes and deciding they want something that's `healthy' for you -- oats, bran." <PERSON>Mr. Maxwell</PERSON> said he wouldn't be surprised if, over the next two years or so, <ORGANIZATION>General Mills</ORGANIZATION>' share increased to 30% or more. 
In announcing the plant delay, <ORGANIZATION>Kellogg</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>William E. LaMothe</PERSON> said, "Cereal volume growth in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> has not met our expectations for 1989." He said construction wouldn't resume until market conditions warrant it. 
A large plant in <LOCATION>Covington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, is to come on line next year. 
The company had retained the <ORGANIZATION>Fluor Daniel</ORGANIZATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION>Fluor Corp.</ORGANIZATION> as general contractor. 
Although he called current market conditions "highly competitive," <PERSON>Mr. LaMothe</PERSON>, <PERSON>Kellogg</PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive officer, forecast an earnings increase for the full year.
<ORGANIZATION>Rally's Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it filed suit in <ORGANIZATION>U.S. District Court</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION> against a group led by <PERSON>Burt Sugarman</PERSON>, seeking to block the investors from buying more shares. 
<ORGANIZATION>Rally's</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>, fast-food chain, alleges that the three investors, who are directors of the company, broke securities laws because they didn't disclose their intentions to acquire a big <ORGANIZATION>Rally</ORGANIZATION>'s stake. 
The group, led by <ORGANIZATION>Giant Group Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and its chairman, <PERSON>Mr. Sugarman</PERSON>, owns about 45.2% of <ORGANIZATION>Rally's</ORGANIZATION>.
In the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> filings, the group has said it may seek control of <ORGANIZATION>Rally's</ORGANIZATION>. 
He asserts that some directors, who have joined forces with company founder <PERSON>James Patterson</PERSON>, have ties to <ORGANIZATION>Wendy's</ORGANIZATION>, a competing hamburger chain.
The <ORGANIZATION>Patterson</ORGANIZATION> group, which controls about 42% of <ORGANIZATION>Rally</ORGANIZATION>'s shares, also may seek control. 
The banking company said it reached an agreement in principle with <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION> on a systems operations contract calling for <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> to operate <ORGANIZATION>First Tennessee</ORGANIZATION>'s computer and telecommunications functions. 
"Because personal computers will soon be on the desks of all of our tellers, and customer service and loan representatives, information will be instantly available to help customers with product decisions and provide them with information about their accounts," according to <PERSON>John Kelley</PERSON>, executive vice president and corporate services group manager at <ORGANIZATION>First Tennessee</ORGANIZATION>. 
<LOCATION>First Tennessee</LOCATION>, assisted by <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>, said it will attempt to place the employees within the company, <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> or other companies in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>.
FOREIGN PRIME RATES: <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> 13.50%; <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> 9%; <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> 4.875%; <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> 8.50%; <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> 15%.
<ORGANIZATION>FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORP.</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Freddie Mac</ORGANIZATION>): Posted yields on 30-year mortgage commitments for delivery within 30 days. 9.80%, standard conventional fixed-rate mortgages; 7.875%, 2% rate capped one-year adjustable rate mortgages.
<ORGANIZATION>FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Fannie Mae</ORGANIZATION>): Posted yields on 30 year mortgage commitments for delivery within 30 days (priced at par) 9.75%, standard conventional fixed-rate mortgages; 8.70%, 6/2 rate capped one-year adjustable rate mortgages.
Merger and acquisition activity in the third quarter exceeded the year-earlier pace, said <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>W.T. Grimm & Co.</ORGANIZATION> unit in <LOCATION>Schaumburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill</LOCATION>. 
Federal investigators have identified the problem in last July's crash of a <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION> flight in <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>: a structural flaw that developed during the making of a titanium engine disk. 
For several months, officials at the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Aviation Administration</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>National Transportation Safety Board</ORGANIZATION> have suspected that a metallurgical flaw in the disk led to a crack that ultimately caused the tail engine to break apart in flight.
But investigators could confirm their theory only after the recent retrieval of a big chunk of Flight 232's tail engine from a cornfield near the <LOCATION>Sioux City Airport</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>.
Among the issues the board will examine is whether <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, should have been able to detect the cracks through maintenance checks.
<PERSON>Anthony Broderick</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>FAA</ORGANIZATION>'s acting executive director for regulatory standards and compliance, said that recent tests of the failed engine disk indicate that a flaw -- known as "hard alpha" -- occurred in the titanium during its production almost 20 years ago.
Such tests make the <ORGANIZATION>FAA</ORGANIZATION> confident that a Sioux City-type accident "won't happen again," said <PERSON>Mr. Broderick</PERSON>.
A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION> said that the company has been working with the <ORGANIZATION>FAA</ORGANIZATION> all along on this issue and "will comply fully with the required inspections." But he also pointed out that the recalls will have no impact on <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION>'s engine production.
<ORGANIZATION>Shiseido Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s leading cosmetics producer, said it had net income of 5.64 billion yen ($39.7 million) in its first half, which ended Sept. 30. 
The estimated earthquake losses are low compared with the $4 billion in claims that insurers face from Hurricane Hugo, which ripped through the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Carolinas</LOCATION> last month.
However, insurance brokers and executives say that the combination of the Bay area earthquake, <PERSON>Hugo</PERSON> and last week's explosion at the <ORGANIZATION>Phillips Petroleum Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's refinery in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, will cause property insurance and reinsurance rates to jump. 
Other insurance rates such as casualty insurance, which would cover liability claims, aren't likely to firm right away, says <PERSON>Alice Cornish</PERSON>, an industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Northington Research</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Avon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn</LOCATION>.
Property reinsurance rates are likely to climb first, analysts and brokers believe. "The reinsurance market has been bloodied by disasters" in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> as well as in <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, says <PERSON>Thomas Rosencrants</PERSON>, director of research at <ORGANIZATION>Interstate/Johnson Lane Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>. 
Insurers, such as <ORGANIZATION>Cigna Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Transamerica Corp</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Aetna Life & Casualty Co.</ORGANIZATION>, buy reinsurance from other U.S.-based companies and <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's of London</ORGANIZATION> for one catastrophe at a time. 
After the earthquake two weeks ago, brokers say companies scrambled to replace reinsurance coverages again and <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> syndicates turned to the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> market excess lines for protection of their own. 
<PERSON>James Snedeker</PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Gill & Roeser Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based reinsurance broker, says insurers who took big losses this fall and had purchased little reinsurance in recent years will be asked to pay some pretty hefty rates if they want to buy reinsurance for 1990.
The $472 million of losses <ORGANIZATION>State Farm</ORGANIZATION> expects from <LOCATION>Hugo</LOCATION> and an additional $300 million from the earthquake are less than 5% of <ORGANIZATION>State Farm</ORGANIZATION>'s $16.7 billion total net worth. 
Since few insurers have announced what amount of losses they expect to see from the earthquake, it's impossible to get a clear picture of the quake's impact on fourth-quarter earnings, said <PERSON>Herbert Goodfriend</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Transamerica</ORGANIZATION> expects an after-tax charge of less than $3 million against fourth-quarter net; <ORGANIZATION>Hartford Insurance Group</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>ITT Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, expects a $15 million or 10 cents after-tax charge; and <ORGANIZATION>Fireman's Fund Corp.</ORGANIZATION> expects a charge of no more than $50 million before taxes and after using its reinsurance. 
Nicaraguan President <PERSON>Daniel Ortega</PERSON> may have accomplished over the weekend what his <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> antagonists have failed to do: revive a constituency for the <ORGANIZATION>Contra</ORGANIZATION> rebels. 
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON>George Mitchell</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>) said yesterday on <ORGANIZATION>NBC-TV</ORGANIZATION>'s "Meet the Press" that <PERSON>Mr. Ortega</PERSON>'s threat was "a very unwise move, particularly the timing of it." 
The threat came during a two-day celebration in <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> to highlight <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION>'s progress toward democracy in the region, attended by President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON>Brian Mulroney</PERSON> and 14 other <ORGANIZATION>Western Hemisphere</ORGANIZATION> leaders.
<PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> returned to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Saturday night. 
Not only did <PERSON>Mr. Ortega</PERSON>'s comments come in the midst of what was intended as a showcase for the region, it came as <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> is under special international scrutiny in anticipation of its planned February elections.
And important <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> lawmakers must decide at the end of November if the Contras are to receive the rest of the $49 million in so-called humanitarian assistance under a bipartisan agreement reached with the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration in March. 
The humanitarian assistance, which pays for supplies such as food and clothing for the rebels amassed along the Nicaraguan border with <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>, replaced the military aid cut off by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in February 1988.
While renewing military aid had been considered out of the question, rejected by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and de-emphasized by the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration, <PERSON>Mr. Ortega</PERSON>'s statement provides <ORGANIZATION>Contra</ORGANIZATION> supporters with the opportunity to press the administration on the issue. 
<PERSON>Mr. Ortega</PERSON>'s threat to breach the cease-fire comes as <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials were acknowledging that the Contras have at times violated it themselves.
Secretary of State <PERSON>James Baker</PERSON>, who accompanied President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>, told reporters Friday: "I have no reason to deny reports that some Contras ambushed some Sandinista soldiers." 
<PERSON>Mr. Baker</PERSON>'s assistant for inter-American affairs, <PERSON>Bernard Aronson</PERSON>, while maintaining that the Sandinistas had also broken the cease-fire, acknowledged: "It's never very clear who starts what." He added that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> has cut off aid to some rebel units when it was determined that those units broke the cease-fire. 
In addition to undermining arguments in favor of ending Contra aid, <PERSON>Mr. Ortega</PERSON>'s remarks also played to the suspicions of some <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials and conservatives outside the government that he is searching for ways to manipulate or void the February elections. 
Administration officials traveling with President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> interpreted <PERSON>Mr. Ortega</PERSON>'s wavering as a sign that he isn't responding to the military attacks so much as he is searching for ways to strengthen his hand prior to the elections.
<PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> said that <PERSON>Mr. Ortega</PERSON> is seeking to demobilize the Contras prior to the elections to remove any pressure to hold fair elections. 
"The employment report is going to be difficult to interpret," said <PERSON>Michael Englund</PERSON>, economist with <ORGANIZATION>MMS International</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>McGraw-Hill Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Englund</PERSON> added that next month's data isn't likely to be much better, because it will be distorted by <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s earthquake.
<PERSON>Samuel D. Kahan</PERSON>, chief financial economist at <ORGANIZATION>Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, said that the purchasers' report is valuable because it often presents the first inkling of economic data for the month.
<PERSON>David Wyss</PERSON>, chief financial economist at <ORGANIZATION>Data Resources Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, said that the purchasers' index "does miss occasionally," adding: "When it misses one month it tends to miss the next month, too." 
<ORGANIZATION>Data Resources</ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON>Mr. Wyss</PERSON> added that he will be keeping a closer eye than ususal on October chain-store sales.
ABB <PERSON>Asea Brown Boveri B.V.</PERSON> said it signed a contract for the largest-ever power plant order in the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>ABB</ORGANIZATION> said the contract, signed with the <LOCATION>Dutch</LOCATION> utility <ORGANIZATION>N.V. Energieproduktiebedrijf UNA</ORGANIZATION>, is valued in excess of $200 million.
The accord is for a turbogenerator plant at the coal-fired power station <LOCATION>Hemweg</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>ABB Asea Brown Boveri</ORGANIZATION> is the Dutch unit of the Swedish-Swiss electrical engineering group <ORGANIZATION>ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG</ORGANIZATION>. 
The Dutch utility firm serves the <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Utrecht</ORGANIZATION> areas.
They also approved the relocation of the company's registered office to <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION> and a name change to <ORGANIZATION>NHI Nelson Holdings International Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 
Following the consolidation, the entertainment company, which has film and television operations in <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, will have about 4.1 million shares outstanding.
<LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s trade deficit narrowed to 2.007 trillion lire ($1.49 billion) in September from 2.616 trillion lire a year earlier, the state statistical office <ORGANIZATION>Istat</ORGANIZATION> said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it applied to Taiwanese securities officials for permission to open brokerage offices in <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>'s application is the first since the <ORGANIZATION>Taiwan Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> announced June 21 that it would allow foreign brokerage firms to do business in that country.
<LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> officials are expected to review the <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> application later this year. 
"Put your money in a good utility or bank stock, not a paper company," advises <PERSON>George Adler</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Smith Barney</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Robert Schneider</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Duff & Phelps</ORGANIZATION> sees paper-company stock prices falling 10% to 15% in 1990, perhaps 25% if there's a recession. 
Last week <PERSON>Mr. Adler</PERSON> lowered his rating from hold to "avoid" on <ORGANIZATION>Boise Cascade</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Champion International</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Great Northern Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>International Paper</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana Pacific</LOCATION> and Weyerhaeuser.
Oppenheimer's <PERSON>Mr. Palmero</PERSON>, meanwhile, is steering clear of <ORGANIZATION>Gaylord Container</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Stone Container</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Federal Paper Board</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Schneider</PERSON> is cool to <LOCATION>Georgia Pacific</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Abitibi-Price</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Great Northern Nekoosa</ORGANIZATION> said, "The odds of the dire predictions about us being right are small." <ORGANIZATION>International Paper</ORGANIZATION> emphasizes that it is better positioned than most companies for the coming overcapacity because its individual mills can make more than one grade of paper. 
A <ORGANIZATION>Boise-Cascade</ORGANIZATION> spokesman referred to a speech by Chairman <PERSON>John Fery</PERSON>, in which he said that markets generally are stable, although some risk of further price deterioration exists. 
<ORGANIZATION>Stone Container</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Roger Stone</PERSON> said that, unlike for some other paper products, demand for Stone's principal commodity, unbleached containerboard, remains strong.
<LOCATION>Louisiana Pacific</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Pacific</ORGANIZATION> said a number of other analysts are recommending them because of their strong wood-products business. 
Because the stock prices of some paper companies already reflect an expected profit slump, <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Ross</PERSON> says he thinks that next year the share prices of some companies may fall at most only 5% to 10%.
<PERSON>Mr. Palmero</PERSON> recommends <LOCATION>Temple-Inland</LOCATION>, explaining that it is "virtually the sole major paper company not undergoing a major capacity expansion," and thus should be able to lower long-term debt substantially next year. 
Analysts agree that the price drop should especially benefit the two big tissue makers, <PERSON>Scott Paper</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kimberly-Clark</PERSON>.
<ORGANIZATION>Jim Pattison Industries Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, one of a group of closely held companies owned by entrepreneur <PERSON>James Pattison</PERSON>, said it "intends to seek control" of 30%-owned <ORGANIZATION>Innopac Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> packaging concern. 
<PERSON>Martin Fabi</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Innopac</ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive, said <ORGANIZATION>Innopac</ORGANIZATION> viewed <PERSON>Mr. Pattison</PERSON>'s decision to seek control as a "very positive" move. "I'm happy that he feels positively about our company," he said.
<PERSON>Mr. Fabi</PERSON> wouldn't say directly whether <PERSON>Mr. Pattison</PERSON> has disclosed potential terms for his planned bid for control. 
Among other things, <ORGANIZATION>Innopac</ORGANIZATION> is involved in recycling polystyrene foam products that are often used by fast food chains, such as <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, for food packaging.
A joint venture involving units of <ORGANIZATION>Innopac</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mobil Corp.</ORGANIZATION> earlier this year opened the first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> polystyrene recycling plant, in <LOCATION>Leominster</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>. 
Bowing to criticism, <PERSON>Bear Stearns</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley</ORGANIZATION> and Oppenheimer joined <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION> in suspending stock-index arbitrage trading for their own accounts.
<ORGANIZATION>LIN Broadcasting</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth</ORGANIZATION> sweetened their plan to merge cellular phone operations, offering <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> holders a special $42-a-share payout.
<ORGANIZATION>RJR Nabisco</ORGANIZATION> agreed to sell three candy businesses to <LOCATION>Nestle</LOCATION> for $370 million.
The accord helps <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION> pay off debt and boosts <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION>'s 7% share of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> candy market to 12%. 
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> are expected to go head to head in the markets to buy up rival 15% stakes in <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> confirmed it received <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> antitrust clearance to boost its holding. 
<ORGANIZATION>Sansui Electric</ORGANIZATION> agreed to sell a 51% stake to <ORGANIZATION>Polly Peck</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> for $110 million.
<LOCATION>Nashua</LOCATION> strengthened its poison-pill plan after announcing a Dutch firm is seeking to buy up to 25% of the <ORGANIZATION>New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION> copier company. 
<ORGANIZATION>Mobil</ORGANIZATION> is cutting back its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> oil and gas exploration and production group by up to 15% as part of a restructuring of the business. 
<PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON> sold <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> on the idea of the decimal system for currency, thus saving Americans the headaches of pounds, shillings and pence.
In 1807, the <LOCATION>Swiss</LOCATION> mathematician who headed the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Coast</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Geodetic</ORGANIZATION> Survey made an "iron meter" that he had brought from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> the standard of measure.
<ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION>, for example, uses metric terms for its automobile bodies and power trains. (In auto advertising, however, items such as wheelbases are still described in inches.) Farm-machine makers such as <ORGANIZATION>Caterpillar</ORGANIZATION> and Deere work in the metric system.
New weapons systems will be around until the next century, notes <PERSON>John Tascher</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION>'s metric coordinator. 
Still, like the auto makers, when dealing with <PERSON>Mr. Everyman</PERSON> the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> sticks to the tried and true.
<ORGANIZATION>Nissan Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> expects net income to reach 120 billion yen (<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> $857 million) in its current fiscal year, up from 114.6 billion yen in the previous year, <PERSON>Yutaka Kume</PERSON>, president, said. 
<PERSON>Mr. Kume</PERSON> made the earnings projection for fiscal 1990, ending next March 31, in an interview with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> automotive writers attending the <LOCATION>Tokyo Motor Show</LOCATION>. 
The executive said that the anticipated earnings increase is fairly modest because <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> is spending heavily to bolster its dealership network in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and because of currency-exchange fluctuations. 
During the next decade, <PERSON>Mr. Kume</PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> plans to boost overseas vehicle production sufficiently to account for a majority of sales outside <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
Last year, <PERSON>Mr. Kume</PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> exported slightly over one million vehicles, and produced 570,000 cars and trucks at its factories in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
But by 1992, he added, <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> will build one million vehicles a year outside <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, or sufficient to equal exports. 
Not so fast, says Rep. <PERSON>Mickey Edwards</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, a fellow Republican. "I consider it one of the stupidest ideas of the 20th century," he says. 
Now the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> is declaring that he might not rely on <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> -- which hasn't shown any willingness to surrender such authority -- to pass the line-item veto law he seeks.
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spokesmen last week said <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> is considering simply declaring that the Constitution gives him the power, exercising a line-item veto and inviting a court challenge to decide whether he has the right. 
Although that may sound like an arcane maneuver of little interest outside <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, it would set off a political earthquake. "The ramifications are enormous," says Rep. <PERSON>Don Edwards</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Democrat who is a senior member of the <ORGANIZATION>House Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION>. "It's a real face-to-face arm wrestling challenge to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>." 
Some senior advisers argue that with further fights over a capital-gains tax cut and a budget-reduction bill looming, <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> already has enough pending confrontations with <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
The issue arose last week when Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> told an audience in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> that <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> was looking for a test case.
White House Press Secretary <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON> confirmed that <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> was interested in the idea, but cautioned that there wasn't a firm decision to try it. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>, former President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> and a host of conservative activists have been arguing that a line-item veto would go a long way in restoring discipline to the budget process.
They base their argument on a clause buried in Article I, Section 7, of the Constitution that states: "Every order, resolution, or vote to which the concurrence of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> may be necessary (except on a question of adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>; and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved by him or . . . disapproved by him. . . ." 
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON>Robert Dole</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Kan.</LOCATION>), for one, accepts this argument and earlier this year publicly urged <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> "to use the line-item veto and allow the courts to decide whether or not it is constitutional." 
There's little doubt that such a move would be immediately challenged in court -- and that it would quickly make its way to the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> to be ultimately resolved. "It's a major issue, and they wouldn't want to leave it at a lower level," says <PERSON>Stephen Glazier</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> attorney whose writings have been instrumental in pushing the idea that a president already has a line-item veto. 
Rep. <PERSON>Edwards</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Democrat, is one who pledges that he would immediately challenge <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> in the courts, arguing a line-item veto would expand a president's powers far beyond anything the framers of the Constitution had in mind. "It puts this president in the legislative business," he declares. "That's not what our fathers had in mind." 
He notes that, as a lawmaker from the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> area, he fights each year to preserve federal funds for the <ORGANIZATION>Bay Area Rapid Transit</ORGANIZATION> system.
If a president had a line-item veto and wanted to force him to support a controversial foreign-policy initiative, Rep. <PERSON>Edwards</PERSON> says, the president could call and declare that he would single-handedly kill the <ORGANIZATION>BART</ORGANIZATION> funds unless the congressman "shapes up" on the foreign-policy issue. 
Big chunks of the government budget, like the entitlement programs of <ORGANIZATION>Social Security</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Medicare</ORGANIZATION>, wouldn't be affected.
Whatever the outcome of a test case, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> would have to move cautiously becase the very attempt would "antagonize not just Democrats but Republicans," says <PERSON>Louis Fisher</PERSON>, a scholar at the <ORGANIZATION>Congressional Research Service</ORGANIZATION> who specializes in executive-legislative relations.
Indeed, although a majority of <ORGANIZATION>Republican</ORGANIZATION> lawmakers favor a line-item veto, some, ranging from liberal Oregon <PERSON>Sen. Mark Hatfield</PERSON> to conservative Rep. <PERSON>Edwards</PERSON> are opposed.
"Every order, resolution, or vote to which the concurrence of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> may be necessary (except on a question of adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>; and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two-thirds of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION>, according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill." 
<ORGANIZATION>CNW Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said the final step in the acquisition of the company has been completed with the merger of <ORGANIZATION>CNW</ORGANIZATION> with a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Chicago & North Western Holdings Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
As reported, <ORGANIZATION>CNW</ORGANIZATION> agreed to be acquired by a group of investors led by <ORGANIZATION>Blackstone Capital Partners Limited Partnership</ORGANIZATION> for $50 a share, or about $950 million. 
The next time you hear a Member of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> moan about the deficit, consider what <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> did Friday.
The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, 84-6, voted to increase to $124,000 the ceiling on insured mortgages from the <ORGANIZATION>FHA</ORGANIZATION>, which lost $4.2 billion in loan defaults last year. 
Then, by voice vote, the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> voted a pork-barrel bill, approved Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, for domestic military construction.
For construction in <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> requested $4.5 million; <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> gave Senator Byrd's state $21.5 million.
Senator <PERSON>Byrd</PERSON> is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Appropriations Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
For <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, a $1.8 million request became $12 million for Senator <PERSON>Grassley</PERSON>, ranking minority member of a military construction subcommittee.
Rep. <PERSON>Jamie Whitten</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> and chairman of <ORGANIZATION>House Appropriations</ORGANIZATION> turned a $20 million <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> request for his state into a $49.7 million bequest.
Senator <PERSON>Sasser</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> is chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee on military construction; <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>'s $87 million request for <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> increased to $109 million.
<ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> are now going head to head in the markets for shares of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar PLC</ORGANIZATION>, as <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> got early clearance from the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Trade Commission</ORGANIZATION> to boost its stake in the British luxury car maker. 
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> confirmed Friday that it received permission late Thursday from <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> antitrust regulators to increase its <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> holdings past the $15 million level.
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> got a similar go-ahead earlier in October, and on Friday, <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> announced that the No. 2 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auto maker had raised its stake to 13.2%, or 24.2 million shares, from 12.4% earlier in the week. 
A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>, the No. 1 auto maker, declined to say how many <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shares that company owns.
In late trading Friday, <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shares bucked the downward tide in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s stock market and rose five pence to 725 pence ($11.44).
In the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s American depositary receipts were among the most active issues Friday in national over-the-counter trading where they closed at $11.625 each, up 62.5 cents. 
Analysts expect that the two <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auto giants will move quickly to buy up 15% stakes in <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, setting up a potential bidding war for the prestigious <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> brand. 
The <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> government, which owned <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> until 1984, still holds a controlling "golden share" in the company. 
With the golden share as protection, <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> officials have rebuffed <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s overtures, and moved instead to forge an alliance with <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> officials have indicated they are close to wrapping up a friendly alliance with <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> that would preserve <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s independence, but no deal has been announced.
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>, on the other hand, has said it's willing to bid for all of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, despite the objections of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> chairman Sir <PERSON>John Egan</PERSON>.
Analysts continued to speculate late last week that <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> may try to force the issue by calling for a special shareholder's meeting and urging that the government and <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> holders remove the barriers to a full bidding contest before December 1990.
But a <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION>Dearborn</LOCATION> said Friday the company hasn't requested such a meeting yet. 
Individuals close to the situation believe <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> officials will seek a meeting this week with Sir <PERSON>John</PERSON> to outline their proposal for a full bid.
Any discussions with <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> could postpone the <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar-GM</ORGANIZATION> deal, headed for completion within the next two weeks.
The <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> agreement is expected to retain <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s independence by involving an eventual 30% stake for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auto giant as well as joint manufacturing and marketing ventures. 
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> hope to win <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shareholders approval for the accord partly by structuring it in a way that wouldn't preclude a full <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> bid once the golden share expires. "There's either a minority {stake} package capable of getting <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shareholder approval or there isn't," said one knowledgeable individual. "If there isn't, {the deal} won't be put forward" to shareholders. 
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> unit holds crucial talks today with union officials about its consideration of an Ellesmere Port site for its first major engine plant in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
One auto-industry union leader said, "If they try to build it somewhere else {in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>} besides the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION>, they are going to be in big trouble" with unionists over any <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> deal. 
In <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION> stock market circles, the buzzword is "mega." At least 40 companies are coming to the capital market to raise $6 billion, an amount never thought possible in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. 
"When they talk mega-issues, they're truly talking mega," says <PERSON>S.A. Dave</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Board of India</ORGANIZATION>. "The capital market is booming." 
Some analysts are concerned that the mega-issues, in such an unregulated environment, could lead to a mega-crash. "The rate of failures will be much more than the rate of successes in the mega-projects," says <PERSON>G.S. Patel</PERSON>, a former chairman of the giant, government-run mutual fund, the Unit Trust of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. "They're going to have mega-problems." 
This year's biggest issue, $570 million of convertible debentures by engineering company <ORGANIZATION>Larsen & Toubro Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, is the largest in <LOCATION>Indian</LOCATION> history.
<PERSON>Mr. Gandhi</PERSON> has called general elections for November, and many businessmen fear that he and his <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> (I) Party will lose.
Still to come are big issues by <ORGANIZATION>Bindal Agro Chem Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a petrochemical and agrochemical company, and <ORGANIZATION>Usha Rectifier Corp.</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>), a semiconductor maker.
"I don't think it will lead to any chaos in the secondary market," says <PERSON>Mr. Patel</PERSON>, "only a sagging tendency." Says <PERSON>M.J. Pherwani</PERSON>, chairman of the Unit Trust of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>: The "markets are headed for growth unheard of and unseen before." 
The <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Board of India</ORGANIZATION> was set up earlier this year, along the lines of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>, but <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> hasn't pushed the legislation to make it operational.
Although <ORGANIZATION>Larsen & Toubro</ORGANIZATION> hadn't raised money from the public in 38 years, its new owners frequently raise funds on the local market. (<ORGANIZATION>Reliance</ORGANIZATION> floated a $357 million petrochemical company in 1988 that was, at the time, the largest public issue in Indian history.) The media has raised questions about <ORGANIZATION>Larsen & Toubro</ORGANIZATION>'s issue, pointing out that it exceeds the company's annual sales and its market capitalization. 
<LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>USI Far East Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a petrochemical company, initialed the agreement with an unidentified Japanese contractor to build a naphtha cracker, according to <PERSON>Alson Lee</PERSON>, who heads the <LOCATION>Philippine</LOCATION> company set up to build and operate the complex.
<PERSON>Mr. Lee</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Luzon Petrochemical Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said the contract was signed Wednesday in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> with <LOCATION>USI Far East</LOCATION> officials.
The complex is to be located in <LOCATION>Batangas</LOCATION>, about 70 miles south of <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>USI Far East</ORGANIZATION> will hold a 60% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Luzon Petrochemical</ORGANIZATION>, according to papers signed with the <LOCATION>Philippine</LOCATION> government's <ORGANIZATION>Board of Investments</ORGANIZATION>. 
At an estimated $360 million, the project would represent the single largest foreign investment in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> since President <PERSON>Corazon Aquino</PERSON> took office in February 1986.
As previously reported, a member of the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> has sued to stop the plant.
The legislator, <PERSON>Enrique Garcia</PERSON>, had actively backed the plant, but at the original site in his constituency northwest of <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>.
The country's <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> dismissed the suit, but <PERSON>Mr. Garcia</PERSON> late last month filed for a reconsideration. 
However, at a news conference Thursday, <PERSON>Mrs. Aquino</PERSON> backed the project and said her government was attempting to soothe the feelings of residents at the original site, adjacent to the government's major petroleum refinery in <LOCATION>Bataan</LOCATION> province. "We have tried our best to tell the people in <LOCATION>Bataan</LOCATION> that maybe this time it will not go to them, but certainly we will do our best to encourage other investors to go to their province," <PERSON>Mrs. Aquino</PERSON> told Manila-based foreign correspondents. 
<ORGANIZATION>China General Plastics</ORGANIZATION>, another Taiwanese petrochemical manufacturer, was to have a 40% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Luzon Petrochemical</ORGANIZATION>. 
However, <PERSON>Mr. Lee</PERSON> said that <LOCATION>USI Far East</LOCATION> is confident other investors will take up the slack.
He said <LOCATION>USI Far East</LOCATION> has applied to both the <ORGANIZATION>Asian Development Bank</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>International Finance Corp.</ORGANIZATION> for financing that could include equity stakes. 
<ORGANIZATION>NBI Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said that it cannot pay the Oct. 31 dividend on its Series A convertible preferred stock, allowing the stock's holder to convert the shares into as much as 27.7% of <ORGANIZATION>NBI</ORGANIZATION>'s shares outstanding. 
Under terms of the stock, the <ORGANIZATION>Yukon ESOP</ORGANIZATION> can demand that the stock be redeemed for $4,090,000 on Nov. 30, but <ORGANIZATION>NBI</ORGANIZATION> said it is legally prohibited from making the redemption.
Failure to pay the dividend allows <LOCATION>Yukon</LOCATION> to convert all or some of its shares into <ORGANIZATION>NBI</ORGANIZATION> common after Nov. 30, at a conversion price based on <ORGANIZATION>NBI</ORGANIZATION>'s closing stock price. 
<ORGANIZATION>NBI</ORGANIZATION> also said it has hired <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ORGANIZATION> as its financial adviser and investment banker to help it restructure financially and improve its balance sheet. 
<ORGANIZATION>Exxon Corp.</ORGANIZATION> is resigning from the <ORGANIZATION>National Wildlife Federation</ORGANIZATION>'s corporate advisory panel, saying the conservation group has been unfairly critical of the <ORGANIZATION>Exxon Valdez</ORGANIZATION> oil spill along the <LOCATION>Alaskan</LOCATION> coast. 
<ORGANIZATION>Exxon</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Exxon USA</ORGANIZATION> unit was one of the charter members of the <ORGANIZATION>Corporate Conservation Council</ORGANIZATION>, a panel of executives formed in 1982 by the <ORGANIZATION>National Wildlife Federation</ORGANIZATION> to foster "frank and open discussions" between industry and the federation's leaders. 
In a letter to the federation, <PERSON>Raymond Campion</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Exxon</ORGANIZATION>'s environmental coordinator, said: "Recent public actions by you regarding the <LOCATION>Valdez</LOCATION> oil spill have failed to demonstrate any sense of objectivity or fairness." 
We are deeply disturbed that a recent editorial stated that the "Americans With Disabilities Act of 1989" was "crafted primarily by <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Senators Kennedy</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Harkin</LOCATION>" with a premise "based on the presumption that most Americans are hostile to the disabled. . . ." Perhaps even more offensive is the statement, "It is surprising that <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> and the White House inner circle would ally themselves with this crabby philosophy." 
This legislation was not drafted by a handful of Democratic "do-gooders." Quite the contrary -- it results from years of work by members of the <ORGANIZATION>National Council</ORGANIZATION> on the Handicapped, all appointed by President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>.
As competition heats up in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s crowded bank market, <ORGANIZATION>Banco Exterior de Espana</ORGANIZATION> is seeking to shed its image of a state-owned bank and move into new activities. 
Under the direction of its new chairman, <PERSON>Francisco Luzon</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s seventh largest bank is undergoing a tough restructuring that analysts say may be the first step toward the bank's privatization. 
The state-owned industrial holding company <ORGANIZATION>Instituto Nacional de Industria</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of</ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> jointly hold a 13.94% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Banco Exterior</ORGANIZATION>.
If that proves true, analysts say <ORGANIZATION>Banco Exterior</ORGANIZATION> could be a prime partner -- or even a takeover target -- for either a <LOCATION>Spanish</LOCATION> or foreign bank seeking to increase its market share after 1992, when the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> plans to dismantle financial barriers. 
With 700 branches in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and 12 banking subsidiaries, five branches and 12 representative offices abroad, the <ORGANIZATION>Banco Exterior</ORGANIZATION> group has a lot to offer a potential suitor. 
Instead, they are working to transform <ORGANIZATION>Banco Exterior</ORGANIZATION> into an efficient bank by the end of 1992. "I want this to be a model of the way a public-owned company should be run," <PERSON>Mr. Luzon</PERSON> says. 
<ORGANIZATION>Banco Exterior</ORGANIZATION> was created in 1929 to provide subsidized credits for <LOCATION>Spanish</LOCATION> exports.
At the same time, many of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s traditional export markets in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> and other developing areas faced a sharp decline in economic growth. 
Until <PERSON>Mr. Luzon</PERSON> took the helm last November, <ORGANIZATION>Banco Exterior</ORGANIZATION> was run by politicians who lacked either the skills or the will to introduce innovative changes.
Though <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> has an excess of banks, analysts say the country still has one of the most profitable markets in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, which will aid <ORGANIZATION>Banco Exterior</ORGANIZATION> with the tough tasks it faces ahead. 
The bank says it's interested in purchasing banks in <LOCATION>Morocco</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Banco Exterior</ORGANIZATION> was one of the last banks to create a brokerage house before the four <LOCATION>Spanish</LOCATION> stock exchanges underwent sweeping changes in July.
But <PERSON>Mr. Luzon</PERSON> contends that the experienced team he brought with him from <PERSON>Banco Bilbao Vizcaya</PERSON>, where he was formerly director general, will whip the bank's capital market division into shape by the end of 1992.
The bank also says it'll use its international network to channel investment from <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> into the <LOCATION>Spanish</LOCATION> stock exchanges. 
Its relationship with parent <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> had been frayed since a big <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION> insider-trading scandal two years ago.
By the end of this year, 63-year-old Chairman <PERSON>Silas Cathcart</PERSON> -- the former chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Illinois Tool Works</ORGANIZATION> who was derided as a "tool-and-die man" when GE brought him in to clean up Kidder in 1987 -- retires to his <LOCATION>Lake Forest</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, home, possibly to build a shopping mall on some land he owns. "I've done what I came to do" at <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION>, he says. 
And that means 42-year-old <PERSON>Michael Carpenter</PERSON>, president and chief executive since January, will for the first time take complete control of <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION> and try to make good on some grandiose plans.
<PERSON>Mr. Carpenter</PERSON> says he will return <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION> to prominence as a great investment bank. 
Through the first nine months of the year, <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION> ranks a distant 10th among underwriters of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stocks and bonds, with a 2.8% market share, up slightly from 2.5% in the year-earlier period, according to <ORGANIZATION>Securities Data Co</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Gary S. Goldstein</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Whitney Group</ORGANIZATION>, an executive search firm, said: "I'd like to see (<ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION>) succeed.
In fact, <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION> is a minor player in just about every business it does except computer-driven program trading; in that controversial business, only <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley & Co.</ORGANIZATION> rivals <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Carpenter</PERSON>, a former consulting-firm executive who has a love for "task forces," says he has done a "complete rethink" of <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION> in recent months.
<PERSON>Mr. Carpenter</PERSON> says that when he assumes full control, <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION> will finally tap the resources of GE.
One of <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION>'s goals when it bought 80% of <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION> in 1986 was to take advantage of "syngeries" between <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION>'s corporate-finance unit, which has $42 billion in assets.
The leveraged buy-out group of <ORGANIZATION>GE Capital</ORGANIZATION> now reports to <PERSON>Mr. Carpenter</PERSON>. 
So far, instead of teaming up, <ORGANIZATION>GE Capital</ORGANIZATION> staffers and <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION> investment bankers have bickered.
Yet, says <PERSON>Mr. Carpenter</PERSON>, "We've really started to exploit the synergy between <ORGANIZATION>GE Capital</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Kidder Peabody</ORGANIZATION>." The units have worked on 37 investment banking deals this year, he says, though not all of them have panned out. 
A month ago, the firm started serving dinner at about 7:30 each night; about 50 to 60 of the 350 people in the investment banking operation have consistently been around that late. "We are working significantly longer and harder than has been the case in the past," says <PERSON>Scott C. Newquist</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION>'s head of investment banking since June. 
A new in-house magazine, <ORGANIZATION>Kidder World</ORGANIZATION> -- which will focus on the firm's synergy strategy, says <PERSON>Mr. Carpenter</PERSON> -- confides that on weekends <PERSON>Mr. Newquist</PERSON> "often gets value-added ideas while flying his single-engine <ORGANIZATION>Cessna Centurion</ORGANIZATION> on the way to <LOCATION>Nantucket</LOCATION>." 
The firm's new head of mergers and acquisitions under <PERSON>Mr. Newquist</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>B.J. Megargel</ORGANIZATION>, talks of the opportunity to "rebuild a franchise" at <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION>. "The <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION> name is one of only six or seven that every CEO recognizes as a viable alternative" when considering a merger deal, he says.
Now, according to a <ORGANIZATION>Kidder World</ORGANIZATION> story about <PERSON>Mr. Megargel</PERSON>, all the firm has to do is "position ourselves more in the deal flow." 
With investment banking as <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION>'s "lead business," where do <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION>'s 42-branch brokerage network and its 1,400 brokers fit in?
<PERSON>Mr. Carpenter</PERSON> this month sold off <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION>'s eight brokerage offices in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, refueling speculation that <PERSON>Kidder</PERSON> is getting out of the brokerage business entirely.
The result: <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION> will focus on rich individual investors and small companies, much closer to the clientele of <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ORGANIZATION> than a serve-the-world firm like <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Carpenter</PERSON> notes that these types of investors also are "sophisticated" enough not to complain about <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION>'s aggressive use of program trading. 
<ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION> competitors aren't outwardly hostile to the firm, as many are to a tough competitor like <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION> that doesn't have <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION>'s long history.
The departing <PERSON>Mr. Cathcart</PERSON> says he has no worries about <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION>'s future.
<PERSON>Mr. Cathcart</PERSON>, who will return to the <ORGANIZATION>Quaker Oats Co.</ORGANIZATION> board of directors, in addition to his personal ventures, is credited with bringing some basic budgeting and planning discipline to traditionally free-wheeling <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Cathcart</PERSON> says he has had "a lot of fun" at <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION>, adding the crack about his being a "tool-and-die man" never bothered him. "It was an absolutely marvelous line and one I used many times," he says. 
Smiling broadly when he talks about <PERSON>Mr. Carpenter</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Cathcart</PERSON> says the new <ORGANIZATION>Kidder</ORGANIZATION> chief is "going to be recognized shortly as one of the real leaders in the investment-banking business." In coming years, <PERSON>Mr. Cathcart</PERSON> says, <PERSON>Kidder</PERSON> is "gonna hum." 
<PERSON>Christopher Whittle</PERSON>, chairman of the <LOCATION>Knoxville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, media company that is 50% owned by <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said that by December 1990 he expects to have Channel One installed in about 8,000 schools with a potential audience of six million.
In <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, state officials have opposed Channel One.
The <ORGANIZATION>Educational Network</ORGANIZATION>, as <PERSON>Mr. Whittle</PERSON> has named the three programs, has been offered to 1,290 school districts and <LOCATION>Whittle</LOCATION> continues to negotiate with 919 districts.
<PERSON>John Bruner</PERSON>, associate director of communications for <ORGANIZATION>Cincinnati Public Schools</ORGANIZATION>, said Channel One was rejected because students watching the program didn't fare particularly better on a 28-question current events quiz than a control school without the program and school absences were almost unchanged during the period when the program was being aired. 
<PERSON>Dennis Farney</PERSON>'s Oct. 13 page-one article "River of Despair," about the poverty along the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, fanned childhood memories of when my parents were sharecroppers in southeastern <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, only a few miles from the river.
Farmers in the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> and other areas have suffered, but those along the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> continue to prosper with holdings that were built with the sweat of men and women living in economic slavery.
Does the <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> deserve government help in attracting industry when the majority of residents, <PERSON>black</PERSON> and white, do not realize racism alienates potential employers?
The next time expansion plans are mentioned at the old company and somebody says, "Aw heck, guys, nobody can do it like <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>," I wish you would butt in and say, "Hold it, fellas, why don't we compare prices and use our own little Third World country.
There is no mystery why the <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> originated "<PERSON>Singin</PERSON>' the Blues." 
<LOCATION>Hollandale</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Miss</LOCATION>. 
Nobody should have to live in such poor conditions as in "Sugar Ditch," but when you travel to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the same problems exist.
Then maybe I could stay home and have seven children and watch <PERSON>Oprah Winfrey</PERSON>, like <ORGANIZATION>Beulah</ORGANIZATION> in the article, instead of having one child and working constantly just to stay above water, like so many families in this country. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Treasury Department</ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade deficit may worsen next year, after two years of significant improvement. 
In its report to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> on international economic policies, the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> said that any improvement in the broadest measure of trade, known as the current account, "is likely at best to be very modest," and "the possibility of deterioration in the current account next year cannot be excluded." 
The statement was the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government's first acknowledgement of what other groups, such as the <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION>, have been predicting for months.
The <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>'s report, which is required annually by a provision of the 1988 trade act, again took <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> to task for its exchange-rate policies. "We believe that there have continued to be indications of exchange-rate `manipulation'" during the past six months, it said, citing the lack of market forces in <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>'s exchange-rate system and the use of capital and interest-rate controls to manipulate exchange rates. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> expressed pleasure, however, with the government of <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>, which was cited for exchange-rate manipulation in last year's report.
The <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> has liberalized its exchange rate system in the past year. 
<PERSON>Milton Petrie</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Petrie Stores Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said he has agreed to sell his 15.2% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Deb Shops Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Petrie Stores</ORGANIZATION>. 
In a <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> filing, <PERSON>Mr. Petrie</PERSON> said that on Oct. 26 <ORGANIZATION>Petrie Stores</ORGANIZATION> agreed to purchase <PERSON>Mr. Petrie</PERSON>'s 2,331,100 Deb Shops shares.
The filing said <ORGANIZATION>Petrie Stores</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Secaucus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, is purchasing <PERSON>Mr. Petrie</PERSON>'s Deb Shops stake as an investment.
Although <ORGANIZATION>Petrie Stores</ORGANIZATION> has considered seeking to acquire the remaining equity of <ORGANIZATION>Deb Stores</ORGANIZATION>, it has no current intention to pursue such a possibility, the filing said. 
Philadelphia-based <PERSON>Deb Shops</PERSON> said it saw little significance in <PERSON>Mr. Petrie</PERSON> selling his stock to <ORGANIZATION>Petrie Stores</ORGANIZATION>. "We didn't look at it and say, `Oh my God, something is going to happen, '" said <PERSON>Stanley Uhr</PERSON>, vice president and corporate counsel. 
<PERSON>Mr. Uhr</PERSON> said that <PERSON>Mr. Petrie</PERSON> or his company have been accumulating Deb Shops stock for several years, each time issuing a similar regulatory statement.
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>, a 62%-owned unit of <ORGANIZATION>American Express Co.</ORGANIZATION>, didn't have enough time to update its market commentary so, "We decided to kill our strategy pieces," says <PERSON>Jack Rivkin</PERSON>, the head of <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>'s research department. 
As <PERSON>Mr. Rivkin</PERSON> explains it, "We were raising some caution flags about rate rises in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and concerns about the LBO market.
<ORGANIZATION>British Airways PLC</ORGANIZATION>, a crucial participant in the proposed buy-out of <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, washed its hands of the current efforts to revive a bid for the parent of <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>. 
Specifically, the <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> carrier said it currently has no plans to participate in any new offer for <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>.
Company officials said later that <ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION> believes its involvement in the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> buy-out ended last Friday when the buy-out group, which also includes <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>'s management and pilot union, failed to obtain financing for the $6.79 billion transaction. 
However, in response to the <ORGANIZATION>British Air</ORGANIZATION> decision, <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION>'s pilot union vowed to continue efforts to revive the buy-out.
Pilot union Chairman <PERSON>Frederick C. Dubinsky</PERSON> said advisers to <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> management and the union will begin meeting in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> today and will work through the weekend to devise a new proposal to present to <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>'s board "at the earliest time possible." Pilot union advisers appeared confident that a new bid could go forward even without <LOCATION>British Air</LOCATION>'s participation. 
<ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on <ORGANIZATION>British Air</ORGANIZATION>'s statement.
<ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Stephen M. Wolf</PERSON>, who is leading the management end of the buy-out, hasn't provided investors with any assurances about the prospect of a new deal. 
In another setback yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION>'s machinist union asked the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury Department</ORGANIZATION> to investigate whether certain aspects of the original buy-out proposal violated tax laws.
In an effort to derail the buy-out, the union has already called for investigations by the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department and Labor Department</ORGANIZATION>. 
Still, without the assurance of <ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION>' financial backing, it will be tougher for the buy-out group to convince already-reluctant banks to make loan commitments for a revised bid, especially since <ORGANIZATION>British Air</ORGANIZATION>'s original investment represented 78% of the cash equity contribution for the bid. 
Under the previous plan, <ORGANIZATION>British Air</ORGANIZATION> would have received a 15% stake in <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> in exchange for a $750 million equity investment, with a 75% stake going to <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> employees and 10% to <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> management. 
British <ORGANIZATION>Air</ORGANIZATION> officials said the airline's chairman, <PERSON>Lord King</PERSON>, was concerned about news reports indicating that <ORGANIZATION>British Air</ORGANIZATION> might be willing to participate in a bid that included a lower purchase price and better investment terms for the British carrier. 
The previous reports were based on remarks by <ORGANIZATION>British Air</ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer, <PERSON>Derek Stevens</PERSON>, who said any revised bid would have to include a lower purchase price to reflect the sharp drop in <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>'s stock in the past week. 
<ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stock dropped $1.625 yesterday to $190.125 on volume of 923,500 shares in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on <ORGANIZATION>British Air</ORGANIZATION>'s statement. 
The carrier also seemed eager to place blame on its <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> counterparts. "The {buy-out} consortium ceased to exist because our <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> partners were not capable of organizing the financing," a <ORGANIZATION>British Air</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. 
British Airways may have begun to have second thoughts about the transaction after the <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION> forced <ORGANIZATION>Northwest's Airlines</ORGANIZATION>' new owners to restructure the equity contribution of <ORGANIZATION>KLM Royal Dutch Airlines</ORGANIZATION> in that carrier.
Most of the department's statements since the <ORGANIZATION>Northwest</ORGANIZATION> transaction indicated it planned to curtail foreign ownership stakes in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> carriers. 
Even before <ORGANIZATION>British Air</ORGANIZATION>'s announcement, pilot union leaders had been meeting in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> yesterday to consider their options.
The leaders expressed support for trying to revive the bid following a briefing Wednesday by the union's advisers, <ORGANIZATION>Lazard Freres & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>, <PERSON>Weiss</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Rifkind Wharton & Garrison</ORGANIZATION>.
The buy-out fell through after <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Chase Manhattan Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the lead banks in the transaction, failed to obtain $7.2 billion in financing needed for the plan. 
<LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> Democrat <PERSON>David Pryor</PERSON> spilled his guts on the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> floor the other day after he'd joined the <ORGANIZATION>Finance Committee</ORGANIZATION>'s early-morning pork-barrel revels: "I must tell you . . . I come to the floor tonight as one who ended up with a busload of extraneous matter.
Presidents <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> were both big users of the impoundment power, but <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> saw its chance against a weakened President <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> and stripped it away. 
In 1987, President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> sent 73 rescissions back to the Hill, but only 3% of the spending total was approved by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
"We've had whopping declines in consumer energy prices in each of the past three months, and at the wholesale level those are fully behind us now," said <PERSON>Jay Woodworth</PERSON>, chief domestic economist at <ORGANIZATION>Bankers Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
Still, some analysts insisted that the worst of the inflation is behind. "It increasingly appears that 1987-88 was a temporary inflation blip and not the beginning of a cyclical inflation problem," argued <PERSON>Edward Yardeni</PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
The television units of <ORGANIZATION>Paramount Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>MCA Inc.</ORGANIZATION> are exploring the possibility of offering prime-time programming to independent stations two nights a week, industry executives say. 
Although such a venture wouldn't match the "fourth network" created by <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Fox Broadcasting Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Paramount</ORGANIZATION> may have similar ambitions.
<ORGANIZATION>Paramount Domestic TV</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>MCA TV</ORGANIZATION> formed a joint venture last month, named <ORGANIZATION>Premier Advertiser Sales</ORGANIZATION>, to sell advertising in programs syndicated by both companies, such as "Star Trek: the Next Generation," "Charles in Charge" and "Friday the 13th: the Series." 
Calls to <PERSON>Shelly Schwab</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> TV, weren't returned. 
<ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> owns <ORGANIZATION>WWOR</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Paramount</ORGANIZATION> last month agreed to purchase a 79% stake in the <ORGANIZATION>TVX Broadcast Group</ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in a deal valued at $140 million.
<ORGANIZATION>TVX</ORGANIZATION> owns five stations, including <ORGANIZATION>WTXF</ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON>Fox</PERSON> affiliate, in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>. 
One broadcasting executive familiar with the project said the co-venture would target stations affiliated with <PERSON>Fox</PERSON> because <PERSON>Fox</PERSON> has the desirable independent stations in most of the key cities.
<PERSON>Jamie Kellner</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Fox Broadcasting</ORGANIZATION>, said, "We believe the partnership of <PERSON>Fox</PERSON>, its affiliates and advertisers is succeeding and will continue to grow." 
Another <PERSON>Fox</PERSON> official, who declined to be identified, said <PERSON>Fox</PERSON> wasn't pleased by the possible <ORGANIZATION>Paramount-MCA</ORGANIZATION> venture into prime-time programming. "To make the venture work, they would need <PERSON>Fox</PERSON> affiliates," he said. "We spent a lot of time and money in building our group of stations," he said, adding that <PERSON>Fox</PERSON> doesn't "appreciate" another company attempting to usurp its station lineup. 
Paramount and <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION>, according to the broadcasting executive, plan to offer theatrical movies produced separately by <ORGANIZATION>Paramount</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> for Wednesdays and perhaps a block of original shows Fridays. 
The executive said <ORGANIZATION>Paramount</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> have also held discussions with <ORGANIZATION>Chris-Craft Industries</ORGANIZATION>' broadcasting unit, which owns five independent stations in cities such as <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore</LOCATION>.
"I think it's to <PERSON>Fox</PERSON>'s advantage to be associated with the <ORGANIZATION>Paramount-MCA</ORGANIZATION> venture," said <PERSON>Michael Conway</PERSON>, station manager of <ORGANIZATION>WTXF</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>TVX</ORGANIZATION> station that is a <PERSON>Fox</PERSON> affiliate.
<PERSON>Mr. Conway</PERSON> said the <PERSON>Fox</PERSON> shows appearing on nights when <ORGANIZATION>Paramount-MCA</ORGANIZATION> shows wouldn't be offered could be promoted on the programs produced by <ORGANIZATION>Paramount-MCA</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Michael Fisher</PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION>KTXL</ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON>Fox</PERSON> affiliate in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, said, "The real question is whether the <ORGANIZATION>Paramount-MCA</ORGANIZATION> offering is practical.
<PERSON>Geoffrey Goodfellow</PERSON>, who dropped out of high school back in the 1970s to manage a computer network at a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> research firm, says: "Old network hands have started to turn off the network because they don't have time to wade through the muck." <PERSON>Mr. Goodfellow</PERSON> has started a <LOCATION>Menlo Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, company called <ORGANIZATION>Anterior Technology</ORGANIZATION> that provides human editors for public electronic networks.

One early user, <PERSON>David Semmel</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> venture capitalist and investor in <ORGANIZATION>Desktop Data</ORGANIZATION>, says he uses it to track takeover developments.
He says he told <ORGANIZATION>NewsEdge</ORGANIZATION> to look for stories containing such words as takeover, acquisition, acquire, <ORGANIZATION>LBO</ORGANIZATION>, tender, merger, junk and halted. "I'm pretty confident I'm catching everything," he says. 
<PERSON>Jeffrey Tarter</PERSON>, editor of SoftLetter, a <LOCATION>Watertown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, industry newsletter, says: "I've seen a lot of people fooling around on the fringes of filtering information.

"<PERSON>Mattel</PERSON>'s world-wide volume has grown 25% in a climate of relatively flat industry sales," said <PERSON>John W. Amerman</PERSON>, chairman.
<ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> attributed the jump in quarter net to strong world-wide sales of its Barbie doll, Hot Wheels cars, <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> toys and other well-known toy lines.
<PERSON>Mattel</PERSON> said the company's sale of rights to land and buildings at its <LOCATION>Hawthorne</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, headquarters resulted in a $13 million charge to third-quarter operating profit.
<PERSON>Mattel</PERSON> has purchased a new headquarters building in <LOCATION>El Segundo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, which it will occupy by the end of next year. 
Tuesday's rout of a <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> congressional hopeful in a <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> district that hasn't backed a Democratic presidential candidate since <PERSON>Adlai Stevenson</PERSON> is another reminder that, at least at the federal level, political "ticket splitting" has been on the rise over the past half century.
As we know, voters tend to favor <ORGANIZATION>Republicans</ORGANIZATION> more in races for president than in those for <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
In every presidential election over the past half century, except for the <PERSON>Goldwater</PERSON> presidential candidacy, the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
First, why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century: Prior to the election of <PERSON>Franklin Roosevelt</PERSON> as president and the advent of the <LOCATION>New Deal</LOCATION>, government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> was considerably less severe. 
To the extent that potential <ORGANIZATION>Republican</ORGANIZATION> candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner's dilemma game works to their disadvantage, the <ORGANIZATION>Republican Party</ORGANIZATION> will be hindered in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates. 
To the extent that Democratic legislators from the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION> have held a disproportionate share of power in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies, voters in the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION> have had an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office. 
Finally, the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> races than in campaigns for the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>.
First, economists <PERSON>James Bennett</PERSON> and <PERSON>Thomas DiLorenzo</PERSON> find that <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> senators turn back roughly 10% more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do.
The <ORGANIZATION>Democratic House</ORGANIZATION> attendance rate has not exceeded the <ORGANIZATION>Republican House</ORGANIZATION> attendance rate since 1959. 
An additional piece of evidence from the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>: Holding other factors constant, such as incumbency advantages and regional factors, the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government's tax burden is per state (a progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder).
Put more simply, <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than <ORGANIZATION>Republican</ORGANIZATION> candidates for the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> when the prisoner's dilemma is more severe. 
<PERSON>Mr. Zupan</PERSON> teaches at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Southern California</ORGANIZATION>'s business school. 
As the Hunt brothers' personal bankruptcy cases sputter into their second year, <ORGANIZATION>Minpeco S.A.</ORGANIZATION> has proposed a deal to settle its huge claim against the troubled <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> oil men.
Although the proposal must be approved by federal <PERSON>Judge Harold C. Abramson</PERSON>, <PERSON>W. Herbert Hunt</PERSON> has agreed to the Peruvian mineral concern's proposal.
<PERSON>Nelson Bunker Hunt</PERSON> is considering it, although his attorney says he won't do it if the proposal jeopardizes a tentative settlement he has reached with the <ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION>, which claims the brothers owe $1 billion in back taxes and is by far the biggest creditor in both cases. 
The tentative agreement between the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Nelson Bunker Hunt</PERSON> is awaiting <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> approval.
Under it, the former billionaire's assets would be liquidated with the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> getting 80% of the proceeds and the rest being divided among other creditors, including <ORGANIZATION>Minpeco</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which is seeking repayment of a $36 million loan. 
A similiar proposal has been made in the <PERSON>W. Herbert Hunt</PERSON> case although he and the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> are at odds over the size of the non-dischargable debt he would have to pay to the government from future earnings. 
In both cases, <ORGANIZATION>Minpeco</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Manufacturers Hanover</ORGANIZATION> have been fighting ferociously over their shares of the pie.
With support from the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Manufacturers Hanover</ORGANIZATION> has filed suit asking <PERSON>Judge Abramson</PERSON> to subordinate <ORGANIZATION>Minpeco</ORGANIZATION>'s claim to those of <PERSON>Manufacturer Hanover</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Minpeco</ORGANIZATION> has threatened a "volcano" of litigation if the <ORGANIZATION>Manufacturers Hanover Corp.</ORGANIZATION> unit attempts to force such a plan through the court. 
<ORGANIZATION>Minpeco</ORGANIZATION> said it wouldn't pursue such litigation if its settlement plan in the <PERSON>W. Herbert Hunt</PERSON> case is approved by <PERSON>Judge Abramson</PERSON>, who will consider the proposal at a hearing next week. 
<ORGANIZATION>Minpeco</ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON>Thomas Gorman</PERSON> decribed the plan as one step toward an overall settlement of the <PERSON>W. Herbert Hunt</PERSON> case but <PERSON>Hugh Ray</PERSON>, attorney for Manufacturers Hanover, called it "silly" and said he would fight it in court. 
"The thing is so fluid right now that there's really no way to say what will happen," says <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON>Grover Hartt III</PERSON>, who represents the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> in the case. "Developments like this are hard to predict." 
<ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service</ORGANIZATION> said it lowered its rating on about $75 million of this <LOCATION>Chatsworth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, concern's convertible subordinated debentures, due 2012, to <LOCATION>Caa</LOCATION> from B2.
<ORGANIZATION>VALLEY National Corp.</ORGANIZATION> -- <ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it lowered its rating on about $400 million of this bank holding company's senior debt to B2 from Ba3.
<ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION>'s said it expects <ORGANIZATION>Valley National</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, to make substantial further provisions against its real-estate portfolio, and that it continues to suffer from the high cost of carrying nonperforming assets, and from high loan-loss provisions. 
A <ORGANIZATION>House-Senate</ORGANIZATION> conference approved a nearly $17 billion State, <ORGANIZATION>Justice</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> bill that makes federal reparations for Japanese-Americans held in World War II internment camps a legal entitlement after next Oct. 1. 
The action came as <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> sent to President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> a fiscal 1990 bill providing an estimated $156.7 billion for the <ORGANIZATION>Departments of Labor, Education</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Health and Human Services</ORGANIZATION>.
Final approval was on a 67-31 roll call in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, which sets the stage for a veto confrontation with <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> over the issue of publicly financed abortions for poor women. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>'s veto power puts him a commanding position in the narrowly divided <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, but a vote to override his position could well pick up new support because of the wealth of health and education programs financed in the underlying bill. 
The measure before the conference yesterday funds the <ORGANIZATION>Departments of State</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Justice</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> through fiscal 1990.
Elsewhere in the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION>, nearly $191.2 million is preserved for assistance programs under the <ORGANIZATION>Economic Development Administration</ORGANIZATION>.
And in a footnote to the fall of <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON>James Wright</PERSON> this year, the conference voted to rescind $11.8 million in unspent <ORGANIZATION>EDA</ORGANIZATION> funds for a <LOCATION>Fort Worth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, stockyards project that figured in ethics charges against the former Democratic leader. 
In an unprecedented step, the measure anticipates another $30 million in receipts by having the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Bureau of Investigation</ORGANIZATION> charge for fingerprint services in civil cases -- a change that is almost certain to increase <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> costs in processing personnel and security clearances. 
The bill doesn't include an estimated $1.9 billion in supplemental anti-drug funds for <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> and law-enforcement accounts that are still in conference with the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>.
The odd mix of departments in the bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures, and the assorted provisions attached by lawmakers run from $1.5 million for a fish farm in <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> to a music festival in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> under the <ORGANIZATION>United States Information Agency</ORGANIZATION>.
Lawmakers scrapped all of a $7.4 million <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> request for the 1992 Expo in <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, but agreed elsewhere to $15,000 for an oil portrait of former Chief Justice Warren Burger. 
<ORGANIZATION>Senate Commerce Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Ernest Hollings</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>), who also chairs the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> appropriations subcommittee for the department, attached $10 million for an advanced technology initiative, including work on high-definition television.
His Republican counterpart, <PERSON>Sen. Warren Rudman</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>N.H.</LOCATION>), has used his position to wage a legislative war with the conservative board of the <ORGANIZATION>Legal Services Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
The company cited sales gains at its <ORGANIZATION>Milton Bradley</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Playskool</ORGANIZATION> units and in its international business for the increase in revenue.
<PERSON>Alan G. Hassenfeld</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive, added that <PERSON>Hasbro</PERSON>'s new line of battery-powered racing cars, called <ORGANIZATION>Record Breakers</ORGANIZATION>, and its acquisition of Cabbage Patch Kids, <PERSON>Scrabble</PERSON> and other lines from <ORGANIZATION>Coleco Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> puts the company "in a good position as we enter the Christmas buying season." 
That debt is part of the $2.1 billion of Holiday debt that <ORGANIZATION>Bass PLC</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> said it would retire or assume when it agreed to buy the Holiday Inn business in August. 
The jump reflected record results in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, as well as a full quarter's results from <LOCATION>Harrah</LOCATION>'s Del <LOCATION>Rio</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Laughlin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>James F. Gero</PERSON>, former chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Varo Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Richard J. Hatchett III</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> investment banker, were elected directors of this medical-products concern, boosting the board to seven members. 
MARK RESOURCES INC., <LOCATION>Calgary</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION>, said it agreed to sell 75 million Canadian dollars (US$63.9 million) of 8% convertible debentures to a group of securities dealers.
<PERSON>Mark</PERSON>, an oil and gas concern, said the 15-year debentures are convertible before maturity at C$12.50 for each <PERSON>Mark</PERSON> common share, and can be redeemed at the company's option, under certain conditions, after Nov. 30, 1992. 
-- For the past several years, the banks, lacking a private navy to enforce their interests, have been pressuring the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Treasury</ORGANIZATION> to underwrite their bad <ORGANIZATION>LDC</ORGANIZATION> credits. 
<ORGANIZATION>Pitney Bowes Inc.</ORGANIZATION> directors authorized the company to seek buyers for its <ORGANIZATION>Wheeler Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, a direct mail marketer of office supplies. 
<PERSON>Pitney Bowes</PERSON> said the decision was based on a long-term analysis of the compatibility of <ORGANIZATION>Wheeler Group</ORGANIZATION>'s marketing business with other <PERSON>Pitney Bowes</PERSON> operations.
<PERSON>Pitney Bowes</PERSON> acquired the core of what evolved into <ORGANIZATION>Wheeler Group</ORGANIZATION> in 1979 by buying <ORGANIZATION>Dictaphone Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
A spokeswoman wouldn't comment on whether the company had talked with any potential buyers for the <LOCATION>New Hartford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, unit, which had 1988 sales of about $75 million.
The charges consist of: a $25 million after-tax charge to cover cost overruns in <LOCATION>Ashland</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Riley Consolidated</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary; a previously announced $38 million after-tax charge resulting from a $325 million settlement with <ORGANIZATION>National Iranian Oil Co.</ORGANIZATION> and a $15 million after-tax charge from the previously announced sale of its <ORGANIZATION>Ashland Technology Corp.</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary.
<ORGANIZATION>Banc One Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it agreed in principle to buy five branch offices from <ORGANIZATION>Trustcorp Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, following the planned merger of <ORGANIZATION>Trustcorp</ORGANIZATION> into <ORGANIZATION>Society Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>. 
The five offices in <LOCATION>Erie</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ottawa</LOCATION> counties in northern <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> have total assets of about $88 million, Banc One said.
<ORGANIZATION>Society Corp.</ORGANIZATION> already has branches in the area, and selling the <ORGANIZATION>Trustcorp</ORGANIZATION> offices could avoid a problem with regulators over excessive concentration of banking in the two counties after the merger of <ORGANIZATION>Trustcorp</ORGANIZATION> into Society, according to industry sources.
Now that the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> opened the door on the subject of abortion, politicians are squinting under the glare of <ORGANIZATION>democratic choice</ORGANIZATION>.
Much of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> thought it detected <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> in a characteristic waffle on abortion the past week.
<PERSON>Christopher Smith</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>), a pro-life leader in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, suggested a compromise that would have adapted restrictive language from rape and incest exceptions in the states.
The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>, never eager for a fight, was happy to try, which is why <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> said he was looking for "flexibility" last week. 
When Democrats refused to budge, pro-life Republicans met at the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> with Chief of Staff <PERSON>John Sununu</PERSON> on Monday, and <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> quickly signaled a veto.
The <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> doubters were in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
After the vote, <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>Nancy Johnson</PERSON> rounded up nearly as many signatures on a letter to <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> urging him not to veto.
Even such a pro-life stalwart as <PERSON>Sen. Orrin Hatch</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>) had counseled some kind of compromise.
They're frightened by what they see in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, and especially <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, where pro-life <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> candidates for governor are being pummeled on abortion.
<PERSON>Eddie Mahe</PERSON>, a Republican consultant, says the two <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> candidates could have avoided trouble if they had framed the issue first. (In <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Marshall Coleman</PERSON> and his running mate, <PERSON>Eddy Dalton</PERSON>, are both on the defensive for opposing abortions even in cases of rape or incest.) But <PERSON>Mr. Mahe</PERSON> adds, "The net loser in the next few years is the right-to-life side." 
<PERSON>Darla St. Martin</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>National Right to Life Committee</ORGANIZATION>, says exit polls from the 1988 election had single-issue, pro-life voters giving <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> about five more percentage points of support than pro-choice voters gave <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON>.
<ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> pollster <PERSON>Neil Newhouse</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>Wirthlin Group</ORGANIZATION>, says polls this summer showed that the single-issue voters had about evened out.
<LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> official <PERSON>Robert Fulton</PERSON> lost a chance for a senior job in the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Health and Human Services</ORGANIZATION> after right-to-life activists opposed him.
In the case of <ORGANIZATION>HHS</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Louis Sullivan</PERSON>, the litmus test could yet damage issues important to other parts of the Republican coalition.
After <PERSON>Mr. Sullivan</PERSON> waffled on abortion last year, the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> appeased right-to-lifers by surrounding him with pro-life deputies.
When President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> arrives here next week for a hemispheric summit organized to commemorate a century of Costa Rican democracy, will he be able to deliver a credible message in the wake of the <LOCATION>Panamanian</LOCATION> fiasco?
Undoubtedly <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> will be praised by some Latin leaders prone to pay lip service to nonintervention, while they privately encourage more assertive <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> action to remove Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Noriega</PERSON> and safeguard their countries from a Sandinista onslaught. 
It originates in a <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration decision not to antagonize the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Congress</ORGANIZATION> and avoid, at all costs, being accused of meddling in the region.
The result has been a dangerous vacuum of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> leadership, which leaves Central America open to Soviet adventurism. "The {influence of the} <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is not being felt in <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s decisions do not respond to a policy, and are divorced from reality," says <PERSON>Fernando Volio</PERSON>, a Costa Rican congressman and former foreign minister. 
The disarray of the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration's Latin diplomacy was evident in the failure of the Organization of <LOCATION>American States</LOCATION> to condemn categorically Gen. <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>.
Faced with this embarrassment, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> diplomats expressed confidence that the influential <ORGANIZATION>Rio Group of South American nations</ORGANIZATION>, which gathered last week in <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>, would take a stronger posture toward the Panamanian dictator.
Now <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> will come to <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> and encounter Nicaraguan strongman <PERSON>Daniel Ortega</PERSON>, eager for photo opportunities with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> president.
The host, Costa Rican President <PERSON>Oscar Arias</PERSON>, did not invite <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> to the summit, which was to be restricted to democracies.
Even <PERSON>Carlos Manuel Castillo</PERSON> -- the presidential candidate for <PERSON>Mr. Arias</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Liberation Party</ORGANIZATION> -- made public his opposition to the presence of <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> "in a democratic festivity." 
Nevertheless, the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration agreed to the dubious arrangement in July, a few weeks before the Central American presidents met in <LOCATION>Tela</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>, to discuss a timetable for disbanding the anti-Sandinista rebels.
According to officials in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> hoped that by pleasing President <PERSON>Arias</PERSON>, it would gain his support to postpone any decision on the Contras until after <PERSON>Mr. Ortega</PERSON>'s promises of democratic elections were tested next February.
And even some last-minute phone calls that <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> made (at the behest of some conservative <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> senators) to enlist backing for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> position failed to stop the march of <PERSON>Mr. Arias</PERSON>'s agenda. 
Prior to this episode, <PERSON>Sen. Christopher Dodd</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>), sensing an open field, undertook a personal diplomatic mission through <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION> to promote an early disbanding of the rebels.
Visiting <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>, he praised the <LOCATION>Sandinistas</LOCATION> for their electoral system and chided the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration for not rewarding the <LOCATION>Sandinistas</LOCATION>.
In <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>, where the Contras are a hot political issue, he promised to help unblock some $70 million in assistance withheld due to the failure of local agencies to comply with conditions agreed upon with <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. 
Aid was also the gist of the talks <PERSON>Sen. Dodd</PERSON> had with <LOCATION>Salvadoran</LOCATION> President <PERSON>Alfredo Cristiani</PERSON>; <PERSON>Mr. Cristiani</PERSON>'s government is very much at the mercy of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> largess and is forced to listen very carefully to <PERSON>Sen. Dodd</PERSON>'s likes and dislikes.
It was therefore not surprising that close allies of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, virtually neglected by the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration, ordered the Nicaraguan insurgents dismantled by December, long before the elections.
Fittingly, the <ORGANIZATION>Tela Accords</ORGANIZATION> were nicknamed by <ORGANIZATION>Hondurans</ORGANIZATION> "the <LOCATION>Dodd</LOCATION> plan." 
The individual foreign policy carried out by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> legislators adds to a confusing <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> performance that has emboldened Soviet initiatives in <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION>.
On Oct. 3, following conversations with Secretary of State <PERSON>James Baker</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Soviet</LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON>Eduard Shevardnadze</PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION>Managua</LOCATION> to acclaim "<LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>'s great peace efforts." There, <PERSON>Mr. Shevardnadze</PERSON> felt legitimized to unveil his own peace plan: The <LOCATION>U.S.S.R.</LOCATION> would prolong a suspension of arms shipments to <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> after the February election if the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> did likewise with its allies in <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> claims that in spite of <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>'s words, <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> bloc weapons continue to flow into <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> through <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> at near-record levels. 
Since <PERSON>Mr. Shevardnadze</PERSON>'s proposals followed discussions with <PERSON>Mr. Baker</PERSON>, speculations arose that the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration was seeking an accommodation with the Soviets in <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION>.
This scheme would fit the <ORGANIZATION>Arias Plan</ORGANIZATION>, which declared a false symmetry between Soviet military aid to the <LOCATION>Sandinista</LOCATION> dictatorship and that provided by <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to freely elected governments.
Furthermore, it is also likely to encourage those on Capitol Hill asking for cuts in the assistance to <LOCATION>El Salvador</LOCATION> if President <PERSON>Cristiani</PERSON> does not bend to demands of the Marxist guerrillas. 
The sad condition of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> policy in <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION> is best depicted by the recent end to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sponsorship of <LOCATION>Radio Costa Rica</LOCATION>.
Recovering radiophonic sovereignty was the purpose of <ORGANIZATION>Radio Costa Rica</ORGANIZATION>, funded by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION>Voice of America</ORGANIZATION> (VOA). 
In the meantime, <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> gave <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> another powerful radio transmitter, which has been installed in the city of <LOCATION>Esteli</LOCATION>.
It is capable of reaching the entire <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> area and deep into <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>.
The Soviet entrenchment in <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> is alarming for <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>, a peaceful democracy without an army.
Questioned in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> about what would happen if his much-heralded peace plan would fail, President <PERSON>Arias</PERSON> voiced expectations of direct <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> action.
A poll conducted in July by a Gallup affiliate showed that 64% of Costa Ricans believe that if their country is militarily attacked by either <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> will come to its defense.
But in the light of events in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> has such clear strategic interests, waiting for the <ORGANIZATION>Delta Force</ORGANIZATION> may prove to be a dangerous gambit. 
<PERSON>Mr. Daremblum</PERSON> is a lawyer and a columnist for <ORGANIZATION>La Nacion</ORGANIZATION> newspaper. 
"A lot of this stuff really is in untested waters," says <PERSON>Owen Carney</PERSON>, director of the investment securities division of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> comptroller of the currency. "We don't know how this whole market will work in a serious economic downturn." 
Some predict there will be "Third World bonds," backed by loans to <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and other debt-ridden nations.
"This is the heyday of debt," says <PERSON>James Grant</PERSON>, editor of <PERSON>Grant</PERSON>'s Interest Rate Observer, a newsletter. "Before the sun sets on the '80s, it seems nothing will be left unhocked." 
"We expect additional offerings" of asset-backed securities targeted toward individual investors, says <PERSON>Bill Addiss</PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
The process typically begins when an institution, such as <ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Roebuck & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, takes a pool of credit-card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created trust.
Asset-backed securities "are an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate bonds," says <PERSON>Craig J. Goldberg</PERSON>, managing director and head of the asset-backed securities group at <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ORGANIZATION>. 
That's why some investment managers, such as <PERSON>Alex Powers</PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Chase Manhattan Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s private banking division, don't recommend most asset-backed issues for individuals in high-tax states, such as <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. 
That's particularly true, analysts say, for certain of the securities, such as those backed by time-share loans. "You could see massive gyrations here because it's such a thinly traded market," says <PERSON>Jonathan S. Paris</PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION>European Investors Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investment-management firm. 
In addition, an investor who wants to know the daily value of <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bonds, or corporate bonds traded on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, can simply check newspaper listings.
The front cover of the prospectus for the <ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION> credit-card receivables offering points out in bold capital letters that the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and "do not represent interests in or obligations of the banks, <ORGANIZATION>Citibank N.A.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> or any affiliate thereof." In other words, if there's a problem, don't expect <ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION> to come to the rescue.
"A day of reckoning is coming where we think the market will place a high premium on the highest-quality debt issues, and therefore we think the best debt investment is <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government bonds," says <PERSON>Craig Corcoran</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Davis/Zweig Futures Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, an investment advisory firm. 
What about triple-A-rated asset-backed issues? "<PERSON>Nope</PERSON>, we still say to stick with <ORGANIZATION>Treasurys</ORGANIZATION>," <PERSON>Mr. Corcoran</PERSON> replies.
And it reminds <PERSON>Raymond F. DeVoe Jr.</PERSON>, a market strategist at <ORGANIZATION>Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, of what he calls "DeVoe's Unprovable but Highly Probable Theory No. 1: 
<PERSON>Mr. Herman</PERSON> is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> bureau. 
When he died in 1959, <PERSON>Chandler</PERSON> left behind four chapters of yet another Marlowe book, "The Poodle Springs Story," which seemed to go beyond parody into something like burlesque. "Champ" <PERSON>Chandler</PERSON>'s last pitch, apparently, was a screwball. 
Now <PERSON>Robert Parker</PERSON>, author of several best sellers featuring <PERSON>Spenser</PERSON>, a contemporary private eye in the Marlowe mold, has with the blessings of the <LOCATION>Chandler</LOCATION> estate been hired to complete "The Poodle Springs Story." The result, "Poodle Springs" (<ORGANIZATION>Putnam</ORGANIZATION>'s, 288 pages, $18.95) is an entertaining, easy to read and fairly graceful extension of the Marlowe chronicle, full of hard-boiled wisecracks and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> color.
If it does not quite have <PERSON>Chandler</PERSON>'s special magic -- well, at the end, neither did <PERSON>Chandler</PERSON>. 
As the book begins, a newly wed <ORGANIZATION>Marlowe</ORGANIZATION> roars into the desert resort of <LOCATION>Poodle</LOCATION> (a.k.a.
Palm) <LOCATION>Springs</LOCATION> at the wheel of a <ORGANIZATION>Cadillac Fleetwood</ORGANIZATION>.
His bride is the rich and beautiful <PERSON>Linda Loring</PERSON>, a character who also appeared in <PERSON>Chandler</PERSON>'s "The Long Goodbye" and "Playback." <LOCATION>Philip</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Linda</PERSON> move into her mansion and can't keep their hands off each other, even in front of the Hawaiian/Japanese houseman.
<PERSON>Mr. Parker</PERSON> spins it into a pretty satisfying tale involving <PERSON>Poodle Springs</PERSON> high life, <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> low life and various folk who hang their hats in both worlds.
The supporting lineup is solid, the patter is amusing and there's even a cameo by <PERSON>Bernie Ohls</PERSON>, the "good cop" of previous <PERSON>Chandler</PERSON> books who still doesn't hesitate to have <PERSON>Marlowe</PERSON> jailed when it suits his purposes.
At one point, the reader is two steps ahead of <ORGANIZATION>Marlowe</ORGANIZATION> in catching on to a double identity scam -- and <PERSON>Marlowe</PERSON> is supposed to be the pro.
Contact lenses, tank tops, prostitutes openly working the streets of <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Tequila Sunrise</ORGANIZATION> cocktail all seem out of place in the 1950s.

SANTA FE <ORGANIZATION>PACIFIC PIPELINE PARTNERS Limited Partnership</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, increased its quarterly cash dividend to 60 cents a unit from 55 cents, payable Nov. 14 to units of record Oct. 31.
In a ruling by the <ORGANIZATION>Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Gaubert</PERSON> received the go-ahead to pursue a claim against the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Home Loan Bank Board</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas</ORGANIZATION> for losses he suffered when the <ORGANIZATION>Bank Board</ORGANIZATION> closed the <ORGANIZATION>Independent American Savings Association of Irving</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Gaubert</PERSON>'s suit to recover his damages was dismissed last year by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Robert Maloney</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> under the Federal Tort Claims Act, which offers broad protection for actions by federal agencies and employees. 
Earlier this week, a <ORGANIZATION>Fifth Circuit</ORGANIZATION> appellate panel upheld <PERSON>Judge Maloney</PERSON>'s dismissal of <PERSON>Mr. Gaubert</PERSON>'s claim as a shareholder but said the judge should reconsider <PERSON>Mr. Gaubert</PERSON>'s claim for the loss of his property. "It may depend on whether there was an express or implied promise . . . that the federal officials would not negligently cause the deterioration" of Independent American, the court wrote.
<PERSON>Mr. Gaubert</PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON>Abbe David Lowell</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, says the impact of the ruling on other cases involving thrift takeovers will depend on the degree of similarity in the facts. "I don't know if this will affect one institution or a hundred," <PERSON>Mr. Lowell</PERSON> says. "It does establish a very clear precedent for suing the <ORGANIZATION>FHLBB</ORGANIZATION> where there was none before." 
In a suit filed in state court in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>American Civil Liberties Union</ORGANIZATION> is representing the former maitre'd of the chic <LOCATION>Odeon</LOCATION> restaurant.
The suit, which seeks compensatory and punitive damages of $1 million, alleges that the firing of <ORGANIZATION>Marcia Trees Levine</ORGANIZATION> violated <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> state's human-rights law.
<PERSON>Ms. Levine</PERSON> told her employer that she was pregnant in February; a month later, the suit says, the restaurant manager told <PERSON>Ms. Levine</PERSON> that she would be demoted to his assistant because he felt customers would be uncomfortable with a pregnant maitre'd. 
<PERSON>Kary Moss</PERSON>, an attorney with the <ORGANIZATION>ACLU</ORGANIZATION>'s Women's Rights Project, said, "They wanted a svelte-looking woman, and a pregnant woman is not svelte.
And pregnant women are fat. '" <PERSON>Ms. Moss</PERSON> said <PERSON>Ms. Levine</PERSON> secretly taped many conversations with her bosses at the Odeon in which they told her she was being fired as maitre'd because she was pregnant. 
<PERSON>Paul H. Aloe</PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION>Odeon</ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON>Keith McNally</PERSON>, denied the allegations.
He said <PERSON>Ms. Levine</PERSON> had never been fired, although she had stopped working at the restaurant. "The <PERSON>Odeon</PERSON> made a written offer to <PERSON>Marcia Levine</PERSON> on July 10 to return to work as the maitre'd, at the same pay, same hours and with back pay accrued," he said. 
<PERSON>Mr. Aloe</PERSON> said the <LOCATION>Odeon</LOCATION> "has no policy against hiring pregnant people." 
The defendants were indicted two years ago on charges that they conspired to defraud five thrifts of more than $130 million through a complicated scheme to inflate the price of land and condominium construction along <ORGANIZATION>Interstate</ORGANIZATION> 30, east of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>. 
Assistant <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON>Terry Hart</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> says the government will oppose any efforts to bring in a new defense team because it would delay a retrial. 
<PERSON>Sen. Arlen Specter</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>) urged acquittal of the judge in a brief circulated to his <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> colleagues during closed-door deliberations.
A former prosecutor and member of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Sen. Specter</PERSON> is expected to exercise influence when the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> votes on the impeachment today. 
RICHMOND RESIGNATIONS: Six partners in the <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, firm of <ORGANIZATION>Browder</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Russell, Morris &</ORGANIZATION> Butcher announced they are resigning.
Five of the partners -- <PERSON>James W. Morris</PERSON>, <PERSON>Philip B. Morris</PERSON>, <PERSON>Robert M. White</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ann Adams Webster</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jacqueline G.

<ORGANIZATION>Banco Popular de Puerto Rico</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>BanPonce Corp.</ORGANIZATION> -- agreed to merge in a transaction valued at $324 million. 
<PERSON>Rafael Carrion Jr.</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Banco Popular</ORGANIZATION>, will be the chairman of the holding company.
<PERSON>Alberto M. Paracchini</PERSON>, currently chairman of <ORGANIZATION>BanPonce</ORGANIZATION>, will serve as president of the bank holding company and chairman of the subsidiary. 
<ORGANIZATION>BanPonce</ORGANIZATION> reacted cooly at first, but appeared to be won over, analysts said, by <ORGANIZATION>Banco Popular</ORGANIZATION>'s assurances that it wanted only a friendly transaction. 
"<ORGANIZATION>Banco Popular</ORGANIZATION> just kept waiting," said <PERSON>Edward Thompson</PERSON>, a vice president and analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Thomson BankWatch Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. "They got a transaction that's good for both companies." 
<ORGANIZATION>BanPonce</ORGANIZATION> caters to a more affluent customer, while <ORGANIZATION>Banco Popular</ORGANIZATION> has always had a large presence among middle-income and lower-income markets.
The merger should also allow the companies to reduce costs by combining operations in many locations in <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>. "They're often right across the street from one another," <PERSON>Mr. Thompson</PERSON> said. 
<PERSON>Richard Carrion</PERSON>, who is currently president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Banco Popular</ORGANIZATION>, said the merger will result in a "larger and stronger locally based bank." <PERSON>Mr. Carrion</PERSON>, who will now serve as president and chief executive officer of the subsidiary bank, added: "We'll be able to better compete with large foreign banks.
Missouri farmer <PERSON>Blake Hurst</PERSON> writing in the fall issue of the <ORGANIZATION>Heritage Foundation's Policy Review</ORGANIZATION> about the proposed location of a hazardous-waste incinerator in his county: 
A community of abandoned farmsteads, failing businesses, and crumbling roads and bridges is hardly a desirable one. . . . The loss of 40 jobs by a depressed county in rural <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> is hardly of national importance except for this: If the most environmentally safe way of dealing with a national problem cannot be built in <LOCATION>Atchinson County</LOCATION>, what hope have we for dealing with the wastes our economy produces?
I'd slept through my only previous brush with natural disaster, a tornado 15 or so summers ago near <LOCATION>Traverse City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, so I was unprepared for one reaction to such things: the urge to talk about them.
Flags fly at half-staff for the death of <PERSON>Bart Giamatti</PERSON>, the late baseball commissioner, and now the <LOCATION>Bay Bridge</LOCATION> lies in ruins.
<PERSON>Charles Bradford</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ORGANIZATION>, said higher prices for galvanized and cold-rolled products offset lower prices for bar, hot-rolled and structural steel.
That was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all-day conference on corporate electronic espionage. "Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies and share it with their own companies," said <PERSON>Noel D. Matchett</PERSON>, a former staffer at the federal <ORGANIZATION>National Security Agency</ORGANIZATION> and now president of <ORGANIZATION>Information Security Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, Silver Spring, <LOCATION>Md</LOCATION>. 
It "may well be" that theft of business data is "as serious a strategic threat to national security" as it is a threat to the survival of victimized <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> firms, said <PERSON>Michelle Van Cleave</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>'s assistant director for <ORGANIZATION>National Security Affairs</ORGANIZATION>. 
The conference was jointly sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>New York Institute of Technology School of Management</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association</ORGANIZATION>, a joint industry-government trade group. 
He said that <PERSON>Oliver North</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Iran-Contra</LOCATION> notoriety thought he had erased his computer but that the information was later retrieved for congressional committees to read.
W. <PERSON>Mark Goode</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Micronyx Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Richardson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, firm that makes computer-security products, provided a new definition for <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON>'s campaign for greater openness, known commonly as glasnost.
Under <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Goode</PERSON> said, the Soviets are openly stealing Western corporate communications.
The 1986 tax overhaul, the biggest achievement of President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s second term, is beginning to fall apart, and interest groups are lining up for tax goodies all over <LOCATION>Capitol Hill</LOCATION>. 
As part of the same bill, the finance panel also voted in favor of billions of dollars in narrow tax breaks for individuals and corporations, in what committee member <PERSON>Sen. David Pryor</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>) calls a "feeding frenzy" of special-interest legislating.
To be sure, the full <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, facing a fast-approaching budget deadline, last Friday stripped away all of the tax breaks that were contained in the <ORGANIZATION>Finance Committee</ORGANIZATION> bill.
"There isn't any doubt that the thread of the '86 code has been given a mighty tug," says Rep. <PERSON>Thomas Downey</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>). "You'll see the annual unraveling of it." 
"It's back to tax-give-away time for the select few," says Rep. <PERSON>William Gray</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, the third-ranking Democrat in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>.
Referring to the chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> tax-writing committees, he adds, "Next year, every special-interest group is going to be there knocking on <PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON>'s door, on <PERSON>Danny Rostenkowski</PERSON>'s door." 
The return of pro-investment tax breaks such as those for capital gains and IRAs "creates more of a mood or a mindset that is helpful for getting better depreciation (write-offs) or investment credits," says <PERSON>Paul Huard</PERSON>, a vice president for the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Manufacturers</ORGANIZATION>.
Real-estate interests, for example, are protesting an omission in President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s capital-gains proposal: It doesn't include real-estate gains. "If there is going to be a tax scheme that contemplates lower treatment of capital gains, they certainly want to be part of it," says real-estate lobbyist <PERSON>Wayne Thevenot</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Concord Associates</ORGANIZATION>. 
But <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Christie</PERSON>'s and the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Antique Dealers</ORGANIZATION> are still trying to get theirs.
This year <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, with prodding from President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, has been busy trying to put many of these same tax preferences back into the code.
They wanted reform and they got a revolution," says overhaul advocate Rep. <PERSON>Willis Gradison</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>). 
One recent Saturday morning he stayed inside the Capitol monitoring tax-and-budget talks instead of flying to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> for a fund-raiser and then to his hometown of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> for the 30th reunion of <ORGANIZATION>St. Ignatius High School</ORGANIZATION>. "I'm too old to waste a weekend, but that's what I did," the 48-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Juliano</PERSON> moans. "These days, anything can happen." 
The <LOCATION>Spanish</LOCATION> author <PERSON>Camilo Jose Cela</PERSON> won the Nobel Prize for literature yesterday, a surprising choice, but given the <ORGANIZATION>Swedish Academy</ORGANIZATION>'s past perversities, hardly the most undeserved and ridiculous accolade handed out by the awarding committee.
In <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, anyway, the 73-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Cela</PERSON> enjoys some renown for the novels and travel books he wrote during the parched <LOCATION>Franco</LOCATION> years, the everyday poverty and stagnant atmosphere of which he described in brutally direct, vivid prose, beginning with "The Family of Pascal Duarte" (1942). 
Unlike other writers who either battled the fascists during the Civil War, or left <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> when <LOCATION>Franco</LOCATION> triumphed, <PERSON>Mr. Cela</PERSON> fought briefly on the general's side, no doubt earning with his war wound some forbearance when he went on to depict a country with a high population of vagabonds, murderers and rural idiots trudging aimlessly through a dried-out land.
The man who wore out his shoes wandering around <LOCATION>Guadalajara</LOCATION> in 1958, describing in his travel book "Viaje a la <LOCATION>Alcarria</LOCATION>" how he scrounged for food and stayed in squalid inns, now tours <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> in a <ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce</ORGANIZATION>. 
Of his 10 novels, "The Hive" (1951), full of sharp vignettes of <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> life and centered on a cafe run by <PERSON>Dona Rosa</PERSON>, a foul-mouthed, broad-based woman with blackened little teeth encrusted in filth, used to be available in English, translated by <PERSON>J.M.

B.A.T aims to sell such <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> retailing units as <ORGANIZATION>Marshall Field</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Saks Fifth Avenue</ORGANIZATION> and float its big paper and British retailing businesses via share issues to existing holders.
"We are not in any hurry to sell" <PERSON>Saks</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Marshall Field</LOCATION> or <ORGANIZATION>B.A.T</ORGANIZATION>'s other <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> retail properties, said Chairman <PERSON>Patrick Sheehy</PERSON>. "This isn't a distress sale.

<PERSON>Paul Fireman</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Our gains in earnings provide further evidence that the controls we have put in place and our sales mix are continuing to improve the company's overall profit performance." 
Separately, <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION> completed the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>CML Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Boston Whaler</ORGANIZATION> unit, a builder of power boats. 
<ORGANIZATION>CML</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Acton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, had agreed to sell the unit to <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION> for about $42 million.
The agreement also called for <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION> to receive warrants to purchase 400,000 shares of <ORGANIZATION>CML</ORGANIZATION> common at $31.25 a share, exercisable at any time before July 1, 
<ORGANIZATION>Amoco</ORGANIZATION>'s domestic oil and natural gas operations recorded a profit of $104 million in the quarter compared with a loss of $5 million, "primarily on the strength of higher crude oil prices," said Chairman <PERSON>Richard M. Morrow</PERSON>.
<ORGANIZATION>Amoco</ORGANIZATION> also sharply boosted natural-gas output, part of it from properties acquired from <ORGANIZATION>Tenneco Inc.</ORGANIZATION> last year. 
"Indexing has been the most single successful investment concept in the last decade, but the index money has been just sort of sitting there," says <PERSON>Seth M. Lynn</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Axe Core Investors Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, an indexer based in <LOCATION>Tarrytown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION> "Now the interest is in what else can I do with that money." Among the souped-up indexing strategies: Indexed portfolios can be built around thousands of stocks, or just a few dozen, rather than being restricted to the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 companies.
One reason for these hybrids is that indexing's rapid growth is slowing, particularly for those "plain vanilla" funds that mirror the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500. "There isn't a boatload {of big investors} out there still waiting to get into indexing," says <PERSON>P. James Kartalia</PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION>ANB Investment Management Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, which offers both indexing and active management services. (After tripling in size in the past five years, index funds now hold about 20% of the stock owned by pension funds.) 
To land customers for their well-paying stock custodial business, big banks sometimes will throw in basic indexing services for free. "It's like getting a free toaster when you open an account," says <PERSON>Axe Core</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Mr. Lynn</PERSON>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Westridge Capital</ORGANIZATION> has used enhanced indexing techniques to beat the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500's returns by 2.5 to 3 percentage points over the past four years, with the same risk level as holding the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 stocks, according to <PERSON>James Carder</PERSON>, the firm's president. 
<PERSON>J. Thomas Allen</PERSON>, president of Pittsburgh-based <ORGANIZATION>Advanced Investment Management Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, agrees it's a good idea to jump between the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 stocks and futures. "You're buying the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION>, and you always want to hold the cheapest form of it," he says. 
But some indexers make little or no use of futures, saying that these instruments present added risks for investors. "If the futures markets have a problem, then those products could have a problem," says <PERSON>John Zumbrunn</PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION>Prudential Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Investment Index Technologies Inc.</ORGANIZATION> unit. 
That leaves $13, which could be used to buy <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 options that will nearly match any gain in the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> index. 
Instead of hiring one of the many active managers specializing in growth stocks, indexers can design a portfolio around the same stocks; the portfolio will be maintained by computer, reducing both fees and, in theory, risk (because of the large number of stocks). "We see a lot of interest in those kind of things," says <PERSON>Frank Salerno</PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Bankers Trust</ORGANIZATION>. "People comfortable with the passive approach are using them for other strategies." 
One simple approach is to exclude <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 companies considered bankruptcy candidates; this can avoid weak sisters, but also can hurt when a company like <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION> rebounds.
The figures exclude businesses now organized as <ORGANIZATION>American Express Information Services Co</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> card charge volume rose 12%.
<ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>'s share of <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>'s earnings was $41 million, after preferred stock dividends; it owns about 68% of <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>'s common. 
By comparison, the <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones Industrials</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange Composite</ORGANIZATION> each rose 1.5%. 
<PERSON>Jeremiah Mullins</PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION>OTC</ORGANIZATION> trading at <ORGANIZATION>Dean Witter Reynolds</ORGANIZATION>, said both institutional and retail investors were buying.
"There's no pressure on <ORGANIZATION>OTC</ORGANIZATION> stocks at this point," said <PERSON>Mr. Mullins</PERSON>, who said some buyers are beginning to shop among smaller OTC issues. 
<PERSON>Rick Sherlund</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs</ORGANIZATION> analyst, has raised his earnings estimates for the company twice in the past two weeks, citing improved margins.
Among other software issues, <ORGANIZATION>Autodesk</ORGANIZATION> jumped 1 1/4 to 42, <ORGANIZATION>Lotus Development</ORGANIZATION> was unchanged at 32 1/2, <ORGANIZATION>Novell</ORGANIZATION> jumped 7/8 to 30 3/4, <ORGANIZATION>Ashton-Tate</ORGANIZATION> gained 1/4 to 10 5/8, and <ORGANIZATION>Oracle Systems</ORGANIZATION> rose 3/4 to 25 3/4. 
In the 1988 quarter, the <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, commercial banking concern earned $18.7 million. 
<ORGANIZATION>Valley National</ORGANIZATION> said its $110 million provision for credit losses and $11 million provision for other real estate owned is related to weakness in the <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> real estate market.
Additionally, <ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service</ORGANIZATION> said it downgraded <ORGANIZATION>Valley National</ORGANIZATION>'s senior debt and confirmed the company's commercial paper rating of "not prime." 
<ORGANIZATION>Raymond James & Associates</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>St. Petersburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, lowered its third-quarter earnings estimate for the company, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. 
<ORGANIZATION>East Rock Partners</ORGANIZATION>, which has indicated it might make a bid for the company, said <ORGANIZATION>A.P. Green</ORGANIZATION>, a refractory products maker, told the partnership it isn't for sale. 
Your Oct. 12 editorial "Pitiful, Helpless Presidency?" correctly states that I was critical of the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration's failure to have any plan in place to respond in a timely fashion to the opportunities to oust <PERSON>Manuel Noriega</PERSON> presented by the attempted military coup on Oct. 3. 
Although you may have forgotten, public opinion about Gen. <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> is where it is in large measure because of my investigation of his years of involvement in narcotics smuggling (and simultaneous work as a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> operative).
The public made up its mind about Gen. <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> largely as a result of the hearings I chaired in the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Narcotics of the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Relations Committee</ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 8, 9, 10 and 11, 1988, and again on April 4, 1988.
It was during those hearings that the nation first learned the breadth and depth of Gen. <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s criminality, and of his enduring relationships with a variety of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government agencies. 
Those hearings also highlighted how Gen. <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> was able to use his relationships with these agencies to delay <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> action against him, and to exploit the administration's obsession with overthrowing the <LOCATION>Sandinistas</LOCATION> to protect his own drug-dealing.
As former Ambassador to <LOCATION>Costa</LOCATION> <PERSON>Rica Francis J. McNeil</PERSON> testified before the subcommittee, the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration knew that Gen. <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> was involved with narcotics, but made a decision in the summer of 1986 "to put Gen. <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> on the shelf until <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> was settled." 
As the report issued by the subcommittee concluded, "Our government did nothing regarding Gen. <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s drug business and substantial criminal involvement because the first priority was the <ORGANIZATION>Contra</ORGANIZATION> war.
Throughout 1988 and this year, I and others in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> have pressed the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> to develop a plan for pushing this "narcokleptocrat" out of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Sen. John Kerry</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>) 
<ORGANIZATION>Chase Manhattan Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, after trying unsuccessfully to sell its interest in its lower <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> operations building, has exercised its option to purchase the 50-story office tower. 
Chase had purchased an option to buy the building at One <LOCATION>New York Plaza</LOCATION> for an undisclosed sum from the late Sol <LOCATION>Atlas</LOCATION> as part of its original lease in 1970. 
As part of its decision to leave the building, <PERSON>Chase</PERSON> tried to sell its interest, along with the <LOCATION>Atlas</LOCATION> estate's interest, shortly after the October 1987 stock market crash.
He said <PERSON>Chase</PERSON> and the <LOCATION>Atlas</LOCATION> estate were looking to sell the entire building for $400 million to $475 million, but didn't get an offer for more than $375 million. 
In addition, another major building tenant, <ORGANIZATION>Thomson McKinnon Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Thomson McKinnon Securities</ORGANIZATION>, likely will vacate the premises as part of its liquidation. 
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> real estate brokerage <ORGANIZATION>Edward S. Gordon Co.</ORGANIZATION> will have the difficult task of finding new tenants.
Just because <LOCATION>Stamford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>High School</ORGANIZATION> did nothing when its valuable 1930s mural was thrown in the trash doesn't mean the city no longer owns the work of art, a federal judge ruled. 
The 100-foot-long mural, painted by <PERSON>James Daugherty</PERSON> in 1934, was commissioned by the federal <ORGANIZATION>Works Project Administration</ORGANIZATION>. 
After the discarded mural was found outside the school by a concerned <LOCATION>Stamford</LOCATION> graduate, it eventually was turned over to <PERSON>Hiram Hoelzer</PERSON>, a professional art restorer. 
In 1986, <ORGANIZATION>Stamford</ORGANIZATION> officials thanked <PERSON>Mr. Hoelzer</PERSON> for taking care of the mural -- and demanded he return it as soon as possible.
<PERSON>Mr. Hoelzer</PERSON>, however, sued <LOCATION>Stamford</LOCATION>, claiming that the city had abandoned the artwork and that it had waited too long to reclaim it. 
But <PERSON>Judge Louis L. Stanton</PERSON> of federal court in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> ruled that the city couldn't be faulted for waiting too long because it didn't realize until 1986 that its ownership of the painting was in dispute.
<PERSON>Mary E. Sommer</PERSON>, corporate counsel for <LOCATION>Stamford</LOCATION>, said the city has discussed several possible plans for displaying the mural, which portrays various scenes from the Great Depression.
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> closed at $28.125 a share, down 37.5 cents. 
<ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones & Co.</ORGANIZATION> recently reported net fell 9.9%, a reflection, in part, of continued softness in financial advertising at <ORGANIZATION>The Wall Street Journal</ORGANIZATION> and Barron's magazine. 
"We expect next year to be a fairly soft year in newspaper-industry advertising," said <PERSON>John Morton</PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Lynch, Jones & Ryan</ORGANIZATION>. "Next year, earnings will hold steady, but we just don't see a big turnaround in the trend in advertising." 
<PERSON>John S. Reidy</PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said, "The Times faces the same problem of other publishers: linage is down.
In the quarterly report, <PERSON>Arthur Ochs Sulzberger</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>New York Times Co.</ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer, said negative factors affecting third-quarter earnings will continue.
<PERSON>Mr. Sulzberger</PERSON> said the scheduled opening of a new color-printing plant in <LOCATION>Edison</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, in 1990 would involve heavy startup and depreciation costs. 
"With the <LOCATION>Edison</LOCATION> plant coming on line next summer, the <ORGANIZATION>Times</ORGANIZATION> is facing some tough earnings comparison in the future," said <PERSON>Peter Appert</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>C.J. Lawrence</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Grenfell</ORGANIZATION>. "But many newspapers are facing similar comparisons." 
<ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Reidy</PERSON> pointed out that "profits held up in a tough revenue environment.
When the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> opened the door this year to new restrictions on abortion, <PERSON>Ms. Ehman</PERSON> opened her mind to Democratic politics.
Now she leads a grassroots abortion-rights campaign in <LOCATION>Passaic County</LOCATION> for pro-choice Democratic gubernatorial candidate <PERSON>James Florio</PERSON>. 
"This is one where I cross party lines," she says, rejecting the anti-abortion stance of Rep. <PERSON>Florio</PERSON>'s opponent, <ORGANIZATION>Reagan-Republican</ORGANIZATION> Rep. <PERSON>James Courter</PERSON>. "People my age thought it wasn't going to be an issue.
<ORGANIZATION>New Jersey</ORGANIZATION>'s own highest court remains a liberal bulwark against major restrictions on abortion, but the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> ruling, <PERSON>Webster</PERSON> vs.
A recent pro-choice rally in <LOCATION>Trenton</LOCATION> drew thousands, and in a major reversal, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> is defying a presidential veto and demanding that Medicaid abortions be permitted in cases of rape and incest. 
"If Webster hadn't happened, you wouldn't be here," <PERSON>Linda Bowker</PERSON> tells a reporter in the <LOCATION>Trenton</LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION>National Organization for Women</ORGANIZATION>. "We could have shouted from the rooftops about <PERSON>Courter</PERSON> . . . and no one would have heard us." 
In <PERSON>Cherry Hill</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Abortion Rights Action League</ORGANIZATION>, whose goal is to sign up 50,000 pro-choice voters, targets a union breakfast to build labor support for its cause.
A year ago this fall, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> voters under 30 favored <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> by 56% to 39% over <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON>, according to a survey then by <ORGANIZATION>Rutgers University's Eagleton Institute</ORGANIZATION>.
Voters in the same age group backed <ORGANIZATION>Democrat Florio</ORGANIZATION> 55% to 29% over Republican <PERSON>Courter</PERSON>. 
The <LOCATION>Camden County</LOCATION> congressman still carries himself with a trademark "I'm-coming-down-your-throat" intensity, but at a pause in <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION>'s Columbus Day parade recently, he was dancing with his wife in the middle of the avenue in the city's old <LOCATION>Italian-American</LOCATION> ward.
<PERSON>Mr. Courter</PERSON>, by comparison, seems a shadow of the confident hawk who defended <PERSON>Oliver North</PERSON> before national cameras at <LOCATION>Iran-Contra</LOCATION> hearings two years ago.
"He doesn't know himself," <PERSON>Kathy Stanwick</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Abortion Rights League</ORGANIZATION> says of <PERSON>Mr. Courter</PERSON>'s position.
Even abortion opponents, however angry with <PERSON>Mr. Florio</PERSON>, can't hide their frustration with the <ORGANIZATION>Republican</ORGANIZATION>'s ambivalence. "He doesn't want to lead the people," says <PERSON>Richard Traynor</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey Right</ORGANIZATION> to Life. 
Elected to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in 1978, the 48-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Courter</PERSON> is part of a generation of young conservatives who were once very much in the lead of the rightward shift under <PERSON>Mr. Reagan</PERSON>.
Like many of his colleagues, he didn't serve in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> in the 1960s yet embraced a hawkish defense and foreign policy -- even voting against a 1984 resolution critical of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> mining of Nicaraguan harbors. 
<PERSON>Jack Kemp</PERSON> and the writers <PERSON>Irving Kristol</PERSON> and <PERSON>George Gilder</PERSON> were influences, and <PERSON>Mr. Courter</PERSON>'s own conservative credentials proved useful to the current <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey GOP</ORGANIZATION> governor, <PERSON>Thomas Kean</PERSON>, in the 1981 Republican primary here. 
The same partnership is now crucial to <PERSON>Mr. Courter</PERSON>'s fortunes, but the abortion issue is only a reminder of the gap between his record and that of the more moderate, pro-choice Gov. <PERSON>Kean</PERSON>.
While the <ORGANIZATION>Warren County</ORGANIZATION> congressman pursued an anti-government, anti-tax agenda in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON>Kean</PERSON> was approving increased income and sales taxes at home and overseeing a near doubling in the size of <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>'s budget in his eight years in office. 
<PERSON>Mr. Courter</PERSON>'s free-market plan to bring down auto insurance rates met criticism from Gov. <PERSON>Kean</PERSON>'s own insurance commissioner.
Fluent in <LOCATION>Spanish</LOCATION> from his days in the <ORGANIZATION>Peace Corps</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Courter</PERSON> actively courts minority voters but seems oddly over his head.
He is warm and polished before a <ORGANIZATION>Puerto Rican Congress</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Asbury Park</LOCATION>.
Details and <LOCATION>Camden</LOCATION> are essential <PERSON>Florio</PERSON>.
His base in <LOCATION>South Jersey</LOCATION> and on the <ORGANIZATION>House Energy and Commerce Committee</ORGANIZATION> helped him sustain a network of political-action committees to preserve his edge.
In <LOCATION>Monmouth</LOCATION>, an important swing area, <ORGANIZATION>Republican</ORGANIZATION> freeholders now run on a slogan promising to keep the county "clean and green." 
Hard-hitting consultants match ads with <PERSON>Mr. Courter</PERSON>'s team, and <PERSON>Mr. Florio</PERSON> retools himself as the lean, mean Democratic fighting machine of the 1990s.
Appealing to a young audience, he scraps an old reference to <LOCATION>Ozzie</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Harriet</PERSON> and instead quotes the Grateful Dead.
The <ORGANIZATION>Democratic</ORGANIZATION> lawmaker fits a pattern of younger reformers arising out of old machines, but his ties to <LOCATION>Camden</LOCATION> remain a sore point because of the county's past corruption.
<PERSON>Pasquale Pignatelli</PERSON>, an unlikely but enthusiastic pipe major in an <LOCATION>Essex County Irish</LOCATION> bagpipe band, speaks sadly of <PERSON>Mr. Florio</PERSON>. "I am a devout Catholic," says <PERSON>Mr. Pignatelli</PERSON>, a 40-year-old health officer. "I can't support him because of abortion." 
<PERSON>Bill Wames Sr.</PERSON>, 72, is Catholic too, but unfazed by <PERSON>Mr. Florio</PERSON>'s stand on abortion.
A security guard at a cargo terminal, he wears a Sons of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> jacket and cap celebrating "The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> 1 Band." "I still think the woman has the right to do with her body as she pleases," he says. "If you want more opinions ask my wife.
Trotting out a much-beloved <PERSON>Streetspeak</PERSON> term, <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>John Phelan</PERSON> recently declared that history would record the event as only "a major technical correction." 
At <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, they are "financial consultants." At <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Prudential Bache Securities</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, they are "account executives." At <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, they are "investment executives." 
<PERSON>Larry Biehl</PERSON>, a money manager in <LOCATION>San Mateo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, blames that on the advent of program trading, in which computers used by big institutional investors are programmed to buy and sell big blocks when certain market conditions prevail.

<ORGANIZATION>Berkshire Hathaway</ORGANIZATION> earlier this year bought $600 million of preferred stock in <ORGANIZATION>Gillette</ORGANIZATION> that is convertible into an 11% stake, and <ORGANIZATION>Gillette</ORGANIZATION> said at the time that <PERSON>Mr. Buffett</PERSON> would be added to the board. 
The prices of corn futures contracts jumped amid rumors that the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> is keeping up its dizzying October buying binge of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> corn. 
Those rumors were confirmed after the end of trading yesterday when the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> announced that the Soviets had bought 1.2 million metric tons of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> corn, bringing their <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> corn purchases confirmed so far this month to about five million metric tons. 
Among other things, the <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> is widely thought to be mulling whether to subsidize the sale of soybean oil to the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>. 
On top of all this, corn and soybean prices rose on reports that the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> harvest was disrupted by a freakishly early snow storm that dumped several inches in parts of <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Balmy</ORGANIZATION> temperatures are forecast for next week, said <PERSON>Robert Lekberg</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Farmers Grain & Livestock Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. 
Also, the analyst said, economic circumstances are such that both <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, the principal gold and platinum producers, are being forced to continue selling the metals.
Some of this buying was by <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, which has had its supplies sharply reduced by long production stoppages at the <LOCATION>Bougainville</LOCATION> mine in <LOCATION>Papua New Guinea</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Highland Valley</LOCATION> mine in <LOCATION>British Columbia</LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION>Cananea</LOCATION> mine in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, which are major shippers to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
The increasing likelihood that <LOCATION>Cananea</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Highland Valley</LOCATION> will soon return to production may have cut some of that purchasing, but even if any of these mines begin operating soon, their output won't be significant until at least the end of the year, analysts note.
<PERSON>Sheldon B. Lubar</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Lubar & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>John L. Murray</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Universal Foods Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, were elected to the board of this engine maker.

"If you don't save your critical people, you won't be able to bring up your vital business functions." 
Although <ORGANIZATION>ARCO</ORGANIZATION>'s head office, more than 300 miles from the epicenter, wasn't affected by this week's tremors, <PERSON>Ms. Masaki-Schatz</PERSON> used the occasion to distribute a three-page memo of "Earthquake Tips" to 1,200 <ORGANIZATION>ARCO</ORGANIZATION> employees. 
<ORGANIZATION>ARCO</ORGANIZATION> maintains an office in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> that would take over if payroll operations in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> were disrupted.
At <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the earthquake came just as the company was reviewing its own emergency procedures. "We were talking about scheduling a practice drill for November," says <PERSON>Joan Tharp</PERSON>, a spokeswoman. "Then we had a real one in the afternoon." 
The <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, computer maker scrambled to set up a special phone line to tell manufacturing and support staff to stay home Wednesday.
<ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard</ORGANIZATION> also called in its systems experts to restore its own computer operations. "That means we can accept orders" and begin getting back to normal, says <PERSON>Ms. Tharp</PERSON>. 
Prompted by an earlier <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> earthquake, as well as a fire in a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> office tower, <LOCATION>Great Western Bank</LOCATION> in the past year hired three emergency planners and spent $75,000 equipping a trailer with communications gear to serve as an emergency headquarters.

You have time to put precautionary mechanisms in place," notes a <ORGANIZATION>Vista</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. "A situation like <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> is so frightening because there's no warning." 
Yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it postponed a $220 million senior subordinated debenture offering by <ORGANIZATION>York International Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
And <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.</ORGANIZATION> scrambled to restructure and improve the potential returns on a $475 million debenture offering by <ORGANIZATION>Chicago & North Western Acquisition Corp.</ORGANIZATION> that was still being negotiated late last night. 
On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION> had to slash the size of <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION>' junk-bond offering to $71 million from $150 million.
<ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc.</ORGANIZATION> has delayed <ORGANIZATION>Grand Union Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's $1.16 billion junk-bond offering while it restructures the transaction.
<ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache</ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION>York</LOCATION> issue was delayed because of market conditions. 
"Everything is going through firehoops right now, and {<ORGANIZATION>Chicago & North Western</ORGANIZATION>} is no exception," said <PERSON>Mariel Clemensen</PERSON>, vice president, high-yield research, at <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Dan Baldwin</PERSON>, managing director of high-yield investments at Chancellor Capital Management, said the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago & North Western</ORGANIZATION> offering was restructured in part because "several large insurance buyers right now are demanding equity as part of the package.
To lure buyers to the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago & North Western</ORGANIZATION> bonds, portfolio managers said <PERSON>Donaldson Lufkin</PERSON> sweetened the transaction by offering the bonds with a resettable interest rate and a 10% equity kicker.
The equity arrangement apparently would allow bondholders to buy a total of 10% of the stock of <ORGANIZATION>CNW Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Chicago & North Western</ORGANIZATION>'s parent company.
According to some analysts familiar with the negotiations, the 10% of equity would come directly from <PERSON>Donaldson Lufkin</PERSON> and a fund affiliated with the investment bank <ORGANIZATION>Blackstone Group</ORGANIZATION>, which would reduce their <ORGANIZATION>CNW</ORGANIZATION> equity holdings by 5% each.
That would leave the <ORGANIZATION>Blackstone</ORGANIZATION> fund with a 60% stake and <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson Lufkin</ORGANIZATION> with 15%. 
Junk bonds ended about one-half point higher with so-called high-quality issues from <ORGANIZATION>RJR Capital Holdings Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership</ORGANIZATION> rising one point. 
They are telling us that {8 3/4%} is as low as they want to see the fed funds rate," said <PERSON>Robert Chandross</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Lloyds Bank PLC</ORGANIZATION>. 
Dealers said junk bond issues on average were up by 1/4 to 1/2 point with so-called quality issues from <ORGANIZATION>RJR Capital Holdings Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership</ORGANIZATION> posting one-point gains. 
<ORGANIZATION>Petrolane Gas Service</ORGANIZATION>'s 13 1/4% debentures traded at 102, after trading around par earlier this week, and <ORGANIZATION>RJR</ORGANIZATION>'s 13 1/2% subordinated debentures of 2001 were at 101 5/8 after trading at below par earlier this week. 
It's also unclear precisely how the state will rebuild its reserve, said <PERSON>Cindy Katz</PERSON>, assistant director of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s department of finance, although she noted that a bond offering for that purpose isn't anticipated. 
Mortgage securities generally ended 6/32 to 9/32 point higher, but lagged gains in the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> market because of a shift in the shape of the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> yield curve and rumored mortgage sales by thrifts. 
Premium Government <ORGANIZATION>National Mortgage Association</ORGANIZATION> securities with coupon rates of 13% and higher actually declined amid concerns about increased prepayments because of a plan being considered by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to speed the refinancing of government-subsidized mortgages. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ginnie Mae</ORGANIZATION> 9% securities ended at 98 6/32, up 9/32, and <ORGANIZATION>Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 9% securities were at 97 10/32, up 6/32.
The <ORGANIZATION>Ginnie Mae</ORGANIZATION> 9% issue was yielding 9.42% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> 10-year note widened 0.03 percentage point to 1.48. 
In <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, the bellwether No. 111 4.6% bond of 1998 ended off 0.03 at 95.72, to yield 5.32%, and in <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, the 7% benchmark issue due October 1999 ended 0.05 point lower at 99.85 to yield 7.02%.

<ORGANIZATION>Senate Democrats</ORGANIZATION> favoring a cut in the capital-gains tax have decided, under pressure from their leaders, not to offer their own proposal, placing another obstacle in the path of President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s legislative priority. 
But <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON>George Mitchell</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>), a vigorous opponent of the capital-gains tax cut, called the group to meet with him Wednesday night and again yesterday.
The decision is a setback for President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, who needs the support of Democrats to pass the tax cut through the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
Still, <PERSON>Sen. Bob Packwood</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>), the lead sponsor of the Republican capital-gains amendment, predicted that the tax cut would be enacted this year.
Yesterday, in an interview, he added that the Democrats' decision "increases the likelihood that a capital-gains tax cut will not pass this year." <PERSON>Mr. Mitchell</PERSON>'s first victory came last week, when the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> passed a deficit-reduction bill that didn't contain a capital-gains provision.
That vote made it unlikely that a capital-gains tax cut would be included in the final bill, now being drafted by <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> negotiators.
To help lay the groundwork for that fight, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> plans early next week to meet at the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> with some 20 Democratic senators who favor cutting the capital-gains tax or are undecided on the issue. 
The president apparently will have only one bill to push, <PERSON>Sen. Packwood</PERSON>'s, and at least some of the dissident Democrats plan to support it. "I may want to offer additional amendments to improve it when the bill comes to the floor," said <PERSON>Sen. David Boren</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Okla.</LOCATION>), a leader of those Democrats. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Packwood</ORGANIZATION> plan also would include a proposal, designed by <PERSON>Sen. William Roth</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Del.</LOCATION>), that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts.
When they do hit, they hit fast," says <PERSON>David A. Wyss</PERSON>, chief financial economist at the <ORGANIZATION>Data Resources division of McGraw-Hill Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
Though he himself doesn't expect a recession soon, <PERSON>Mr. Wyss</PERSON> advises people who do that "the best thing to be in is long that is, 20-year to 30-year <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bonds." 
It's an "absolute necessity" to get out of junk bonds when a recession is in the offing, says <PERSON>Avner Arbel</PERSON>, professor of finance at <ORGANIZATION>Cornell University</ORGANIZATION>. "Such bonds are very sensitive to the downside, and this could be a disaster." 
One of these is <PERSON>Jeffrey L. Beach</PERSON>, director of research for <ORGANIZATION>Underwood Neuhaus & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a brokerage house in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, who thinks that "we're either in a recession or about to go into one." What's more, he thinks this could be a nastier recession than usual: "Once the downturn comes, it's going to be very hard to reverse." 
Instead, <PERSON>Mr. Beach</PERSON> says, investors "probably should be carrying a very high level of cash," by which he means such so-called cash equivalents as money-market funds and <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bills.
<PERSON>Greg Confair</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Sigma Financial Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Allentown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, also recommends that investors go heavily for cash.
The <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Board</ORGANIZATION>'s plan for a "soft landing," he says, requires the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> to navigate "an ever-narrowing corridor." 
He believes that the task facing <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Alan Greenspan</PERSON> is so difficult that it resembles "juggling a double-bladed ax and a buzz saw." 
Moreover, because no one knows for sure just when a recession is coming, some analysts think investors shouldn't even worry too much about timing. "Trying to time the economy is a mistake," says <PERSON>David Katz</PERSON>, chief investment officer of <ORGANIZATION>Value Matrix Management Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
According to <PERSON>Ned Davis</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Ned Davis Research Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Nokomis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, the average drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was about 21%, and the decrease began an average of six months before a recession officially started. 
For example, <PERSON>Mr. Arbel</PERSON> says, stocks of small companies are selling for about 19 times cash flow. (Cash flow, basically earnings plus depreciation, is one common gauge of a company's financial health.) That ratio is dangerously close to the ratio of 19.7 that prevailed before the 1987 stock-market crash, <PERSON>Mr. Arbel</PERSON> says.
<PERSON>George Putnam III</PERSON>, editor of Turnaround Letter in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, offers one final tip for recession-wary investors. "Keep some money available for opportunities," he says. "If the recession does hit, there will be some great investment opportunities just when things seem the blackest."

<LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s industrial wholesale sales index rose 13.2% in June from a year earlier, the state statistical institute <ORGANIZATION>Istat</ORGANIZATION> said.

Steel jackets of a type that may have prevented collapse of the columns of a 1.5-mile stretch of the Nimitz Freeway had been installed on at least a small test section of the double-decker highway last year by <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Department of Transportation</ORGANIZATION>, employees familiar with the project say. 
The failure in <ORGANIZATION>Oakland</ORGANIZATION> of the freeway segment known as the <ORGANIZATION>Cypress</ORGANIZATION> structure was the deadliest aspect of the quake, although officials were hopeful yesterday that the death toll there might be significantly lower than the 250 initially feared. 
Knowledgeable employees said the retrofitting, which hadn't yet been budgeted, was part of a planned, three-stage reinforcement of the <ORGANIZATION>Cypress</ORGANIZATION> structure begun by the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> transportation department several years ago.
After completing installation of the jackets on "one frame" of the freeway last year, the state <ORGANIZATION>DOT</ORGANIZATION> had sent the project over to its <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> engineers to draw up a final design. 
"I want to know who made the decision that it was safe for 186,000 people to use every day," said <PERSON>Richard Katz</PERSON>, a state legislator who is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>California Assembly</ORGANIZATION>'s transportation committee.
"Unfortunately, there is only one laboratory for developing techniques to withstand earthquakes, and that is an earthquake," said <PERSON>Burch Bachtold</PERSON>, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> district director for the <ORGANIZATION>transportation department</ORGANIZATION>. 
When <PERSON>Walter Yetnikoff</PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>CBS Records</ORGANIZATION>, last month told producer <PERSON>Peter Guber</PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> was about to make a $3.4 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Pictures</ORGANIZATION> and needed someone to run the studio, <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> jumped at the chance. 
Within two days, he was on his way to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> to meet with top brass at <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>.
And before the week was out, <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> had offered <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and his partner, <PERSON>Jon Peters</PERSON>, the most lucrative employment contracts in the history of the movie business.
Not only that, <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> also agreed to give them a stake in <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s future profits and buy their company, <ORGANIZATION>Guber Peters Entertainment Co.</ORGANIZATION>, for $200 million, almost 40% more than the market value of the company. 
Just seven months earlier, they had signed a five-year exclusive contract to make movies for <ORGANIZATION>Warner Bros.</ORGANIZATION> for which they had just produced the smash hit "Batman." But <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> figured that <ORGANIZATION>Warner Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON>Steven Ross</PERSON>, would empathize and let the producers go, knowing the <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> offer was "the culmination of a life's work." 
Last week, following fruitless settlement talks, <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>, now merging with <ORGANIZATION>Time Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, filed a $1 billion breach of contract suit in <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Superior Court</ORGANIZATION> against both <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Guber Peters</PERSON>.
<ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> promptly countersued, charging <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> with trying to sabotage its acquisitions and hurt its efforts to enter the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> movie business.
<PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> was raised in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> and educated in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> is a high-school dropout who came to fame as <PERSON>Barbra Streisand</PERSON>'s hairdresser.
That is a skill <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> badly needs -- and <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> is loath to lose. 
Although <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> had a good summer with "Ghostbusters II" and "When Harry Met Sally," rivals such as <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Paramount Pictures</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Walt Disney Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Universal Studios</ORGANIZATION> have been thrashing <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> at the box office.
<PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> aren't universally loved in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> but they are well connected.
Sometimes <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> do little more than grab the first draft of a screenplay for a "Flashdance," or buy rights to a best seller such as "The Color Purple." It falls to others to do the writing, directing and producing. 
<PERSON>Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peters</PERSON> had virtually nothing to do with day-to-day production, but their names still appear in big letters on the credits, and they are inevitably associated with its success.
In that case, <PERSON>Guber Peters</PERSON> acquired the rights in 1979, nursed the movie through a dozen scripts, and were on the set in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> for 11 months hovering over the most minute changes in casting and production. 
"They're the best production talent around," says <PERSON>Brian De Palma</PERSON>, beholden to <PERSON>Guber Peters</PERSON> for hiring him to direct the <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> movie of <PERSON>Tom Wolfe</PERSON>'s novel "Bonfire of the Vanities." On that film, which is to start shooting in a few months, "they've been very much involved, hiring talent and discussing the development of the script.
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> executives blame <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON>'s and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON>'s lack of involvement in "Caddyshack II" for casting and production problems and the film's ultimate dismal failure. "We've had a few bombs," admits <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON>. "But by and large this company has only been profitable." He says his company's prowess at packaging and marketing "is why we'll be good at <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>.
We practically ran our own studio." Longtime Hollywood associates describe <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> as the intellectual powerhouse of the two, a man with a flair for deal-making and marketing. "<PERSON>Peter</PERSON> is a major piece of <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> manpower who has really earned his success," says <PERSON>Robert Bookman</PERSON>, an agent at <ORGANIZATION>Creative Artists Agency</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON>, on the other hand, has fewer fans in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>, and his detractors like to characterize him as something of a hot-tempered bully.
Thrice married but now single, <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> got plenty of ink last summer for an on-set romance with actress <PERSON>Kim Basinger</PERSON> during the making of "Batman." <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON>, by contrast, has been married to one woman for more than 20 years.
But for all their intellectual and stylistic differences, they make the perfect "good cop, bad cop" team, <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> associates say. "<PERSON>Peter</PERSON> is the bright, sympathetic guy when you're doing a deal," says one agent. "If there's a problem, <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> disappears, and all of a sudden <PERSON>Jon</PERSON> shows up." 
<PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> rub many people in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> the wrong way.
Producers <PERSON>Don Simpson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jerry Bruckheimer</PERSON>, who shepherded "Flashdance" through several scripts and ultimately produced the movie, bristle when Messrs.
<PERSON>Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peters</PERSON> take credit for the film.
When <PERSON>Roger Birnbaum</PERSON>, an executive who worked for <PERSON>Guber Peters</PERSON> in the early 1980s, left to take a job as head of production at the <ORGANIZATION>United Artists</ORGANIZATION> studio, they made him forfeit all credits and financial interest in the films he had helped develop, including "Rainman" and "Batman." <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> acknowledges that and says it's not unlike the situation he and <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> are in with <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>. "I was upset with <PERSON>Roger</PERSON>, I fumpered and schmumpered," says <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON>. "But he wanted to pursue his own dream, and he went." 
Still, <PERSON>Mr. Birnbaum</PERSON> says his relationship with <PERSON>Guber Peters</PERSON> was "one of the most successful I've had in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>." The two "have a wonderful chemistry -- <PERSON>Jon</PERSON> is very impulsive, and <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> is very compulsive," adds <PERSON>Mr. Birnbaum</PERSON>, who is now head of production at <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's 20th <ORGANIZATION>Century Fox Film Co.</ORGANIZATION> "<PERSON>Jon Peters</PERSON> will come barreling into a room, say he's got a great idea, and be gone.
<PERSON>Mr. Birnbaum</PERSON> recalls that <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> shifted into high gear a few years back upon learning that they had competition for the story of the murdered naturalist <PERSON>Dian Fossey</PERSON>, which became "Gorillas in the Mist." He says, "Within a few weeks, we made deals with the government of <LOCATION>Rwanda</LOCATION> and everyone who had ever met or talked to <PERSON>Dian Fossey</PERSON>.
I think <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> even made some deals with the gorillas." <ORGANIZATION>Universal Studios</ORGANIZATION> was working on a competing film, but the studio and its producers ultimately agreed to co-produce the film with <PERSON>Guber Peters</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>. 
More recently, <PERSON>Guber Peters</PERSON> beat out a dozen other producers, reportedly including <PERSON>Robert Redford</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ted Turner</PERSON>, for rights to the life story of <PERSON>Chico Mendes</PERSON>, the murdered <LOCATION>Brazilian</LOCATION> union leader who fought developers in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> rain forest.
<PERSON>Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peters</PERSON> assiduously courted the man's widow for months, showing her a tape of "Gorillas in the Mist" to impress her with the quality of their work.
It's hardly astonishing (given the men's track record) that <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> wants <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON>.
But it is puzzling to some <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> executives that <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> rushed to hire them without clearing up the <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> situation first.
Some note that <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> might have saved itself some trouble by just hiring <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and letting <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> stay on to fulfill the <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> contract.
But though "people in town may ask why <PERSON>Guber</PERSON> needs <PERSON>Peters</PERSON>, it's good to have a partner, and obviously the chemistry works," says <PERSON>Steven Tisch</PERSON>, a producer who once worked for <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON>. "This business isn't about personalities at the end of the day -- its about whether the ink is red or black.
In the case of <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jon</PERSON>, the ink has been very, very black." 
<PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> got his start in the movie business at <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> two decades ago.
Recruited from <ORGANIZATION>New York University</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>MBA</ORGANIZATION> program, he rose within two years to head of production, overseeing such films as "The Way We Were," "Taxi Driver," "Tommy" and "Shampoo." In 1976, he teamed up with record producer <PERSON>Neil Bogart</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Casablanca Records</LOCATION> and Filmworks -- later called <LOCATION>Polygram Pictures</LOCATION> -- where they produced such hits as as "The Deep," and "Midnight Express." 
In 1980, <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> got together with <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON>, by then a successful producer in his own right, after the death of <PERSON>Mr. Bogart</PERSON>.
While <PERSON>Guber Peters</PERSON> produced a number of hits for <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> and others, their record wasn't always so impressive.
Among their clinkers were "The Legend of <PERSON>Billie Jean</PERSON>," "VisionQuest," "Clue" and "Clan of the Cave Bear." And the failures make it possible for <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> in its current lawsuit to paint the producers as ingrates.
<PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> replies that "this is a <LOCATION>Goliath</LOCATION>, this <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner</ORGANIZATION>, trying to chew up two fellows who have done only well for them for a long period of time." 
<PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> maintain that executives at <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> have always known of their ambitions to run a major entertainment powerhouse, but that <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> never felt threatened until they linked up with <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>. "From the beginning, {they} knew we had a goal and a dream," says <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON>.
On a number of occasions, he adds, he tried to get <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> to buy <PERSON>Guber Peters</PERSON> outright. "They always listened, but they never acted," <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> says. 
In 1987, <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> contributed their company's assets in exchange for a 28% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Barris Entertainment</ORGANIZATION>, a small-fry TV production company controlled by <ORGANIZATION>Giant Industries Inc</ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON>Burt Sugarman</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Guber</PERSON>, <PERSON>Peters</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sugarman</PERSON> made a $100 million offer to buy 25% of MGM/UA.
<PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> planned to run the nearly dormant <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION> studio, and the two even tried to interest <ORGANIZATION>Warner Bros.</ORGANIZATION> ' President <PERSON>Terry Semel</PERSON> in becoming a partner after he advised them on the deal. 
<PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> say they got a look at the books and balked at the price.
Last May, he sold his 24% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Barris</ORGANIZATION> to a passive Australian investor and <PERSON>Barris</PERSON> was renamed <ORGANIZATION>Guber Peters Entertainment Co</ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> had agreed to extend their <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> agreement with the new five-year exclusive contract. 
But it paled by comparison to what <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> was to offer last month: the chance, at last, to run a major studio, about $50 million in deferred compensation, up to 10% of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s future cash flow, 8% of the future appreciation of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s market value, and annual salaries of $2.7 million for each.
<ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> also agreed to indemnify the producers against any liability to <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> claim they have an oral agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> executives that allows them to terminate their contract should the opportunity to run a major studio arise.
But in affidavits filed yesterday in the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> court, <PERSON>Mr. Ross</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Warner Bros</ORGANIZATION>.
Chairman <PERSON>Robert Daly</PERSON> and President <PERSON>Semel</PERSON> deny that such an oral agreement was ever made.
<PERSON>Mr. Daly</PERSON> in his affidavit acknowledges that <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> agreed to release the producers last year to take over <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION> but says that situation was altogether different.
Moreover, the old contract was about to expire, and the lineup of <PERSON>Guber Peters</PERSON> pictures for <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> wasn't as strong as it is now.
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> itself was in negotiations with <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION> over certain movie and other rights, and it was "in <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>'s interest to accommodate MGM/UA, <PERSON>Guber</PERSON> and Peters by permitting them to become <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION> executives," <PERSON>Mr. Daly</PERSON> said in his affidavit. 
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> obviously doesn't think that it is in its own interests to let <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> go off to <LOCATION>Columbia</LOCATION>.
At the very least, <PERSON>Mr. Ross</PERSON> clearly sees an opportunity to use the two men to get a pound of flesh from <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>.
During settlement talks, for example, <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> demanded such things as cable TV rights to <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> movies and <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s interest in the studio it jointly owns with <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>, according to executives involved in the talks.
In any settlement, <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> is almost certain to demand rights to most of the 50 or so projects <PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> have locked up for the next few years, notably sequels to "Batman." 
<PERSON>Mr. Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON> refuse to concede that they may have made a tactical error in accepting the <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> offer before taking it up with <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>.
The last time <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Pictures</ORGANIZATION> was looking for a studio chief, they note, <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> released producer <PERSON>David Puttnam</PERSON> from his contract, then took him back after he was subsequently fired by his bosses at <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>.
In his affidavit filed yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Ross</PERSON> indicated he isn't buying any such argument: "If <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> succeeds here, no written contract in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> will be worth the paper it's written on." 
The British firm has begun court proceedings in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> to prevent the use of the name "Deloitte" by <PERSON>Deloitte</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Haskins & Sells</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Touche Ross & Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and the rest of the world.
The British Deloitte firm recently withdrew from the merger of <ORGANIZATION>Deloitte</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Touche</ORGANIZATION> world-wide and joined <ORGANIZATION>Coopers & Lybrand</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>John Bullock</PERSON>, senior partner of <ORGANIZATION>Deloitte</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION>, said "the decision to start these proceedings hasn't been taken lightly." <PERSON>Mr. Bullock</PERSON> said the British firm has used the name "Deloitte" since 1845.
In the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Deloitte, Haskins & Sells</ORGANIZATION> was known as <ORGANIZATION>Haskins & Sells</ORGANIZATION> until 1978, when it added the "Deloitte" name of its British affiliate. 
<PERSON>John C. Burton</PERSON>, an accounting professor at <ORGANIZATION>Columbia University</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Graduate School of Business</ORGANIZATION>, said "there's a lot of emotion involved in the name of an accounting firm with a long history and with roots in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, where accounting predates the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>" Although accountants aren't noted as "being deeply emotional, they really hold it all in," said <PERSON>Mr. Burton</PERSON>, former chief accountant of the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>J. Michael Cook</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Deloitte, Haskins & Sells International</ORGANIZATION>, said he believes the legal action by the British firm "to be without merit." <PERSON>Mr. Cook</PERSON> said that last June, the international executive committes of <ORGANIZATION>Deloitte</ORGANIZATION> and Touche agreed to a world-wide merger. "The merger is proceeding according to plan, except as to the withdrawal of the Deloitte U.K. firm," he said. 
Partners at other accounting firms say that the Deloitte firm in the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> is filing the suit to get even with the merged Deloitte-Touche firm for keeping major auditing work in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Deloitte</LOCATION> audit client, for example, has agreed to keep its annual $18 million world-wide audit and associated tax work with the merged Deloitte-Touche firm, to be known as <ORGANIZATION>Deloitte & Touche</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
In <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, this would mean that the <LOCATION>British Deloitte</LOCATION> would lose revenue for its audit of <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Vauxhill</ORGANIZATION> unit. 
The defection of <ORGANIZATION>Deloitte</ORGANIZATION>'s affiliates in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Coopers & Lybrand</ORGANIZATION> will make <ORGANIZATION>Coopers</ORGANIZATION> one of the biggest accounting firms in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, rivaling KPMG <PERSON>Peat Marwick</PERSON> there.
In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Harris Amhowitz</PERSON>, general counsel of <ORGANIZATION>Coopers</ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>Coopers</ORGANIZATION> "was aware of the litigation," but he declined further comment.
He also declined to comment on the name that <ORGANIZATION>Coopers</ORGANIZATION> would use in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> if <ORGANIZATION>Deloitte UK</ORGANIZATION> won its litigation to keep its name.
<ORGANIZATION>Coopers</ORGANIZATION> uses the <ORGANIZATION>Coopers & Lybrand</ORGANIZATION> name world-wide. 
The commission order named the following companies: <ORGANIZATION>Ticor Title Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, a unit of Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION>Ticor</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Title Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Safeco Title Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, units of <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Title & Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Lawyers Title Insurance Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Va.-based Universal Corp.</ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION>Stewart Title Guaranty Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of Houston-based <ORGANIZATION>Stewart Information Services Corp</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Title & Trust</ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION>Safeco</ORGANIZATION> in 1987 and changed the unit's name to <ORGANIZATION>Security Union Title Insurance Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>FTC</ORGANIZATION> ruled that the companies violated federal antitrust law by fixing rates in the following states: <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>John Christie</PERSON>, a lawyer here for the two <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Title & Trust</ORGANIZATION> units accused the <ORGANIZATION>FTC</ORGANIZATION> of "second-guessing" state-level regulations, with which, he said, his clients had complied. "I expect all the companies to appeal," he added. 
A lawyer for <ORGANIZATION>Lawyers Title</ORGANIZATION> said that, because the named companies no longer use the type of cooperative rating bureaus attacked by the <ORGANIZATION>FTC</ORGANIZATION>, the commission's order won't have much practical impact.
Rated Baa-2 by <ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and triple-B-minus by <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor's Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the issue will be sold through underwriters led by <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ORGANIZATION>.

<PERSON>Mr. Johnson</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Western Digital</ORGANIZATION>'s plant in <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> was affected by Hurricane Hugo, losing three days' production because of the storm, which wrecked much of the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> island's infrastructure.
He said <ORGANIZATION>Western Digital</ORGANIZATION> has reacted swiftly to the movement to video graphics array, <ORGANIZATION>VGA</ORGANIZATION>, graphics technology from the old enhanced graphics adapter, <ORGANIZATION>EGA</ORGANIZATION>, which has a lower resolution standard, technology and now is one of the leading producers of these newer units.
Next year <ORGANIZATION>Western Digital</ORGANIZATION> plans to consolidate its operations from 11 buildings in <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION> into two buildings in the same citya new headquarters and, a block away, a modern $100 million silicon wafer fabrication plant.
About half of <ORGANIZATION>Western Digital</ORGANIZATION>'s business is overseas, and <PERSON>Mr. Johnson</PERSON> expects that proportion to continue.
Plans to dissolve many of the trade barriers within <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> in 1992 creates significant opportunities for the company, he said, particularly since <ORGANIZATION>Western Digital</ORGANIZATION> already manufactures there.
Capitalizing on that presence, <ORGANIZATION>Western Digital</ORGANIZATION> is launching a major effort to develop the embryonic reseller market in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor's Corp.</ORGANIZATION> is reviewing debt issued by 12 <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> counties, and "there are potential isolated problems," said <PERSON>Hyman Grossman</PERSON>, a managing director.
<ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it is reviewing, with an eye toward a possible downgrade, the ratings on Bay View Federal bonds, long-term deposits and the preferred-stock rating of its parent company, <ORGANIZATION>Bay View Capital Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>University of Toronto</ORGANIZATION> stepped deeper into the contest for <ORGANIZATION>Connaught BioSciences Inc.</ORGANIZATION> by reaching an unusual agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Ciba-Geigy Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Chiron Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
Ciba-Geigy and <ORGANIZATION>Chiron</ORGANIZATION> have made a joint bid of C$866 million for Connaught, and <ORGANIZATION>Institut Merieux S.A.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> has made a rival bid of C$942 million.
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is seeking an injunction against the <ORGANIZATION>Merieux</ORGANIZATION> bid, arguing that <PERSON>Connaught</PERSON>'s predecessor company agreed in 1972 that <ORGANIZATION>Connaught</ORGANIZATION>'s ownership wouldn't be transferred to foreigners. 
It said the new agreement would "replace" the old one that forms the basis of its suit against the <ORGANIZATION>Merieux</ORGANIZATION> takeover. "Notwithstanding foreign ownership of Connaught, this accord would enhance research and development in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>," said <PERSON>James Keffer</PERSON>, the university's vice president of research. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ciba-Geigy</ORGANIZATION> is a <LOCATION>Swiss</LOCATION> pharmaceutical company and <ORGANIZATION>Chiron</ORGANIZATION> is based in <LOCATION>Emeryville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. 
In a statement, <PERSON>Jacques-Francois Martin</PERSON>, director general of <ORGANIZATION>Merieux</ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> company is still determined to acquire Connaught.
The <ORGANIZATION>Philanthropic Advisory Service</ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION>BBB</ORGANIZATION> reviews hundreds of new charities every year, measuring them against minimum standards for accountability; for accuracy and honesty in solicitation; and for percentage of funds actually going to work for which the charity was supposedly established.
On this basis, "there's no way the average person can know a good charity from a bad one," says <PERSON>David Ormstedt</PERSON>, an assistant attorney general in <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>. "A lot of donors just get taken." 
Including those, he contends, who put about $1 million into the kitty for the <ORGANIZATION>Connecticut Association of Concerned Veterans</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Vietnam Veterans Service Center</ORGANIZATION>.
The state has sued these charities in state court, complaining that much of the money was grossly misspent; 82%, says <PERSON>Mr. Ormstedt</PERSON>, went to fund raisers and most of the rest to the people who ran the charities and to their relatives -- for fur coats, trips to <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Lucullan</LOCATION> restaurant tabs.
The telephone number for the charity in <LOCATION>Shelton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, has been disconnected, and the former officials couldn't be located. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Arthritis Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>American Cancer Society</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>United Way of America</ORGANIZATION> all say that they spend roughly 90% of their income on programs, not overhead.
The state of <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> is suing the charity for fraud in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, along with <ORGANIZATION>Telesystems Marketing Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, its Houston-based fund raiser. 
<PERSON>Michael Burns</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Telesystems</ORGANIZATION>, says his concern has only benefited from the publicity surrounding the case, noting that three other charities have signed on as clients because they were impressed with the amount he raised for National Children's.
Attorneys general in several states, including <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, are already suing <ORGANIZATION>Watson & Hughey Co.</ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION>Alexandria</LOCATION>, Va.-based outfit that they say has used deceptive sweepstakes ads to solicit donations for the <ORGANIZATION>American Heart Disease Foundation</ORGANIZATION> and the Cancer Fund of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. 
According to the <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> attorney general's suit, <ORGANIZATION>Watson & Hughey</ORGANIZATION> sent mailings indicating that recipients were guaranteed cash prizes, and could win up to an additional $1,000 on top of them, if they contributed as little as $7.
"All too often this will merely be a statement on the solicitation such as, `Don't smoke!' or `Wear suntan lotion, ' " says <PERSON>William Webster</PERSON>, attorney general of <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>. "By putting these pithy statements on the solicitations, hundreds of thousands of dollars are claimed to have been spent on education to consumers when in fact this represents the costs of sending the newsletters." 
<PERSON>Mr. Webster</PERSON> cites a four-page mailing from the <ORGANIZATION>United Cancer Council</ORGANIZATION> that offers a chance to win $5,000 in gold bullion to those giving as little as $5 to cancer education. "A few boilerplate warnings about cancer appear but that's only two inches in all four pages.
A couple in <LOCATION>Rockford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, raised $12,591 earlier this year using the name and logo of <ORGANIZATION>Mothers Against Drunk Driving</ORGANIZATION>, without permission from the group.

<PERSON>Melvin Belli</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> law offices may have been the epicenter of legal activity after Tuesday's earthquake. 
<PERSON>Mr. Belli</PERSON>, like many other personal-injury lawyers, suspects that the earthquake, which measured 6.9 on the <PERSON>Richter</PERSON> scale, will generate enough lawsuits to keep this city's personal-injury and construction lawyers busy for quite some time.
For now, says <PERSON>Laurence Drivon</PERSON>, president-elect of the 6,000-member <ORGANIZATION>California Trial Lawyers Association</ORGANIZATION>, "the last thing we really need to worry about is whether anybody is going to get sued, or whether they have liability or not.
"My prediction is there will be mass litigation over errors and omissions in engineering and contracting," says <PERSON>Stanley Chesley</PERSON>, a well-known <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> plaintiffs lawyer.
From what he saw on television, <PERSON>Mr. Chesley</PERSON> points out that <ORGANIZATION>Interstate</ORGANIZATION> 880, which collapsed and killed more than 200 commuters, suffered serious damage while surrounding buildings appeared to sustain no damage whatsoever.
The flamboyant and publicity-conscious <PERSON>Mr. Belli</PERSON> says he already has investigators looking into who could be held liable for the damage on the <LOCATION>Bay Bridge</LOCATION> and the interstate approaching it. "We won't know until the smoke clears -- but yes, we're looking into it," he says. 
Defense lawyers, perhaps understandably, say that plaintiffs' lawyers taking such an approach will have little success in pursuing their claims, though they add that the facts of each case must be looked at individually. "A lot of this is going to be code-related," says <PERSON>Ignazio J. Ruvolo</PERSON>, a construction law specialist at <ORGANIZATION>Bronson</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Bronson & McKinnon</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> law firm.
But if defendants can prove that they met <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s stringent building codes, "that's probably going to protect them," <PERSON>Mr. Ruvolo</PERSON> says. 
Government entities, continues <PERSON>Mr. Ruvolo</PERSON>, could be protected by the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Government Tort Liability Act.
Built into the statute are so-called design immunities, which are likely to protect government agencies, according to <PERSON>Mr. Ruvolo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Richard Covert</PERSON>, a lawyer with the <ORGANIZATION>California Department of Transportation</ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the damaged <LOCATION>Bay Bridge</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Covert</PERSON> had to search through law books scattered on the floor of his office yesterday, and <PERSON>Mr. Belli</PERSON>'s courtyard was strewn with bricks.
<ORGANIZATION>Bell Atlantic Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southern New England Telecommunications</ORGANIZATION> posted strong profit gains for the third quarter, while <ORGANIZATION>Nynex Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Telesis Group and U S West Inc.</ORGANIZATION> reported earnings declines for the period. 
Rate settlements in <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> depressed <ORGANIZATION>U S West</ORGANIZATION>'s third-quarter profit.
Denver-based <ORGANIZATION>U S West</ORGANIZATION> said net income dropped 8.9%, noting that the year-ago quarter included the sale of a building by its <ORGANIZATION>BetaWest Properties</ORGANIZATION> unit. 
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Bell Atlantic</ORGANIZATION> closed at $100.625, up $1.50 a share. 
At <ORGANIZATION>Nynex</ORGANIZATION>, net slumped 14.8%, primarily because of a continuing strike by 60,000 employees, lower-than-expected profit at its <ORGANIZATION>New York Telephone</ORGANIZATION> unit and significantly higher taxes and costs. 
"Our net income isn't where we would want it to be at this point," said <PERSON>William C. Ferguson</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer. "This deviation from our past growth patterns is caused largely by lower earnings at <LOCATION>New York Telephone</LOCATION>." 
<PERSON>Mr. Ferguson</PERSON> said a continued softness in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> area's economy and increased competition, particularly in the private-line market, took a heavy toll on earnings. 
In <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Nynex</ORGANIZATION> common closed at $81.125, up $1.625. 
<PERSON>Walter H. Monteith Jr.</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>SNET</ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer, said: "Innovative marketing of our products and services contributed to increase revenue." 
<ORGANIZATION>SNET</ORGANIZATION> common rose $1.25 to $85.50 a share yesterday in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>. 
Revenue was reduced $33 million by three extraordinary items: a <ORGANIZATION>California Public Utilities Commission</ORGANIZATION> refund for an <ORGANIZATION>American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ORGANIZATION> billing adjustment; a provision for productivity sharing to be paid to customers in 1990 and a one-time accrual for a toll settlement with long-distance telephone companies. 
In <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Telesis</ORGANIZATION> common closed at $45.50, up 87.5 cents. 
a-Includes a one-time gain of $88.7 million from a commonstock sale by <ORGANIZATION>U S West's U S West New Vector Group</ORGANIZATION>. b-Includes a $41.3 million gain on the sale of <ORGANIZATION>FiberCom</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>MC SHIPPING Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, declared an initial quarterly of 60 cents a share payable Nov. 15 to shares of record Oct. 30.
But two big <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> banks seem to have kicked those chances away, for the moment, with the embarrassing failure of <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Chase Manhattan Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to deliver $7.2 billion in bank financing for a leveraged buy-out of <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
Those expanded powers reached their zenith in July when <ORGANIZATION>Bankers Trust New York Corp.</ORGANIZATION> provided mergers advice, an equity investment and bank loans for the $3.65 billion leveraged buy-out of <ORGANIZATION>Northwest Airlines</ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION>NWA Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
One of the major selling points used by <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> financier <PERSON>Alfred Checchi</PERSON> in getting the takeover approved was that the deal didn't include any junk bonds.
<PERSON>Charles Nathan</PERSON>, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, says it is natural for banks to try to expand beyond their bread-and-butter business of providing senior debt for buy-outs.
<PERSON>David Batchelder</PERSON>, a mergers adviser in <LOCATION>La Jolla</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, who aided <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON> on the bids which put both <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NWA</ORGANIZATION> in play as takeover candidates this year, says that banks have been "preparing to play a larger and larger role in acquisition financing." 
<PERSON>Mr. Checchi</PERSON>'s purchase of <ORGANIZATION>NWA</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Batchelder</PERSON> notes, "was probably the most aggressive to date," with bank debt at 85% of the purchase price. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Batchelder</PERSON> says that <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>'s "failure to deliver" on its promise to raise the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> bank debt for a labor-management buy-out group "is very distressing to potential users of a `highly-confident' letter from commercial banks." His client, <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON>, used just such a letter from <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> in pursuing <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> later agreed to work with a competing <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> buy-out group. 
Executives of <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Chase Manhattan</ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on either the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> situation, or on the changing nature of banks' role in financing takeovers. 
<PERSON>Mark Solow</PERSON>, senior managing director at <ORGANIZATION>Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION>, says the falloff in junk bonds may yet open new business opportunities to banks in structuring takeovers.
<PERSON>James B. Lee</PERSON>, head of syndications and private placements at <ORGANIZATION>Chemical Banking Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said he believes banks can still make a credible offer of one-stop shopping for takeover finance.
As evidence, he cites yesterday's arrangement for the final financing of a $3 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION>American Medical International Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in which <ORGANIZATION>Chemical</ORGANIZATION> served as both the lead bank and an equity investor. 
<PERSON>Arthur Fleischer Jr.</PERSON>, a takeover lawyer at <ORGANIZATION>Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson</ORGANIZATION>, notes that "a political and emotional bias" has developed against junk bonds. 
One hostile bidder who deliberately avoided using junk bonds was <ORGANIZATION>Paramount Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in its initial offer to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Time Inc.</ORGANIZATION> for $10.7 billion, or $175 a share.
But some observers believe <ORGANIZATION>Paramount</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Martin Davis</PERSON> wanted to avoid the possible taint of being perceived as a corporate raider in his controversial bid for Time.
In the end, <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON> used junk bonds so that he could raise <ORGANIZATION>Paramount</ORGANIZATION>'s bid to $200 a share.
Time eluded <ORGANIZATION>Paramount</ORGANIZATION> by acquiring <ORGANIZATION>Warner Communications Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
The success of the <ORGANIZATION>NWA</ORGANIZATION> financing, and the failure of the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> deal, also seem to highlight the important new role in takeover financing being played by Japanese banks. 
Japanese banks accounted for 50% of the <ORGANIZATION>NWA</ORGANIZATION> bank debt, according to a report by <ORGANIZATION>Transportation</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Samuel Skinner</PERSON>.
But it was broad-scale rejection by Japanese banks that helped seal the fate of the attempt to buy <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Chase</PERSON> are attempting to put together a new, lower bid. 
<PERSON>Takanori Mizuno</PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION>Institute for Financial Affairs Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> research center on finance and economics, says, "The junk bond market became very jittery, and there's a fear of a coming recession and the possible bankruptcy of <ORGANIZATION>LBO</ORGANIZATION> companies.
"Profits at Christmas could be under attack for every retailer," asserts <PERSON>Norman Abramson</PERSON>, president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION>Clothestime Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, an off-price chain. 
<ORGANIZATION>Management Horizons</ORGANIZATION> forecasts a 1.4% profit decline for non-auto retailers this year, after annual drops that averaged 4.5% in 1988 and 1987. "For the last two and a half years, retailing has been in a mild recession," says <PERSON>Carl Steidtmann</PERSON>, chief economist at the <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, consulting firm. 
This year, many stores are entering the Christmas season in turmoil: <ORGANIZATION>Bonwit Teller</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>B. Altman</PERSON> parent <ORGANIZATION>L.J. Hooker Corp.</ORGANIZATION> is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal <ORGANIZATION>Bankruptcy Code; B.A.T Industries PLC</ORGANIZATION>'s healthy Saks Fifth Avenue and <ORGANIZATION>Marshall Field</ORGANIZATION>'s chains are on the auction block; <ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale</ORGANIZATION>'s is also on the block. 
Stores in a state of confusion are likely to fare poorly, and to lose customers to stable chains such as <ORGANIZATION>Limited Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, May <ORGANIZATION>Department Stores Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Dillard Department Stores Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which should do well. 
"There are going to be very clear winners and very clear losers," says <PERSON>Cynthia Turk</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Touche Ross & Co.</ORGANIZATION> retail consultant. 
"Traditionally, consumers were concerned about ordering after the first of December because they didn't believe they would get it by Christmas," says <PERSON>Adam Strum</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Wine Enthusiast Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which sells wine cellars and accessories through the mail.
Using <ORGANIZATION>Federal Express</ORGANIZATION> delivery last year, <PERSON>Mr. Strum</PERSON> says, "December was our biggest month." 
Even <ORGANIZATION>Sears, Roebuck & Co.</ORGANIZATION> is getting into the act, offering for the first time to have <ORGANIZATION>Federal Express</ORGANIZATION> deliver toys ordered by Dec. 20 from its Wish Book catalog. 
<ORGANIZATION>K mart Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON>Joseph E. Antonini</PERSON> summed up his outlook for the Christmas season as "not troublesome." He's not predicting a blockbuster, but he is "more optimistic than three months ago" because employment remains strong and inflation low. 
<PERSON>Philip M. Hawley</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, expects sales at department stores open at least a year to rise a modest 3% to 5% over last year's totals, both for his company and the industry in general. "I'm not looking for a runaway Christmas at all," he says. 
"It isn't a real boom holiday season in our eyes," says <ORGANIZATION>Woolworth Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON>Harold E. Sells</PERSON>, "but it isn't going to be a bust either." Mr. Sells expects fourth-quarter sales at his company -- which besides <PERSON>Woolworth</PERSON> stores includes <LOCATION>Kinney</LOCATION> and Foot Locker shoe stores and other specialty chains -- to rise "pretty much in line" with its year-to-date increases of between 8% and 9%.
A consumer poll conducted in early September by <ORGANIZATION>Leo J. Shapiro & Associates</ORGANIZATION>, a market researcher based in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, also suggests a modest holiday.
But many consumers probably will use the extra time to put off some purchasing until the last minute. "What you'll hear as we get into December is that sales are sluggish," predicts <ORGANIZATION>Woolworth</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Sells</PERSON>. "The week ending the 24th is going to save the entire month for everyone." 
<PERSON>Mr. Chan</PERSON> used to be an oddity in <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION>: a private entrepreneur.
He rejoined his family in January 1984 and began the long struggle for justice, pressing everyone from <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION> municipal officials to <ORGANIZATION>National Assembly</ORGANIZATION> deputies for restoration of his rights.
<PERSON>Nguyen Ngoc</PERSON> seemed an obvious choice when the <ORGANIZATION>Vietnamese Writers Association</ORGANIZATION> was looking for a new editor to reform its weekly newspaper, <LOCATION>Van Nghe</LOCATION>. 
Appointed editor in chief in July 1987, <PERSON>Mr. Ngoc</PERSON> rapidly turned the staid Van Nghe into <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s hottest paper. 
The newspaper also ran a series of controversial short stories by <PERSON>Nguyen Huy Thiep</PERSON>, a former history teacher, who stirred debate over his interpretation of <LOCATION>Vietnamese</LOCATION> culture and took a thinly veiled swipe at writers who had blocked his entry into their official association. 
"Under <PERSON>Mr. Ngoc</PERSON>, Van Nghe protected the people instead of the government," says <PERSON>Nguyen Duy</PERSON>, a poet who is the paper's bureau chief for southern <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. "The paper reflected the truth.
<PERSON>Nguyen Thi Thi</PERSON> is <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s entrepreneur of the 1980s.
A lifelong revolutionary with little education who fought both the <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> and the U.S.-backed <PERSON>Saigon</PERSON> regime, she switched effortlessly to commerce after the war.
As she rode over regulations, only her friendship with party leaders, including <PERSON>Nguyen Van Linh</PERSON>, then <LOCATION>Ho Chi Minh City</LOCATION> party secretary, kept her out of jail. 
Following <PERSON>Mr. Linh</PERSON>'s appointment as secretary-general of the party at the sixth congress, <PERSON>Mrs. Thi</PERSON> has become the darling of "doi moi", the <LOCATION>Vietnamese</LOCATION> version of perestroika.
In recent years, <PERSON>Mrs. Thi</PERSON> has started to diversify the company, taking a 20% stake in newly established, partly private Industrial and <ORGANIZATION>Commercial Bank</ORGANIZATION>, and setting up <ORGANIZATION>Saigon Petro</ORGANIZATION>, which owns and operates <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s first oil refinery. 
<PERSON>Mrs. Thi</PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION>Hochiminh City Food</ORGANIZATION> last year increased pretax profit 60% to the equivalent of about $2.7 million on sales of $150 million.
She is almost cavalier about the possibility <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s reforms will create rivals on her home turf. "I don't mind the competition inside the country," she says. "I am only afraid that with <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s poor-quality products we can't compete with neighboring countries." 
The <LOCATION>Little Rock</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>, department-store retailer said proceeds will be used to reduce short-term debt.
<PERSON>Peter Isler</PERSON>, the winning navigator in the past two <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s Cup challenges, has split from the team led by <PERSON>Dennis Conner</PERSON>, skipper of the victorious <ORGANIZATION>Stars & Stripes</ORGANIZATION>, to form his own team for the next contest in 1992.
<ORGANIZATION>Isler Sailing International</ORGANIZATION>'s advisory board includes <PERSON>Ted Turner</PERSON>, <PERSON>Turner Broadcasting</PERSON> chairman and a former Cup victor; <PERSON>Peter G. Diamandis</PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION>Diamandis Communications</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Joseph B. Vittoria</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Avis Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
His steering committee includes other notable businessmen, including the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> investor and old salt <PERSON>Roy E. Disney</PERSON>. 
The split comes in the midst of a court battle over whether the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Yacht Club</ORGANIZATION> should be allowed to keep the international trophy for sailing a catamaran against the <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> challengers' 90-foot monohull.
In September, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> appellate court overturned a state judge's ruling that awarded the Cup to the <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> team. 
Pending an appeal by the <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> team, led by <PERSON>Michael Fay</PERSON>, the finals for the next Cup challenge are scheduled to be held in mid-1992 in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>.
"If you don't know what the rules of the game are, it's hard to start your fund-raising or design," said <PERSON>Dana Smith</PERSON>, an official with <PERSON>Team Dennis Conner</PERSON>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Conner</ORGANIZATION> team won't be able to negotiate with corporate sponsors until the suit is resolved and the race site is determined, <PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON> said, and the syndicate's budget could easily reach $30 million. 
But spokesmen for both <PERSON>Mr. Isler</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Conner</PERSON> say the formation of the new syndicate has to do with <PERSON>Mr. Isler</PERSON>'s desire to skipper his own team and begin planning now, rather than any falling out between the two sportsmen.
<PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON> and a spokesman for the <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s Cup <ORGANIZATION>Organizing Committee</ORGANIZATION> insist that the added competition for the defender's spot will only improve the race. 
"That is a minimum figure, and I underscore minimum," said <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON>Thomas Foley</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>) after conferring with <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> lawmakers. "It's impossible to put an exact figure on it at this time." 
And <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s 45-member delegation in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> is expected to propose that emergency funds be added to a stop-gap spending bill that the <ORGANIZATION>House Appropriations Committee</ORGANIZATION> is to consider Monday. 
One of the last big employers in the <LOCATION>Silicon Valley</LOCATION> to report in, <ORGANIZATION>Seagate Technology</ORGANIZATION>, said it expects to be back at full strength Monday.
Echoing the response of almost all big corporations in the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Don Waite</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Seagate</ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer, said, "I wouldn't expect this to have any significant financial impact." 
The closed branches, in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hayward</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Santa Clara</PERSON> and <PERSON>Santa Cruz</PERSON>, sustained structural damage.
Securities-trading operations were moved to <ORGANIZATION>Bank of America</ORGANIZATION>'s Concord office, and foreign-exchange trading operations were shifted to <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, the bank said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Wells Fargo & Co.</ORGANIZATION> said its <ORGANIZATION>Emergency Operations Committee</ORGANIZATION> -- which met all night Tuesday -- moved its global-funds transfer system to <LOCATION>El Monte</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, 500 miles to the <LOCATION>south</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Santa Clara County</LOCATION> has a running total so far of $504 million, excluding the hard-hit city of <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Oakland</ORGANIZATION> officials were still uncertain about the magnitude of structural damage late yesterday; a section of I-880, a twotiered highway, collapsed in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, causing a majority of the deaths resulting from the quake. 
That includes dwellings in the ravaged <LOCATION>Marina</LOCATION> district that must be demolished, peeled business facades south of Market Street, and houses in the city's outer <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> district that were heaved off their foundations.
The federal funds would go to a range of programs, including the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Emergency Management Agency</ORGANIZATION>, highway construction accounts and the <ORGANIZATION>Small Business Administration</ORGANIZATION>, according to Rep. <PERSON>Vic Fazio</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>). 
<ORGANIZATION>FEMA</ORGANIZATION>, which coordinates federal disaster relief, is already strapped by the costs of cleaning up after Hurricane Hugo, which hit the <LOCATION>Carolinas</LOCATION> last month.
It is likely to get as much as $800 million initially in additional funds, and eventually could get more than $1 billion, according to <PERSON>Mr. Fazio</PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION>House Appropriations Committee</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON> said there is enough money on hand to deal with immediate requirements.
The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration has at its disposal $273 million in funds remaining from the $1.1 billion <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> released for the cleanup after Hurricane Hugo. 
He added that the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Management and Budget</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION> and other agencies are "developing longer-term legislation" that should be ready soon. 
Those changes also would apply to two areas hit hard by Hurricane Hugo -- <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>U.S. Virgin Islands</LOCATION>, according to an aide to Rep. <PERSON>Fazio</PERSON>. 
Some 250,000 cars normally cross the closed Bay Bridge between <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> daily.
Even so, "We're looking for chaos," said <PERSON>George Gray</PERSON>, a deputy district director at the <ORGANIZATION>California Department of Transportation</ORGANIZATION>. "If there's any way you can do it, you ought to go to <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> and go fishing for a while." 
Most of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s tourists and business travelers already have left -- despite hotel's offers of rate cuts. "Everyone left," said <PERSON>Peter Lang</PERSON>, reservations manager of the <ORGANIZATION>Mark Hopkins Hotel</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Westin St. Francis</ORGANIZATION> hotel, which survived the 1906 earthquake and fire, currently is less than 50% occupied. "We still have our die-hard baseball fans," a spokesman said. "One lady from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> said she's not going home until the {World Series} is over." 
<PERSON>Gerald F. Seib</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joe Davidson</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> contributed to this article. 
A <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> arbitration panel ordered <PERSON>Dean Witter</PERSON> to pay $404,294 in back bonuses to <PERSON>William Kelly</PERSON>, the company's former head of high-yield, high-risk junk-bond trading and sales.
<PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> and <PERSON>Newcomb</PERSON> represent bonuses the two men said they deserved from the first half of 1988, but which weren't paid because of a dispute over an incentive contract. 
<PERSON>Jeffrey L. Liddle</PERSON>, the two men's attorney at <LOCATION>Liddle</LOCATION>, <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Finkelstein & Robinson</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Mr. Kelly</PERSON> began working at <ORGANIZATION>Dean Witter</ORGANIZATION> in 1987.
<PERSON>Dean Witter</PERSON> lost a separate case involving a former bond executive earlier this year; in August it paid $666,666 in back pay and a bonus to a former corporate-bond trading chief, <PERSON>Harold Bachman</PERSON>.
A spokesman for <PERSON>Dean Witter</PERSON>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Sears, Roebuck & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, declined to comment. 
Suffering from a downturn in heavy truck production that cut orders for its engines, <ORGANIZATION>Caterpillar</ORGANIZATION> also said it will indefinitely lay off about 325 workers in the <LOCATION>Peoria</LOCATION> area and temporarily shut its plant in <LOCATION>York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, for two weeks in both November and December. 
In a report on <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s foundering economy, the official <ORGANIZATION>State Statistical Bureau</ORGANIZATION> disclosed that industrial output last month rose 0.9% from a year earlier-the lowest growth rate in a decade for September.
Chinese and foreign economists now predict prolonged stagflation: low growth and high inflation. "The economy is crashing hard," says an <LOCATION>Asian</LOCATION> economist in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>. "The slowdown is taking hold a lot more quickly and devastatingly than anyone had expected." 
One sign of a possible easing of credit policy was the decision this week of <ORGANIZATION>People's Bank of China</ORGANIZATION>, the central bank, to allocate $5.4 billion in short-term loans to pay farmers for the autumn harvest, the official <ORGANIZATION>China Daily</ORGANIZATION> reported. 
Output declined in several provinces, including <LOCATION>Jiangsu</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Zhejiang</PERSON>, two key coastal areas, and <PERSON>Sichuan</PERSON>, the nation's agricultural breadbasket.
Production in <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s industrial powerhouse and the largest source of tax revenue for the central government, fell 1.8% for the month. 
After years of quarreling over <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION>'s "Ostpolitik", <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> appear to have shifted onto a united course in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> have taken a leading role in aid for the reformist countries, pledging billions of dollars in fresh credit and forgiving old debt while urging other industrial nations to follow suit.
Both hope to encourage pressure for change in <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> bloc countries still ruled by Stalinist holdouts by arranging liberal financial aid and trade benefits for <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> and, to a lesser extent, the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
"The change taking place in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> has aroused new hope in both <LOCATION>German</LOCATION> states that reforms will be undertaken in {<LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>}, and that relations between the two <LOCATION>German</LOCATION> states, too, will get better," said Foreign Minister <PERSON>Hans-Dietrich Genscher</PERSON>. 
Addressing a conference of the New York-based <ORGANIZATION>Institute for East-West Security Studies</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> yesterday, <PERSON>Mr. Genscher</PERSON> said, "History will judge us by whether we have taken the opportunities that emerge from these reforms." The ultimate aim of Western support for East bloc reforms, he said, is to create "an equitable and stable peaceful order in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> from the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> to the Urals." 
<PERSON>Mr. Genscher</PERSON> and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Secretary of <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> <PERSON>Robert A. Mosbacher</PERSON>, in separate speeches at the conference, appealed for more Western contributions to economic reforms and business development in <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> are leading supporters of <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>'s request for a $1 billion stand-by credit from the <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION>. 
"We want the bold programs of market development and political freedom in <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> and in <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> to succeed.
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> curbs on the exports of sensitive technology to <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> bloc countries will remain in place, however. 
Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> yesterday approved an $837.5 million aid package for <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> that more than doubles the amount President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> had requested.
The package was brought to the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> just 15 days after it was introduced, indicating <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>'s eagerness to reward <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> for their moves toward democracy and freemarket economic reforms. 
The legislation, approved 345-47 and sent to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, establishes two enterprise funds, to be governed by independent nonprofit boards, which will make loans and investments in new business ventures in <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>.
In addition, a group of 24 industrialized countries, including the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and coordinated by the <ORGANIZATION>European Community Commission</ORGANIZATION>, has promised <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> trade advice and a line of credit equivalent to $1.11 billion through the <ORGANIZATION>European Investment Bank</ORGANIZATION>, while the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> plans $222 million in direct aid. 
When Chancellor <PERSON>Helmut Kohl</PERSON> travels to <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> Nov. 9, he is expected to take with him a promise of three billion West German marks ($1.6 billion) in new credit guarantees for industrial projects.
<LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> also has increased its credit guarantees to <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> by 500 million marks to 1.5 billion marks as the emerging <ORGANIZATION>democratic state</ORGANIZATION> rushes through its own economic reforms, including a broad privatization of state-owned industry and tax incentives for industrial investment.
An additional 500 million marks in credit-backing was promised by the West German state governments of <LOCATION>Bavaria</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Baden-Wuerttemberg</PERSON>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Deutsche Bank AG</ORGANIZATION>, which last year arranged a three billion mark credit for the <ORGANIZATION>Soviet Union</ORGANIZATION>, is now moving to become the first West German bank to set up independent business offices in <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> as they shift to free-market economies.
A maxim of <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> banking holds that wherever <ORGANIZATION>Deutsche Bank</ORGANIZATION> goes, other West German banks follow.
<ORGANIZATION>Harley-Davidson</ORGANIZATION>'s complaint claims that the group, led by investor <PERSON>Malcolm I. Glazer</PERSON>, violated securities laws by failing to disclose plans to purchase 15% of the company's shares outstanding and that when the required <ORGANIZATION>Hart-Scott-Rodino</ORGANIZATION> filing eventually was made, it didn't disclose the group's alleged earlier violation of the so-called prior-notice requirements of the law. 
But when <PERSON>Harley</PERSON> last week publicly questioned the legality of the group's filing procedures, the <LOCATION>Rochester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, investor said "we complied with every law," and he denied any wrongdoing. 
The Glazer group said in a <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> filing in early October that it may seek a controlling interest in <LOCATION>Harley-Davidson</LOCATION>, or seek representation on the company's board.
That news, plus recent signs of economic sluggishness, greatly increases pressure on the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> to ease credit further, which in turn would be good news for stocks, investment managers say. "I see a lot of evidence indicating a slower economy, and that means my interest-rate outlook has a downward tilt," said <PERSON>Garnett L. Keith Jr.</PERSON>, vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Prudential Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, one of the nation's largest institutional investors.
<ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> officials probably won't drive down rates immediately, <PERSON>Mr. Keith</PERSON> said.
"We're not out of the woods yet by any means," said <PERSON>George R. Mateyo</PERSON>, president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Carnegie Capital Management Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Ko Shioya</PERSON> spent eight years as the editor in chief of the Japanese edition of Reader's Digest. "<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> has been a major importer of foreign information and news," says <PERSON>Mr. Shioya</PERSON>. "But one gets fed up with importing information and news." 
Printed in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and carrying the line "The Insider's <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>," Business <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s October cover story was "The World's No. 1 Customer" -- Japanese women. 
<PERSON>Keizaikai</PERSON> is one of a small but growing band of Japanese companies taking their first steps into <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> publishing, after making major investments in entertainment, real estate and banking companies here.
Japanese concerns have retained a number of publishing consultants and media brokers to study the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market, including the New York-based investment banker <PERSON>Veronis</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Suhler & Associates</ORGANIZATION>.
"Japanese publishers want to be introduced to the publishing and information industries," said <PERSON>John Veronis</PERSON>, chairman of <PERSON>Veronis Suhler</PERSON>.
While there aren't any major deals in the works currently on the scale of <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's recent $3.4 billion agreement to buy <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, observers don't rule out a transaction of that size. "The Japanese take the long view." said <PERSON>Mr. Veronis</PERSON>. "It may not be weeks or months, but they are also opportunistic and if they feel comfortable, they will move on a deal," he said. 
In recent months, three big Tokyo-based publishing concerns -- including <ORGANIZATION>Nikkei Business Publications</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Nikkei Home</ORGANIZATION> (no relation), and <ORGANIZATION>Magazine House</ORGANIZATION> -- applied for membership in <ORGANIZATION>Magazine Publishers of America</ORGANIZATION>, which represents almost all <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> consumer magazines. 
Japanese involvement in <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> publishing has been so small to date that magazines such as Business <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> are considered groundbreakers.
When <PERSON>Keizaikai</PERSON> launched <ORGANIZATION>Business Tokyo</ORGANIZATION> in 1987, it appealed to a more multinational audience.
The magazine was overhauled with the aid of American magazine design gurus <PERSON>Milton Glaser</PERSON> and <PERSON>Walter Bernard</PERSON>, and targets top-level <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> executives with Japanese and <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> advertisers. 
<PERSON>Susumu Ohara</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Nihon Keizai Shinbun America Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, publisher of the <ORGANIZATION>Japan Economic Journal</ORGANIZATION>, said he receives telephone calls weekly from media bankers on whether his parent company is interested in buying a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> consumer or business magazine. 
"The Japanese are in the early stage right now," said <PERSON>Thomas Kenney</PERSON>, a onetime media adviser for <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp.</ORGANIZATION> who was recently appointed president of <ORGANIZATION>Reader's Digest Association</ORGANIZATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION>Magazine Publishing Group</ORGANIZATION>. "Before, they were interested in hard assets and they saw magazines as soft.
But a <ORGANIZATION>House Energy and Commerce</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee will quiz <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Breeden</PERSON> Wednesday, and <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Brady</PERSON> will go before the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Banking</ORGANIZATION> panel Thursday. 
It may also expedite the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>'s modest pending changes in junk-bond disclosure rules and intensify the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>'s look at plans for giving new tax breaks on dividends and raising taxes on short-term trades by pension funds. 
<PERSON>Brady</PERSON> and <PERSON>Breeden</PERSON> work well together on the plunge, despite the fact that the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> secretary opposed <PERSON>Breeden</PERSON>'s nomination to the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> post. 
BAKER FALTERS in the <LOCATION>Mideast</LOCATION> amid <LOCATION>Israeli</LOCATION> paralysis and <LOCATION>Palestinian</LOCATION> politics. 
Despite seeing his plan for Israeli-Palestinian elections wither, the cautious secretary of state is so far unwilling to cut <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economic or military aid to force <LOCATION>Israeli</LOCATION> cooperation.
Baker nonetheless remains furious both at <LOCATION>Shamir</LOCATION>, for backing down on the elections, and at <PERSON>Shamir</PERSON>'s rival, <PERSON>Peres</PERSON>, for political ineptitude in forcing a premature cabinet vote on <PERSON>Baker</PERSON>'s plan. 
Meanwhile, some <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials fear <ORGANIZATION>PLO</ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON>Arafat</PERSON> is getting cold feet and may back off from his recent moderation and renunciation of terrorism.
He is under intense fire from other <LOCATION>Palestinian</LOCATION> groups; <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION> is pushing <PERSON>Ahmad Jibril</PERSON>, whose terrorist band is blamed for the <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> 103 bombing, as an alternative to <PERSON>Arafat</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Darman</PERSON> now blames the clash on miscommunication, but <ORGANIZATION>House GOP</ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON>Michel</PERSON>, who carried the offer to him, observes, "I was speaking English at the time, and quite loud so I could be understood." 
<ORGANIZATION>Senate GOP</ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON>Dole</PERSON> ridicules the budget chief on the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> floor.
Democratic counterpart <PERSON>Mitchell</PERSON>, asked to interpret <PERSON>Darman</PERSON>'s threat to make permanent the across-the-board Gramm-Rudman cuts that took effect this week, says, "I don't even bother to interpret them." 
<ORGANIZATION>HHS OFFICIALS</ORGANIZATION> expect Secretary <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> to continue a ban on research using fetal tissue. 
COOPERATION WANES on weapons development between the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> pull out of a proposal to build new <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> frigates; the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> have each withdrawn from missile projects.
BOTH SIDES NOW: <ORGANIZATION>Virginia GOP</ORGANIZATION> lieutenant governor candidate <PERSON>Eddy Dalton</PERSON> tries to have it both ways on the abortion issue.
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has three vacancies to fill on the prestigious <ORGANIZATION>D.C. Circuit Court</ORGANIZATION>, which handles many important regulatory issues and is often considered a warm-up for future <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> nominees.
One slot is expected to go to <ORGANIZATION>EEOC</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Clarence Thomas</PERSON>, a black conservative; after mulling a fight, liberals now probably won't put up a major struggle against him. 
Other conservatives thought to be on the administration's short list include <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON>Michael Uhlmann</PERSON>, who was passed over for the No. 2 job at the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Marshall Breger</PERSON>, chairman of a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> agency on administration. 
The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration would also like to nominate a woman; one possibility is former <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON>Victoria Toensing</PERSON>. 
MINOR MEMOS: In the wake of the failed <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> coup, a bumper sticker appears: "Ollie Would Have Got Him." . . . Rep. <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON>, on trial for bribery and extortion, puts statements in the <ORGANIZATION>Congressional Record</ORGANIZATION> attributing missed votes to "scheduling conflicts." . . . A <ORGANIZATION>GOP Senate</ORGANIZATION> fund-raising letter from <PERSON>Sen. Burns</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> is made to appear personally written, and its opening line is, "Please excuse my handwriting." But Burns confesses in an interview: "That's not my handwriting." 
In its new ad campaign, created by <ORGANIZATION>D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, the ski industry is trying to change its image as a sport primarily for young white people.
"We used to show some hot-dog skier in his twenties or thirties going over the edge of a cliff," says <PERSON>Kathe Dillmann</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION>United Ski Industries Association</ORGANIZATION>, the trade group sponsoring the campaign. 
But in these crunch times for the ski industry, some resorts, such as the Angel Fire, <LOCATION>Red River</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Taos</ORGANIZATION> ski areas in <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, have even started shuttle-busing skiers to each other's slopes and next year plan to sell tickets good for all local lifts. 
<LOCATION>Vail</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, now has a playland that looks like an old mining town; kids can ski through and pan for fool's gold.
A few years ago, parents usually had to hire a sitter or take turns skiing while one spouse stayed with the children. "Most parents who had to go through that never came back," says <PERSON>Michael Shannon</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Vail Associates Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which owns and operates the <ORGANIZATION>Vail</ORGANIZATION> and nearby <LOCATION>Beaver Creek</LOCATION> resorts. 
"People these days want something else to do besides ski and sit in the bar," says <PERSON>Don Borgeson</PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION>Angel Fire</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>N.M.</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>. 
"Even if they could bring in that many new skiers, I don't know if {the industry} could handle that kind of an increase," says <PERSON>I. William Berry</PERSON>, editor and publisher of the Ski Industry Letter in <LOCATION>Katonah</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION> "Most people will come on the weekend, the slopes will be overcrowded and then these {new skiers} won't come back." 
<ORGANIZATION>Textron</ORGANIZATION> said that nine-months' results don't include earnings of <ORGANIZATION>Avdel PLC</ORGANIZATION>, a British maker of industrial fasteners, but do include interest costs of $16.4 million on borrowings related to the proposed purchase of <LOCATION>Avdel</LOCATION>.
For the quarter, <PERSON>Textron</PERSON> said aerospace revenue, including <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> helicopter and jet-engine manufacture, declined 9.8% to $755.9 million from $838.3 million, an indication of slowing government defense work. 
Until now, <ORGANIZATION>BNL</ORGANIZATION>'s top managers and its directors have been appointed by a <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> decree.
<ORGANIZATION>BNL</ORGANIZATION>, which is controlled by the Italian Treasury, was rocked by the disclosure last month that its <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> branch extended more than $3 billion in unauthorized credits to <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>BNL</ORGANIZATION> has about 75,000 nonvoting shares that are listed on the <ORGANIZATION>Milan Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>.
The shares were suspended from trading following disclosure of the <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> scandal; <ORGANIZATION>Consob</ORGANIZATION>, the stock exchange regulatory body, reportedly will decide soon whether to end the trading suspension. 
<PERSON>William Bennett</PERSON>, the White House drug-policy director, accused local officials in the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> area of blocking construction of prison facilities to house convicted drug dealers. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bennett</PERSON> declared in April that he would make <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> a "test case" for how the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration would aid cities afflicted by heavy drug trafficking and violence.
<PERSON>Mr. Bennett</PERSON> declined to name the area officials who he believes have impeded plans for building more federal prisons to ease <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s problem.
But other <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration officials have criticized <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>William Schaefer</PERSON> for blocking the use of possible sites in that state.
Administration officials also have said that <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Marion Barry</PERSON> has delayed consideration of sites in the city. 
In a letter to <PERSON>Mr. Bennett</PERSON>'s office, released yesterday, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s city administrator, <PERSON>Carol Thompson</PERSON>, complained that the drug czar had exaggerated the amount of federal drug-related assistance provided to the capital.
Referring to <PERSON>Mr. Bennett</PERSON>'s claim that the federal government would provide $97 million in emergency federal support, <PERSON>Ms. Thompson</PERSON> wrote, "Our analysis was unable to even come close to documenting that figure." 
Of his successes in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Bennett</PERSON> stressed that existing federal prisons have taken custody of 375 local inmates.
The <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION> has lent the <LOCATION>Washington U.S.</LOCATION> attorney 10 prosecutors, and the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Bureau of Investigation</ORGANIZATION> has provided crime laboratory facilities and training, he added. 
The government will try to sell all the real estate managed by the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Asset Disposition Association</ORGANIZATION> in one fell swoop, said <PERSON>William Seidman</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>FADA</ORGANIZATION> real-estate package, with an asking price of $428 million, is comprised of 150 properties in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Seidman</PERSON> is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Resolution Trust Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, established to sell or merge the nation's hundreds of insolvent savings-and-loan associations.
The <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION>, created by this year's S&L bailout legislation, is trying to sell <ORGANIZATION>FADA</ORGANIZATION>'s network of offices separately.
The properties held by <ORGANIZATION>FADA</ORGANIZATION> won't be sold piecemeal, <PERSON>Mr. Seidman</PERSON> said in a speech before <ORGANIZATION>Southern Methodist University Business School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>. "You need to buy the entire lot," <PERSON>Mr. Seidman</PERSON> said, "so get out your checkbooks." 
Domestic lending for real estate and property development was the source of <ORGANIZATION>Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd.</ORGANIZATION> 's most recent spate of financial troubles, the institution's executive chairman, <PERSON>Mohamed Basir Ismail</PERSON>, said. 
Speaking to reporters this week after <ORGANIZATION>Bank Bumiputra</ORGANIZATION>'s shareholders approved a rescue plan, <PERSON>Tan Sri Basir</PERSON> said heavy lending to the property sector rocked the bank when property prices in <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> plummeted in 1984-85. 
The predicament, he added, was similar to the <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> 1982-83 property-price collapse, which exposed the involvement of <ORGANIZATION>Bank Bumiputra</ORGANIZATION>'s former subsidiary in the colony in the largest banking scandal in <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>'s history.
The subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION>Bumiputra Malaysia Finance Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, was left with M$2.26 billion in bad loans made to <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> property speculators. 
<PERSON>Tan Sri Basir</PERSON> said the capital restructuring plan has been approved by <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Capital Issues Committee</ORGANIZATION> and central bank.
<LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>High Court</ORGANIZATION> is expected to approve the plan. 
Once the plan is approved, <PERSON>Tan Sri Basir</PERSON> said, most of <ORGANIZATION>Bank Bumiputra</ORGANIZATION>'s nonperforming loans will have been fully provided for and the bank will be on track to report a pretax profit of between M$160 million and M$170 million for the fiscal year ending March 31.
<LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>'s Banking Secrecy Act prohibited the bank from identifying delinquent borrowers, said <PERSON>Tan Sri Basir</PERSON>.
But public documents indicate 10% or more of the bank's provisions were made for foregone interest on a M$200 million loan to <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>'s dominant political party, the <ORGANIZATION>United Malays National Organization</ORGANIZATION>, to build its convention and headquarters complex in <LOCATION>Kuala Lumpur</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Westmoreland</LOCATION>'s strategy is to retain and expand its core business of mining and selling low-sulphur coal in the <LOCATION>Appalachia</LOCATION> region.
The operating territory includes coal terminals on the <LOCATION>Ohio River</LOCATION> and in <LOCATION>Newport News</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va</LOCATION>.
Nevertheless, <PERSON>Mr. Hutchinson</PERSON> predicted that 1989 would be "solidly profitable" for <LOCATION>Westmoreland</LOCATION> and that 1990 would bring "more of the same." For all of 1988, the company reported an after-tax operating loss of $134,000 on revenue of $593.5 million.
In a move that complements the company's basic strategy, its <ORGANIZATION>Westmoreland Energy Inc.</ORGANIZATION> unit is developing four coal-fired cogeneration plants with a partner in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Hutchinson</PERSON> predicted that the unit's contribution to company results in the 1990s "will be exciting." He said <LOCATION>Westmoreland</LOCATION> is looking at investment stakes in other cogeneration plants east of the <LOCATION>Mississippi River</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>Westmoreland</LOCATION> expects energy demand to grow annually in the 2.5% range in the early 1990s. "We see coal's piece of the action growing," <PERSON>Mr. Hutchinson</PERSON> said. "Coal prices, while not skyrocketing, will grow modestly in real terms, we think." 
Short interest on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> declined for the second consecutive month, this time 4.2%, while the <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> reported its third consecutive record month of short interest. 
For the year-earlier month, the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> reported 461,539,056 shares, indicating a 13.5% year-to-year rise, while the <ORGANIZATION>Amex</ORGANIZATION> reported 36,015,194 shares, a 48% leap. 
<ORGANIZATION>Varity Corp.</ORGANIZATION> led the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> list of largest short volumes with 12,822,563 shares.
<ORGANIZATION>Varity</ORGANIZATION> has proposed to acquire <ORGANIZATION>K-H Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, consisting of the auto parts division and some debt of <ORGANIZATION>Fruehauf Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, for $577.3 million of cash and securities. 
<ORGANIZATION>Chemical Waste Management</ORGANIZATION> posted the biggest increase in short volume on the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> exchange, up 3,383,477 shares to 5,267,238.
<ORGANIZATION>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the entity formed from the recent acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Squibb Corp.</ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION>Bristol-Myers Co.</ORGANIZATION>, logged the largest volume decline, 7,592,988 shares, to 12,017,724. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Amex</ORGANIZATION> short interest volume leader again was <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, rising to 3,820,634 shares from 3,363,949.
The adjacent tables show the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Amex</ORGANIZATION> issues in which a short interest position of at least 100,000 shares existed as of mid-October or in which there was a short position change of at least 50,000 shares since mid-September. 
When the swaying of the building woke me up, I reasoned that a) I was in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>; b) the bed was moving; c) it must be a <ORGANIZATION>Magic Fingers</ORGANIZATION> bed that had short-circuited.
But the broadcasts continued through the blacked-out night, with pictures of the sandwiched highway ganglion in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> and firefighting in the <LOCATION>Marina</LOCATION> district.
<PERSON>Mr. Delchamps</PERSON>, 46 years old, succeeds <PERSON>A.F. Delchamps Jr.</PERSON>, who died in a plane crash on Sunday at the age of 58.
But the <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones Transportation</ORGANIZATION> Average fell for the seventh-consecutive session as more investors dumped <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> shares. 
Bond prices rallied early yesterday morning as traders scrambled to buy <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> issues on fears that the <ORGANIZATION>Northern California</ORGANIZATION> earthquake might lead to a stock-market debacle.
"I'm surprised we didn't see more volatility" in stocks, said <PERSON>Raymond F. DeVoe Jr.</PERSON>, market strategist at <ORGANIZATION>Legg Mason Wood Walker</ORGANIZATION>. "I think the problems in the junk-bond area are just beginning, and this will be very unsettling for companies that have issued junk bonds.
However, many institutional investors are reacting to the stock market's plunge as "a great buying opportunity," said <PERSON>Charles I. Clough</PERSON>, chief investment strategist at <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ORGANIZATION>. "Things are beginning to settle down.
The larger parallel after the earthquake centered south of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> is surely with the state of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economy.
The eerie complacency of the <PERSON>Reagan-Bush</PERSON> era has produced <LOCATION>Panglossian</LOCATION> paeans about the present perfection of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economic and social arrangements.
A licensed government intellectual, <PERSON>Francis Fukuyama</PERSON>, recently announced in The National Interest that history is, so to speak, at an end since the course of human progress has now culminated in the glorious full stop of <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> civilization.
Left-stream economists I associate with -- fellows in the Union of Radical Political Economists, most particularly <PERSON>Robert Pollin</PERSON> of the economics faculty at the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION> at Riverside -- were not hypnotized in the manner of their pliant colleagues.
<PERSON>Mr. Fukuyama</PERSON>, peering through binoculars at the end of history, said in his essay that "the class issue has actually been successfully resolved in the West . . . the egalitarianism of modern <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> represents the essential achievement of the classless society envisioned by <PERSON>Marx</PERSON>." 
These are long-term <PERSON>Richter</PERSON> readings on <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> capitalism.

<PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON>, 50 years old, was formerly responsible for advanced materials, which include plastic composites and alloys, in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> only.
In the year-ago quarter, <ORGANIZATION>Viacom</ORGANIZATION> also paid preferred stock dividends of $17 million; <ORGANIZATION>Viacom</ORGANIZATION> exchanged its preferred stock for debt in March. 
<ORGANIZATION>Viacom</ORGANIZATION> attributed the improvement to higher earnings from operations in its networks segment, which includes the <ORGANIZATION>MTV</ORGANIZATION> and Showtime networks. 
<PERSON>Sumner M. Redstone</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Viacom</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, said <ORGANIZATION>Viacom</ORGANIZATION> "emerged from our leveraged buy-out structure and gained substantial operating and financial flexibility through" the bank pact. 
<PERSON>Michael F. Klatman</PERSON>, director of corporate public relations at <ORGANIZATION>Data General Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, was named to the new position of vice president, corporate communications, of this maker of data storage equipment. 
<PERSON>Edward J. Tirello Jr.</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, speculated that the sudden dividend elimination presages an expensive agreement with thrift regulators over the company's insolvent <ORGANIZATION>MeraBank</ORGANIZATION> savings and loan unit. 
The latest financial results at the troubled utility and thrift holding company, based in <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, reflect continuing problems at <ORGANIZATION>MeraBank</ORGANIZATION> and losses in real-estate, venture-capital and uranium-mining operations. 
<ORGANIZATION>Trinova Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Maumee</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, said it is launching an extensive restructuring of its core business, and took a charge that resulted in a loss of $29.7 million, or 87 cents a share, for the third quarter. 
In a separate announcement, <PERSON>Trinova</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Aeroquip</ORGANIZATION> group has agreed to sell its spring-brake, piston-brake and related businesses to <ORGANIZATION>Midland Brake Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Branford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Trinova</ORGANIZATION> closed at $25, down $1, in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading. 
Four years ago, <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> was designated the most-livable <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> city by <PERSON>Rand McNally</PERSON>'s Places Rated Almanac, and the honor did wonders to improve <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>'s soot-stained image. 
"People asked, is it really true?" says <PERSON>Maury Kelley</PERSON>, vice president, marketing services, for <ORGANIZATION>Beecham Products USA</ORGANIZATION>, a maker of health and personal-care products that used the ranking in its recruiting brochure. 
<LOCATION>Yuba City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, meanwhile, ranked dead last among 329 metro areas.
"We're encouraging a graceful transition," says <PERSON>Mary Kay Poppenberg</PERSON>, the organization's president. "Our attitude is that (the ranking) is like <LOCATION>Miss America</LOCATION>.
Tell that to <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, which <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> replaced as the most-livable city in 1985.
Two guys from <LOCATION>Gary</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION>?" 
Co-authors <PERSON>David Savageau</PERSON> and <PERSON>Richard Boyer</PERSON>, live in <LOCATION>Gloucester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Asheville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, respectively. "Atlanta," <PERSON>Mr. Savageau</PERSON> sniffs, "has unrealistic pretensions to world-class status." 
The new edition lists the top 10 metropolitan areas as <LOCATION>Anaheim-Santa Ana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Nassau-Suffolk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>; and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Savageau</PERSON> says earthquake or not, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> makes the list. 
But attention also rivets on who finishes last, and <LOCATION>Pine Bluff</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION> -- which finished third to last in 1981 and second to last in 1985 -- is certainly in the running. 
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> -- $200 million of general obligation tax revenue anticipation notes, Series 1990, due Sept. 28, 1990.

In addition, <ORGANIZATION>Tandy</ORGANIZATION> will acquire rights to the Victor and <ORGANIZATION>Micronic</ORGANIZATION> names for computers.
<LOCATION>Commodore</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Chester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, had said in August that it was consolidating manufacturing to cut costs and expected to be profitable in the fiscal first quarter. 
In fact, <ORGANIZATION>Commodore</ORGANIZATION>'s fiscal fourth-quarter loss was $2 million narrower than <ORGANIZATION>Commodore</ORGANIZATION> had expected a few weeks after the quarter closed.
Reflecting concerns about <ORGANIZATION>Commodore</ORGANIZATION>'s outlook, its stock has plunged more than 50% since May, closing yesterday unchanged at $8.875 a share in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Commodore</ORGANIZATION> has seemed to be setting the stage recently for progress in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, where its personal-computer sales have been so dismal for years that <ORGANIZATION>Commodore</ORGANIZATION> is close to dropping off research firms' market-share charts. 
<ORGANIZATION>Commodore</ORGANIZATION> had been counting on its consumer business to stay sufficiently healthy to support its efforts in other areas -- mainly in getting schools and businesses to use its <LOCATION>Amiga</LOCATION>, which has slick graphics yet has been slow to catch on because it isn't compatible with <ORGANIZATION>Apple Computer Inc.</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION> hardware.
But sales to consumers have become difficult during the past several months, even in <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, which has been by far <ORGANIZATION>Commodore</ORGANIZATION>'s strongest market. 
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Armonk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, has dominated the market for decades. 
That doesn't scare <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION>, which has grown to be the world's second-largest computer maker by poaching customers of <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>'s mid-range machines.
<ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Maynard</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, hopes to stage a repeat performance in mainframes, and it has spent almost $1 billion developing the new technology.
A spoiler, nimble <ORGANIZATION>Tandem Computers Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cupertino</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, jumped into the fray earlier this week with an aggressively priced entry. 
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> appears more worried about <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION>, which has a broad base of customers waiting for the new line, dubbed the VAX 9000. "It's going to be nuclear war," says <PERSON>Thomas Willmott</PERSON>, a consultant with <ORGANIZATION>Aberdeen Group Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>'s traditional mainframe rivals, including <ORGANIZATION>Unisys Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Control Data Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NCR Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, have struggled recently. 
<PERSON>Robert M. Glorioso</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for high performance systems, says <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION>'s mainframe is designed not as a central computer around which everything revolves, but as part of a decentralized network weaving together hundreds of workstations, personal computers, printers and other devices.
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> is five times the size of <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION> -- and 40 times the size of <ORGANIZATION>Tandem</ORGANIZATION> -- and wields enormous market power.
"We're not going to walk in and replace a company's corporate accounting system if it's already running on an <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> mainframe," concedes <PERSON>Kenneth H. Olsen</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION>'s president. 
A key marketing target for <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION> will be the large number of big customers who already own both <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> systems.
One such company is <ORGANIZATION>Bankers Trust Co</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Stanley Rose</PERSON>, a vice president, technological and strategic planning at <ORGANIZATION>Bankers Trust</ORGANIZATION>, says that despite <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION>'s low prices, "we aren't about to unplug our <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> mainframes for a <ORGANIZATION>DEC</ORGANIZATION> machine.
Bankers Trust uses <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>VAX</ORGANIZATION> to run its huge money-transfer and capital markets accounts, juggling hundreds of billions of dollars each day, he says.
As that system grows, larger computers may be needed. "In the past, customers had to go to <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> when they outgrew the <ORGANIZATION>VAX</ORGANIZATION>. Now they don't have to," he says. "That's going to cost <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> revenue." 
Analysts say <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION> can expect this pent-up demand for the new <ORGANIZATION>VAX</ORGANIZATION> to fuel strong sales next year.
<PERSON>Barry F. Willman</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, estimates the 9000 could boost sales by more than $1 billion in the fiscal year beginning in July.
The first model available will be the 210, which is likely to appeal to many technical and scientific buyers interested in the optional super-charger, or vector processor, says <PERSON>Terry Shannon</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>International Data Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a market research concern. 
<ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION>'s failure to deliver a true mainframe-class machine before now may have cost the company as much as $1 billion in revenue in fiscal 1989, <PERSON>Mr. Willman</PERSON> says. 
<ORGANIZATION>Amdahl Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, backed by <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Fujitsu Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, has a growing share of the market with its low-priced, IBM-compatible machines.
And <ORGANIZATION>National Advanced Systems</ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Hitachi Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Electronic Data Systems</ORGANIZATION>, is expected to unveil a line of powerful IBM-compatible mainframes later this year.

With airline deals in a tailspin, legendary Wall Street trader <PERSON>Michael Steinhardt</PERSON> could have trouble parachuting out of <ORGANIZATION>USAir Group</ORGANIZATION>, traders say. 
Only a week ago, when airline buy-out fever was already winding down, <PERSON>Mr. Steinhardt</PERSON> was engaged in a duel with <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION>.
In fighting <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Steinhardt</PERSON> was pitted against another investor, billionnaire <PERSON>Warren Buffett</PERSON>, who bought into <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> to help fend off <PERSON>Mr. Steinhardt</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr. Buffett</PERSON>'s firm, <ORGANIZATION>Berkshire Hathaway</ORGANIZATION>, holds a much bigger stake in the carrier than <PERSON>Mr. Steinhardt</PERSON>'s firm, <ORGANIZATION>Steinhardt Partners</ORGANIZATION>. 
Instead of hoping to sell his <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> stake at analysts' estimated buy-out price of $80 a share, <PERSON>Mr. Steinhardt</PERSON> is stuck with roughly 3.7 million <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> shares that cost him $45, on average, but yesterday closed at 40 1/2, up 1/4, in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading. 
"It doesn't make sense to parachute out at this price," <PERSON>Mr. Steinhardt</PERSON> says, though he has stopped his takeover talk and now commends <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> managers' "operating skills." 
At the current price, the <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> holding represents 9% of all the assets that <PERSON>Mr. Steinhardt</PERSON> manages.
A week ago, <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> stock briefly soared above 52 after a report in <LOCATION>USA</LOCATION> Today that <PERSON>Mr. Steinhardt</PERSON> might launch a hostile bid for the carrier, though takeover speculators say they were skeptical. 
"If <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> is worth 80 as a takeover and the stock went to 52, the market was saying <PERSON>Steinhardt</PERSON>'s presence wasn't worth anything, in terms of getting a deal done," says a veteran takeover speculator. 
In trying to raid <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Steinhardt</PERSON> abandoned his usual role as a passive investor, and ran into snags.
Moreover, unlike <PERSON>Mr. Buffett</PERSON>, who often holds big stakes in companies for years, <PERSON>Mr. Steinhardt</PERSON> hasn't in the past done much long-term investing. 
<PERSON>Mr. Steinhardt</PERSON>, who runs about $1.7 billion for <ORGANIZATION>Steinhardt Partners</ORGANIZATION>, made his name as a gunslinging trader, moving in and out of stocks with agility -- enriching himself and his investment clients.
Analysts say <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> stock might lose four or five points if the <PERSON>Steinhardt</PERSON> stake was dumped all at once.
As a result, <PERSON>Mr. Steinhardt</PERSON> must reconcile himself to selling <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> at a loss, or to holding the shares as an old-fashioned investment. 
"Long-term investing -- that's not <PERSON>Steinhardt</PERSON>'s style," chuckles an investor who once worked at <ORGANIZATION>Steinhardt Partners</ORGANIZATION>. "He doesn't usually risk that much unless he thinks he has an ace in the hole," adds another <ORGANIZATION>Steinhardt Partners</ORGANIZATION> alumnus. 
In recent days, traders say <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> has been buying its own shares, as part of a program to retire about eight million <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> shares, though the carrier won't discuss its buy-back program. 
If <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> stepped up its share purchases, that might be a way for <PERSON>Mr. Steinhardt</PERSON> to get out, says <PERSON>Timothy Pettee</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION> analyst.
But <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> might not want to help <PERSON>Mr. Steinhardt</PERSON>, he adds. 
In 1987, <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Edwin Colodny</PERSON> stonewalled when <ORGANIZATION>Trans World Airlines</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Carl Icahn</PERSON> threatened to take over the carrier.
<PERSON>Mr. Icahn</PERSON>, a much more practiced raider than <PERSON>Mr. Steinhardt</PERSON>, eventually sold a big <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> stake at a tiny profit through Bear, <PERSON>Stearns</PERSON>.
Especially galling for <PERSON>Mr. Steinhardt</PERSON>, say people close to him, is that <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Colodny</PERSON> won't even take his telephone calls.
While <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> isn't considered absolutely takeover-proof, its defenses, including the sale in August of a 12% stake in the company to <PERSON>Mr. Buffett</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Berkshire Hathaway</ORGANIZATION>, are pretty strong. 
<ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION>'s deal with <PERSON>Mr. Buffett</PERSON> "wasn't exactly a shining example of shareholder democracy," <PERSON>Mr. Steinhardt</PERSON> says.
<ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Mr. Buffett</PERSON> won't talk about <PERSON>Mr. Steinhardt</PERSON> at all. 
By the second half of 1990, <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> stock could hit 60, says <PERSON>Helane Becker</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton</ORGANIZATION>.
But meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> is expected to show losses or lackluster profit for several quarters as it tries to digest <ORGANIZATION>Piedmont Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, which it acquired.
However, <PERSON>Mr. Steinhardt</PERSON> says he's "comfortable holding <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> as an investment." While he has bought and sold some <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> shares in recent days, he says that contrary to rumors, he hasn't tried to unload his holding.
<PERSON>Mr. Steinhardt</PERSON> adds that he bought <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> stock earlier this year as "part of a fundamental investment in the airline group." 
In 1989, <PERSON>Mr. Steinhardt</PERSON> says he made money trading in <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>. Overall, his investments so far this year are showing gains of about 20%, he adds. 
As a result, last March the <ORGANIZATION>General Services Administration</ORGANIZATION> board of contract appeals directed <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> to reopen negotiations on the contract. 
The space shuttle Atlantis boosted the <LOCATION>Galileo</LOCATION> spacecraft on its way to <LOCATION>Jupiter</LOCATION>, giving a big lift as well to an ambitious <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> program of space exploration. 
Seven years late in the launching, $1 billion over budget and a target of anti-nuclear protestors, <PERSON>Galileo</PERSON> has long been a symbol of trouble for the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>.
But yesterday, as <LOCATION>Atlantis</LOCATION> rumbled into a patch of clear sky above <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> with storm clouds closing in on it, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> sought to turn Galileo into a symbol of triumph. 
"<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> did it right; that's the message," said <PERSON>J.R. Thompson</PERSON>, the agency's deputy administrator. 
Investigating <PERSON>Jupiter</PERSON> in detail may provide clues to what astronomer <PERSON>Tobias Owen</PERSON> calls the "cosmic paradox" of life: <PERSON>Jupiter</PERSON> and other bodies in the outer solar system are rich in elements such as hydrogen that are essential for life on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, but these planets are lifeless; <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, on the other hand, has a diminished store of such material but is rich in life.
Beginning in December 1995, <PERSON>Galileo</PERSON> will begin a two-year tour of the <LOCATION>Jovian</LOCATION> moons.
In 1979, two Voyager spacecraft sent back stunning photos of <LOCATION>Jovian</LOCATION> moons Io and <LOCATION>Europa</LOCATION> that showed them to be among the most intriguing bodies in the solar system.
Galileo's photos of <LOCATION>Europa</LOCATION> will be more than 1,000 times as sharp as <PERSON>Voyager</PERSON>'s, according to <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Galileo</PERSON>'s project scientist, and may show whether it actually has the only known ocean other than those on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
The five-member <ORGANIZATION>Atlantis</ORGANIZATION> crew will conduct several experiments, including growing plants and processing polymeric materials in space, before their scheduled landing at <ORGANIZATION>Edwards Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, Monday. 
An ebullient <PERSON>Mr. Johnson</PERSON>, wearing a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> baseball cap and carrying a camera and binoculars, called the launch "fantastic." <PERSON>Benny Chin</PERSON>, manager of the Galileo probe, compared it to watching a child leave home. "I'm happy and sad," he said. 
<PERSON>Galileo</PERSON> will skim past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in 1990 and 1992, collecting energy from the planet's gravitational field to gain momentum for its trip to <LOCATION>Jupiter</LOCATION>.
The protesters point out that <PERSON>Galileo</PERSON> also could crash to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> then. 
One protest did get past <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s guard, though; a computer virus caused anti-Galileo messages to flash onto some computer screens at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> centers. 
An unmanned spacecraft, <PERSON>Magellan</PERSON>, already is heading to <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> and is due to begin mapping the planet next August.
<ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> 2 sent back spectacular photos of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and its moon, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, this summer. 
Around Thanksgiving, the <ORGANIZATION>Solar Max</ORGANIZATION> satellite, which <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> repaired in orbit in 1984, will tumble back into the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere.

<ORGANIZATION>International Proteins</ORGANIZATION> shares didn't trade yesterday on the <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>.
Money-fund assets soared $4.5 billion in the week ended Tuesday, to a record $348.4 billion, according to <ORGANIZATION>IBC/Donoghue</ORGANIZATION>'s Money Fund Report, a <LOCATION>Holliston</LOCATION>, Mass.-based newsletter. 
Some fund managers say inflows could increase in coming days as a result of stock selling in the wake of Friday's 190.58point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. "If you're selling equities, you don't start getting proceeds for five to seven days," said <PERSON>Frank Rachwalski</PERSON>, who manages the <ORGANIZATION>Kemper Money Market Fund</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Neal Litvack</PERSON>, marketing vice president for <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Investments</ORGANIZATION>, said inflows Friday into <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Spartan</LOCATION> and Cash Reserves money-market funds were about twice normal levels, with about half coming from equity and junk-bond funds.
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> should stop throwing tax dollars out to sea by subsidizing the development of beach communities on ecologically fragile coastal barrier islands, such as the hard-hit Isle of Palms near <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>National Taxpayers Union</ORGANIZATION> would like <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to add 800,000 acres to the 453,000 of shoreline in the system by enacting "The Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1989." 
Also for sale are <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Wile Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which distributes <PERSON>Cutty Sark</PERSON> blended whiskey in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Whitbread</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Atlas Peak Vineyards</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Napa Valley</LOCATION>. 
For rival liquor companies, the <LOCATION>Whitbread</LOCATION> auction is a rare opportunity to acquire valuable brands. "It's not very often something like this comes up," said <PERSON>Ron Littleboy</PERSON>, a liquor company analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Nomura Research Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. 
"The division will be sold off quite rapidly," predicted <PERSON>Neill Junor</PERSON>, an analyst at <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> brokers <ORGANIZATION>County NatWest WoodMac</ORGANIZATION>.
Grand Met owns Bombay gin, the No. 3 imported gin in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>; rival <ORGANIZATION>Guinness PLC</ORGANIZATION> has the No. 1 imported brand, <LOCATION>Tanqueray</LOCATION>.
Two other global liquor giants, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Seagram Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Allied-Lyons PLC</ORGANIZATION>, also are possible buyers.
<ORGANIZATION>Seagram</ORGANIZATION>'s gin is the world's No. 2 gin brand, but the company doesn't own any of the major gin brands imported in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Allied-Lyons, while powerful in whiskey, doesn't own any major white-spirit brands. "We will certainly have to take a look at" the Whitbread spirits business, an <ORGANIZATION>Allied-Lyons</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. "We would certainly like to have a major white-spirits brand in our portfolio." A <ORGANIZATION>Seagram</ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> wouldn't comment. 
Smaller liquor companies, such as <ORGANIZATION>Brown-Forman Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>American Brands Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, also are likely to be interested.
Such companies "are increasingly being left behind" in the global liquor business, says <ORGANIZATION>Nomura</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Littleboy</PERSON>.
In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>American Brands</ORGANIZATION> wouldn't comment.
<PERSON>Brown-Forman</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION> distiller, also declined to comment. 
The company, which last month paid #50.7 million for regional <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> brewer <ORGANIZATION>Boddington Group PLC</ORGANIZATION>, has about 13% of the British beer market.
Whitbread also owns the license to brew and distribute <PERSON>Heineken</PERSON> and <PERSON>Stella Artois</PERSON> beers in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. 
In addition, <ORGANIZATION>Whitbread</ORGANIZATION> intends to focus on its newer hotel, liquor store and restaurant businesses in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>.
In <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, those interests include the Beefeater steakhouse chain and joint ownership with <ORGANIZATION>PepsiCo Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of the country's <ORGANIZATION>Pizza Hut</ORGANIZATION> chain.
In <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Whitbread</ORGANIZATION> owns The Keg chain of steak and seafood restaurants. 
Focusing on beer, restaurants and hotels means "we can concentrate our skills and resources more effectively," <PERSON>Peter Jarvis</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Whitbread</LOCATION>'s managing director, said in a statement.
FOREIGN PRIME RATES: <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> 13.50%; <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> 8.50%; <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> 4.875%; <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> 8.50%; <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> 15%.
<ORGANIZATION>FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORP.</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Freddie Mac</ORGANIZATION>): Posted yields on 30-year mortgage commitments for delivery within 30 days. 9.88%, standard conventional fixed-rate mortgages; 7.875%, 2% rate capped one-year adjustable rate mortgages.
<ORGANIZATION>FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Fannie Mae</ORGANIZATION>): Posted yields on 30 year mortgage commitments for delivery within 30 days (priced at par) 9.83%, standard conventional fixed-rate mortgages; 8.70%, 6/2 rate capped one-year adjustable rate mortgages.
Under the proposal by <ORGANIZATION>Equitec</ORGANIZATION>, a financially troubled real-estate syndicator, New York-based <ORGANIZATION>Hallwood Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> would replace <ORGANIZATION>Equitec</ORGANIZATION> as the newly formed master limited partnership's general partner and manager.
In a statement, <ORGANIZATION>Equitec</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Richard L. Saalfeld</PERSON> said the transfer will benefit both the company and investors in the 12 limited partnerships included in the proposed rollup.
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>Equitec</ORGANIZATION> closed at $2.625 a share, unchanged. 
Rep. <PERSON>Mary Rose Oakar</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>) at last week's hearings on irregularities in programs at the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Housing and Urban Development</ORGANIZATION>: 
And if I think that some people {on <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Jack Kemp</PERSON>'s} staff are off base in terms in which they're evaluating certain things affecting my hometown, I have to tell you something -- I'm not going to take it.
<ORGANIZATION>FREDERICK'S OF HOLLYWOOD Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, said its board voted a 50% increase in the specialty boutique-store operator's semiannual dividend, to five cents a common share.
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar PLC</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman said he hopes to reach a friendly pact with <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> within a month that may involve the British luxury-car maker's producing a cheaper executive model. 
Sir <PERSON>John Egan</PERSON> told reporters at <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Motorfair</PERSON> yesterday he "would be disappointed if we couldn't do {the deal} within a month." He said the tie-up would mean <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> could "develop cars down range {in price} from where we are" by offering access to <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s high-volume parts production.
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> figures a friendly alliance with <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> will fend off unwelcome advances from <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co</ORGANIZATION>.
But <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s biggest shareholder since lifting its stake to 10.4% this week, is pressing harder for talks with Sir <PERSON>John</PERSON>. "We're getting to the point where we are going to have to meet" with him, one <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> official said yesterday.
Sir <PERSON>John</PERSON> has spurned <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s advances since the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auto giant launched a surprise bid for as much as 15% of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> last month.
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> has signaled it might acquire a majority interest later. "I'm not obligated to sit down and talk to anybody," the <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> chairman asserted yesterday.
The fiercely proud but financially strapped <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> company prefers to remain independent and publicly held, despite <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s promise of access to cash and technological know-how. 
Sir <PERSON>John</PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>, a longtime <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> supplier, agrees "we should remain an independent company." He said <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> started negotiating with <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> and several other car makers over a year ago, but the rest "dropped by the wayside ever since the share price went above #4 ($6.30) a share." <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shares stood at 405 pence before <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s initial announcement, but the subsequent takeover frenzy has driven them up.
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s help would "make it possible {for <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>} to build a wider range of cars." An executive model would significantly boost <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s yearly output of 50,000 cars. "You are talking about a couple hundred thousand a year," said <PERSON>Bob Barber</PERSON>, an auto-industry analyst at <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> brokerage <ORGANIZATION>James Capel & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
The deal would require approval by a majority of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shareholders. "We have to make it attractive enough that {holders} would accept it," Sir <PERSON>John</PERSON> said. 
That may be difficult, the <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> chairman acknowledged, "when you have somebody else breathing down your neck." <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> probably would try to kill the proposal by enlisting support from <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> takeover-stock speculators and holding out the carrot of a larger bid later, said <PERSON>Stephen Reitman</PERSON>, European auto analyst at <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> brokers <ORGANIZATION>UBS Phillips & Drew</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> can't make a full-fledged bid for <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> until <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> government restrictions expire.
But with its 10.4% stake, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> can convene a special <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shareholders' meeting and urge them to drop the restrictions prematurely. "It's a very valuable weapon in their armory," which could enable <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> to bid sooner for <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, observed <PERSON>Mr. Barber</PERSON> of <PERSON>James Capel</PERSON>. 
Otherwise, <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> may have to tolerate the two <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auto giants each owning a 15% stake for more than a year. "It would be difficult to see how a car company can be owned by a collective," Sir <PERSON>John</PERSON> said. "It has never been done before, but there's always a first." 
Many in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> say President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> will have to raise taxes to pay for his war on drugs.
This month, <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Jack Kemp</PERSON> unveiled a series of proposed reforms to improve management at <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION>. No doubt many of his ideas are worthy, but ultimately he is proposing to make fundamentally flawed programs work slightly more fairly and efficiently.
Last week, Secretary <PERSON>Kemp</PERSON> ran into a buzzsaw of criticism from <ORGANIZATION>House Banking Committee</ORGANIZATION> members.
They were appalled, for instance, that he wanted to target more of the $3 billion <ORGANIZATION>Community Development Block Grant</ORGANIZATION> (CDBG) program to low-income projects and zero out the notorious "discretionary" funds that have allowed <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> officials to steer contracts to political cronies. 
They also give those in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> political credit for bringing home the pork, and so they are popular with such Members as <PERSON>Mary Rose Oakar</PERSON>. 
Rep. <PERSON>Oakar</PERSON>, a Democrat from <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, wants a $6.9 million grant so <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland</ORGANIZATION> can build an 18-story Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
<ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> says the project doesn't qualify, and <PERSON>Mr. Kemp</PERSON> says that rock 'n' roll musicians and the music industry ought to put up the money. 
At the hearing, Rep. <PERSON>Oakar</PERSON> started wailing about "phoney baloney regulations" that would stand between her and "housing for downtown Cleveland." Rep. <PERSON>Chalmers Wylie</PERSON>, an <LOCATION>Ohio Republican</LOCATION>, rallied to the cause: "I think the gentlelady is making an important statement.
We're sure some theologian can explain the difference between what the Republican consultants have been doing with <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> and what these gentleladies and gentlemen want to do with <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION>.
Our view is that given <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>'s attitude toward <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION>, the place probably is beyond reform. 
Even suburban Prince <PERSON>George</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, reported last week there have been a record 96 killings there this year, most of them drug-related.
It's still unclear whether Secretary <PERSON>Kemp</PERSON> wants to completely overhaul the engine room at <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> or just tighten a few screws here and there.
Having seen the hypocrisy with which <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> has addressed the <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> scandals, we disagree.
They tried to put <PERSON>Mr. Maynard</PERSON> out of business by an act of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
But when <PERSON>Mr. Maynard</PERSON> came forward with his machine in the early 1970s nobody else was offering them in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
Opponents don't buy such arguments. "Human nature being what it is, people don't always follow instructions," says <PERSON>Jack Guzewich</PERSON>, chief of food protection for the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION>Health Department</ORGANIZATION>. 
The Decatur, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, trade group has issued a "briefing book" that claims the machine is "a health hazard" and that <PERSON>Mr. Maynard</PERSON> is trying "to make a fast buck at the expense of the nation's egg producers." The <ORGANIZATION>UEP</ORGANIZATION> declines to comment, but the group's attorney, <PERSON>Alfred Frawley</PERSON>, says the group's actions are motivated solely by "health concerns." 
<PERSON>Mr. Maynard</PERSON> initially won approval for his machine to be used at egg-processing facilities regulated by the <ORGANIZATION>USDA's Food Safety Inspection Service</ORGANIZATION>.
Unfortunately for <PERSON>Mr. Maynard</PERSON>, another branch of the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Agricultural Marketing Service</ORGANIZATION>, was in charge of eggs.
But the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> in a 1985 letter to the <ORGANIZATION>United Egg Producers</ORGANIZATION> said that there was "little likelihood" of a health problem as long as instructions were followed. 
So the producers went to <LOCATION>Capitol Hill</LOCATION>, where a congressman from <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> introduced a measure to ban centrifugal egg-breaking machines.
<PERSON>Mr. Maynard</PERSON>, whose company at the time was based in <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, enlisted his local congressman, and the battle was joined. 
<PERSON>Mr. Maynard</PERSON>'s forces finally defeated the measure, though it took a vote on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> to do it.
So far, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> have outlawed <PERSON>Mr. Maynard</PERSON>'s device, citing health concerns. 
An antitrust suit that <PERSON>Mr. Maynard</PERSON>'s company filed in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> federal court against the <ORGANIZATION>United Egg Producers</ORGANIZATION> and others only added to the entrepreneur's woes.
Now he has moved to <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> where costs are lower, and started a new company, <ORGANIZATION>Adsi Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, to market his machine.
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> sent President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> an $18.4 billion fiscal 1990 <ORGANIZATION>Treasury and Postal Service</ORGANIZATION> bill providing $5.5 billion for the <ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION> and increasing the <ORGANIZATION>Customs Service</ORGANIZATION>'s air-interdiction program nearly a third. 
And <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION> lawmakers were a driving force behind $54.6 million for <LOCATION>U.S.-Mexico</LOCATION> border facilities, or more than double the administration's request. 
Despite administration reservations, the plan has had the quiet backing of customs officials as well as influential lawmakers from <ORGANIZATION>Cessna</ORGANIZATION>'s home state, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>. 
Less noticed is a bit of legislative legerdemain by <ORGANIZATION>Houston Republicans</ORGANIZATION> on behalf of <ORGANIZATION>HEI Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> to retroactively "move" a <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> hospital from one county to the next to justify higher <ORGANIZATION>Medicare</ORGANIZATION> reimbursements.
The provision seeks to wipe out an estimated $1.4 million in claims made by the <ORGANIZATION>Health Care Finance Administration</ORGANIZATION> against <ORGANIZATION>HEI</ORGANIZATION>, which owned the hospital in <LOCATION>Sullivan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>, during most of the four-year period -- 1983-1987 -- covered in the amendment. 
In a separate development, a private meeting is scheduled this morning between <ORGANIZATION>House Appropriations Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Jamie Whitten</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Miss.</LOCATION>) and <PERSON>Sen. Dale Bumpers</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>) in an effort to end a dispute which for two weeks has delayed action on an estimated $44 billion agriculture bill.
The program's nonprofit sponsors received $900,000 in fiscal 1989 through an <ORGANIZATION>Extension Service</ORGANIZATION> grant, but <PERSON>Mr. Whitten</PERSON> has been adamant in insisting that the program be cut in 1990.
The 79-year-old Mississippian takes a more orthodox, entrenched view of agriculture policy than those in the movement to reduce chemical use, but as a master of pork-barrel politics, he is believed to be annoyed as well that the project moved to <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> from a <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> center near Memphis and the northern <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> border. 
Tenders for the notes, available in minimum $5,000 denominations, must be received by 1 p.m. EDT Tuesday at the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> or at <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> banks or branches. 
They reportedly will invest a total of 20 billion yen ($140 million) in the venture, whose headquarters would be in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>. 
The action follows <ORGANIZATION>Federal Express Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Flying Tiger Line Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in August.
After that, "it would make sense for airlines to talk about doing things jointly," said <PERSON>Cotton Daly</PERSON>, director of cargo services for <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> consulting firm <ORGANIZATION>Simat, Helliesen & Eichner Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Daly</PERSON> said such discussions are motivated by the competitive threat posed by <ORGANIZATION>Federal Express</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>United Parcel Service of America Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and other fast-growing air-freight companies.
In <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>JAL</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said he couldn't confirm or deny the latest Japanese report.
But he said <ORGANIZATION>JAL</ORGANIZATION> is talking to <ORGANIZATION>Lufthansa</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Air France</ORGANIZATION> about some sort of cargo venture. "It is just one of a number of strategies <ORGANIZATION>JAL</ORGANIZATION> has embarked upon to come to terms with the situation in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> after 1992," the deadline for ending trade barriers in the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>, he said. 
In <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Lufthansa</ORGANIZATION> spokesman confirmed talks are under way, but declined to comment.
A <ORGANIZATION>Lufthansa</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> said the head of <ORGANIZATION>Lufthansa</ORGANIZATION>'s cargo operations had been in <LOCATION>Toyko</LOCATION> last week for talks with <ORGANIZATION>JAL</ORGANIZATION>.
In <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Air France</ORGANIZATION> declined to comment. 
<ORGANIZATION>Air France</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Lufthansa</ORGANIZATION> last month concluded a far-reaching cooperation accord that includes air-freight activities.
Several airlines, including <ORGANIZATION>Lufthansa</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>JAL</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Cathay Pacific Airways</ORGANIZATION>, are working on a so-called global cargo system and are trying to attract other carriers to join, <PERSON>Mr. Daly</PERSON> said. 
<ORGANIZATION>JAL</ORGANIZATION> also has signaled it is looking for toeholds in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> before the end of 1992.
Last month, the carrier said it wanted to lease crews and planes from <ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION> so it could funnel its passengers from <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> to other European destinations. 
<ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION> said it hasn't received a proposal from <ORGANIZATION>JAL</ORGANIZATION>.
But last week there were air-traffic negotiations between the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, a likely first step to any commercial agreement between <ORGANIZATION>JAL</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION> or another <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> carrier. 
He will succeed <PERSON>Arthur E. Himebaugh</PERSON> as general manager Feb. 1, when <PERSON>Mr. Himebaugh</PERSON> retires. 
<ORGANIZATION>Valley National Corp.</ORGANIZATION> reported a third-quarter net loss of $72.2 million, or $3.65 a share, and suspended its quarterly dividend because of potential losses on its <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> real estate holdings. 
"The <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> real estate market continues to be depressed, and there is still uncertainty as to when values will recover," <PERSON>James P. Simmons</PERSON>, chairman, said.
<PERSON>Richard M. Greenwood</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Valley National</ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president, said then that the company believed the write-downs were "adequate" and didn't plan to increase its reserves again. 
<PERSON>Bruce Hoyt</PERSON>, a banking analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Boettcher & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> brokerage firm, said <ORGANIZATION>Valley National</ORGANIZATION> "isn't out of the woods yet." The key will be whether <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> real estate turns around or at least stabilizes, he said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Northrop Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's third-quarter net income fell 25% to $21.5 million, or 46 cents a share, while <ORGANIZATION>General Dynamics Corp.</ORGANIZATION> reported nearly flat earnings of $76.5 million, or $1.83 a share. 
<ORGANIZATION>Northrop</ORGANIZATION> said sales fell because of the decline in B-2 development dollars from the government as the plane continues its initial production stage and because fewer F/A-18 fighter sections are being produced in its subcontract work with prime contractor <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Northrop</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at $21.125, off 25 cents.
A group of investors, including <PERSON>Giancarlo Parretti</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Pathe Communications Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sasea Holding S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, have agreed to buy 76.66% of <ORGANIZATION>Odeon Finanziaria</ORGANIZATION>, a financially troubled <LOCATION>Italian</LOCATION> TV station. 
<PERSON>Florio Fiorini</PERSON>, managing director of Geneva-based <PERSON>Sasea</PERSON>, said the investors would pay only a symbolic one lira for the station, "but we have agreed to raise the capital that will enable the company to continue operating.
He added that details of the recapitalization still have to be worked out, but that <ORGANIZATION>Pathe</ORGANIZATION> will take 50% of <LOCATION>Odeon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> film producer <PERSON>Bruno Lucisano</PERSON> will take 10% and the remaining 16.66%, currently owned by <LOCATION>Sasea</LOCATION>, will eventually be sold to other investors.
<PERSON>Calisto Tanzi</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Odeon</ORGANIZATION>'s owner, will retain his 23.34% stake. 
<LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> this year ordered <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> to write a law that will regulate media ownership. "We think that it's going to be far more favorable to own a station before the law is passed than to try to buy one afterward," <PERSON>Mr. Fiorini</PERSON> said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Control Data</ORGANIZATION> has been seeking a buyer for the facility since it folded its <ORGANIZATION>ETA Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION> supercomputer unit this past April. 
<ORGANIZATION>Norton</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> last month filed a lawsuit against the former research manager, <PERSON>Chien-Min Sung</PERSON>, charging him with stealing trade secrets. 
<PERSON>Mr. Sung</PERSON> formerly worked at <ORGANIZATION>General Electric</ORGANIZATION> in research on synthetic diamonds.
He earlier denied the allegations against him in the lawsuit by <PERSON>Norton</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Diamond-Star Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture of <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it will begin shipping <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Eclipse</ORGANIZATION> cars to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> next week, emulating other Japanese auto ventures shipping U.S.-built vehicles back to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Diamond-Star</ORGANIZATION> said it will export about 1,500 Eclipse cars to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> by year's end. 
<ORGANIZATION>Honda Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the first Japanese auto maker to ship cars to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, is now exporting more than 5,000 Accord Coupes a year from its <LOCATION>Marysville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, factory. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>Dayton</ORGANIZATION> rose $1 to $61.125. 
whose <ORGANIZATION>Della Femina McNamee</ORGANIZATION> WCRS agency created liar <PERSON>Joe Isuzu</PERSON>, among others -- announced a massive restructuring that largely removes it from the advertising business and includes selling the majority of its advertising unit to Paris-based <ORGANIZATION>Eurocom</ORGANIZATION>. 
It also creates a newly merged world-wide ad agency controlled by <ORGANIZATION>Eurocom</ORGANIZATION> and headed jointly by <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> ad man <PERSON>Jerry Della Femina</PERSON> and two top <ORGANIZATION>WCRS</ORGANIZATION> executives.
<ORGANIZATION>WCRS</ORGANIZATION>'s restructuring reflects the growing importance of media buying in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, where the only way to get a good price on advertising time and space is to buy it in bulk.
For <ORGANIZATION>Eurocom</ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, the move gives it a strong <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> foothold in <LOCATION>Della Femina</LOCATION>, and more than quadruples the size of its ad agency business world-wide.
According to terms, <ORGANIZATION>WCRS</ORGANIZATION> will pay 2.02 billion French francs ($318.6 million) for the 50% it doesn't already own of <ORGANIZATION>Carat Holding S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s largest media buyers.
Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Eurocom</ORGANIZATION>, which had held 20% of <ORGANIZATION>WCRS</ORGANIZATION>'s ad unit, will pay #43.5 million ($68.5 million) to raise its stake to 60%.
That price also covers <ORGANIZATION>Eurocom</ORGANIZATION> raising to 60% its 51% stake in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Belier Group</ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture ad agency network it owns with <ORGANIZATION>WCRS</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Eurocom</ORGANIZATION> will also have the right to buy the remaining 40% of the merged ad agency group in six years. 
The transaction places the three executives squarely at the helm of a major agency with the rather unwieldy name of <ORGANIZATION>Eurocom WCRS Della Femina Ball Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION>EWDB</ORGANIZATION>.
The merged agency will include <ORGANIZATION>Della Femina McNamee</ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Eurocom</LOCATION>'s various agencies in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Belier Group</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>WCRS</ORGANIZATION>'s other advertising and direct marketing operations. 
<PERSON>Mr. Della Femina</PERSON> will be joint chairman with former <ORGANIZATION>WCRS</ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON>Robin Wight</PERSON>.
Both will report to <PERSON>Tim Breene</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>WCRS</ORGANIZATION> executive who will be chief executive officer at the new agency. 
In an interview in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Breene</PERSON>, fresh from a <LOCATION>Concorde</LOCATION> flight from <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> where executives had worked through most of the night, outlined big plans for the new agency. "Our goal is to develop quite rapidly to a top-10 position . . . by the end of three years from now.
He added that <ORGANIZATION>Eurocom</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>WCRS</ORGANIZATION> had agreed to provide a development fund of #100 million for acquisitions.
The new agency group is already in discussions about a possible purchase in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, while <PERSON>Mr. Breene</PERSON> said it also plans to make acquisitions in <LOCATION>Scandinavia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and elsewhere. 
<ORGANIZATION>Della Femina</ORGANIZATION> had billings of just $660 million last year and ranked as the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>'s 24th-largest ad agency.
To make it to top-10 status, it would have to leapfrog over such formidable forces as Grey Advertising, <ORGANIZATION>D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Omnicom</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>DDB Needham</ORGANIZATION>. 
When <ORGANIZATION>WCRS</ORGANIZATION> created <PERSON>Della Femina McNamee</PERSON> out of the merger of three smaller agency units in 1988, it said it did so in order to attract larger clients, especially packaged-goods companies.
Since then, <ORGANIZATION>Della Femina</ORGANIZATION> won <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> as an international client and also does work for a few packaged-goods clients, including <ORGANIZATION>Dow Chemical Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's Saran Wrap. 
But major packaged-goods players of the world -- such as <ORGANIZATION>Procter & Gamble</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Colgate-Palmolive</ORGANIZATION> and Unilever -- have steadfastly eluded the agency. "Three of our favorite names," <PERSON>Mr. Della Femina</PERSON> calls that roster, adding hopefully, "We're a much more attractive agency to large multinationals today than we were yesterday." 
As part of the restructuring, <ORGANIZATION>WCRS</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Eurocom</ORGANIZATION> said they will look for ways to combine their media buying across <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 
What's more, both <ORGANIZATION>Eurocom</ORGANIZATION> and brothers <PERSON>Francis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gilbert Gross</PERSON>, who founded Carat, will acquire 14.99% stakes in <ORGANIZATION>WCRS Group</ORGANIZATION>, creating a powerful link between <ORGANIZATION>Eurocom</ORGANIZATION> and Carat.
Carat will receive its <ORGANIZATION>WCRS</ORGANIZATION> stake as part of payment for the 50% Carat stake that <ORGANIZATION>WCRS</ORGANIZATION> is buying, while <ORGANIZATION>Eurocom</ORGANIZATION> said it expects to pay about #32 million for its WCRS stake. 
<PERSON>Mr. Della Femina</PERSON> says he plans to remain heavily involved in the creative product at the world-wide agency, serving as a sort of "creative conscience." <PERSON>Louise McNamee</PERSON>, <PERSON>Della Femina</PERSON>'s president, will continue running the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> agency day-to-day.
<ORGANIZATION>WCRS Group</ORGANIZATION>, for its part, will now be able to follow its longstanding plan of becoming "a holding company for a series of media-related businesses," said <PERSON>Peter Scott</PERSON>, the firm's chief executive.
For Carat, meanwhile, the alliance with <ORGANIZATION>Eurocom</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>WCRS</ORGANIZATION> is intended to strengthen its own push outside <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
But now, other agencies are getting into the business with their own competing media-buying groups -- and <ORGANIZATION>Carat</ORGANIZATION> wants to expand to the rest of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 
But <ORGANIZATION>WCRS</ORGANIZATION> added that "in the light of the current uncertainty in the equity markets," it has arranged medium-term debt financing, which would be underwritten by <ORGANIZATION>Samuel Montagu & Co</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 
While no agencies reported injuries to employees, the quake damaged the offices of <PERSON>J. Walter Thompson</PERSON>, Chiat/Day/Mojo and <ORGANIZATION>DDB Needham</ORGANIZATION>, among others, spokesmen for those agencies said.
Staffers at <LOCATION>Thompson</LOCATION>, whose offices are in the ultramodern <ORGANIZATION>Embarcadero Center</ORGANIZATION>, watched pictures drop from the walls and then felt the skyscraper sway seven to eight feet, according to a spokeswoman.
A number of agencies, including <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Foote</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Cone & Belding</ORGANIZATION>, said some employees who live outside of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, fearful that they wouldn't be able to get home, spent the night at the agency. 
NEW ACCOUNT: <ORGANIZATION>Chesebrough-Pond's Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Greenwich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, awarded its Faberge hair care accounts to <PERSON>J. Walter Thompson</PERSON>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Thompson</PERSON>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>WPP Group</ORGANIZATION>, will handle <ORGANIZATION>Faberge Organic</ORGANIZATION> shampoo and conditioner and <ORGANIZATION>Aqua</ORGANIZATION> Net hairspray.
The accounts, which billed about $7 million last year, according to <ORGANIZATION>Leading National Advertisers</ORGANIZATION>, were previously handled at <LOCATION>Bozell</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
WHO'S NEWS: <PERSON>William Morrissey</PERSON>, 44, was named executive vice president, world-wide director of <ORGANIZATION>McCann Direct</ORGANIZATION>, the direct marketing unit of <ORGANIZATION>Interpublic Group's McCann-Erickson</ORGANIZATION> agency.
<LOCATION>BOZELL</LOCATION>: <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> will be the site of a new entertainment division for the ad agency.
The division will be headed by <PERSON>Dick Porter</PERSON>, who returns to <PERSON>Bozell</PERSON> after being vice president of media at <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION>. 
AC&R ADVERTISING: The agency's three <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> offices, previously called AC&R/CCL Advertising, will now be called AC&R Advertising to match the name of its <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> office.
NEW BEER: <ORGANIZATION>Sibra Products Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Greenwich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, awarded its Cardinal Amber Light beer account to <ORGANIZATION>Heidelberg & Associates</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Heidelberg</PERSON>'s first ads for the brand, which <PERSON>Sibra</PERSON> says will compete with imported light beer leader <PERSON>Amstel Light</PERSON>, feature the line "The best tasting light beer you've ever seen." 
<ORGANIZATION>Petco Options</ORGANIZATION>, an options trading firm owned by the family of the deceased former <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Board of Trade</ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON>Ralph Peters</PERSON>, is getting out of the trade clearing, or processing and guaranteeing, business after sustaining a multimillion dollar loss Friday, options industry officials said. 
Nearly 75 options traders on the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Board Options Exchange</ORGANIZATION> who cleared trades through <ORGANIZATION>Petco</ORGANIZATION>, including a handful of traders who lost between $500,000 to $1 million themselves as a result of Friday's debacle, are trying to transfer their business to other clearing firms, <ORGANIZATION>CBOE</ORGANIZATION> members said. 
<PERSON>Timothy Vincent</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Petco</ORGANIZATION> chief executive officer, confirmed that <ORGANIZATION>Petco</ORGANIZATION> was withdrawing from the clearing business. "The owners of the company got a look at the potential risks in this business, and after Monday they felt they didn't want to be exposed any more," he said.
A <ORGANIZATION>CBOE</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman declined comment on <LOCATION>Petco</LOCATION>. 
Over the weekend <ORGANIZATION>Fossett Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, another options trading firm, transferred the clearing accounts of about 160 traders to <ORGANIZATION>First Options of Chicago</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Continental Bank Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, because it couldn't meet regulatory capital requirements after Friday's market slide.
The <ORGANIZATION>CBOE</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Options Clearing Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Stephen Fossett</PERSON>, owner of <PERSON>Fossett</PERSON>, joined in putting up $50 million to guarantee the accounts at First Options. 
<PERSON>Mr. Peters</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>LaSalle Street</ORGANIZATION> legend among the post-World War II generation of commodity traders, was rumored to have amassed a multimillion-dollar fortune from commodity trading and other activities by the time he died in May. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ameritech Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's earnings increased 2.8%, after strong revenue gains were offset somewhat by refunds and rate reductions imposed by regulators in its <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> territory. 
<ORGANIZATION>BellSouth Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's third-quarter earnings dropped 3.8% as a result of debt refinancing, the recent acquisition of a cellular and paging property and rate reductions in its <LOCATION>Southeast</LOCATION> territory. 
<ORGANIZATION>BellSouth</ORGANIZATION> Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON>John L. Clendenin</PERSON> said three factors accounted for the drop in third-quarter earnings.
The company previously said that the recent acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Mobile Communications Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> would dilute 1989 earnings by about 3%.
In addition, earnings were reduced by rate reductions in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ameritech At Ameritech</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, customer access lines increased by 402,000, or 2.6%, and cellular mobile lines increased by 80,000, or 62.3%, for the 12-month period ended Sept. 30. 
<PERSON>Tom Schumacher</PERSON>, executive vice president and general manager of the <ORGANIZATION>California Trucking Association</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Sacremento</LOCATION>, said his organization urged trucking firms to halt all deliveries into the <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area yesterday, except for emergency-medical supplies. "Some foodstuff shipments will probably resume Thursday," he said. "Right now most of the roads into the <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area are closed, but the list of closings changes about every 20 minutes.
This {Wednesday} morning the <LOCATION>San Mateo</LOCATION> bridge was open and now we are informed that it is closed," <PERSON>Mr. Schumacher</PERSON> said. 
<ORGANIZATION>United Parcel Service</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Greenwich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, said its operations in the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> area have been reduced to 40% of normal.
<ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's rail unit said that except for damage to shipping containers in its <ORGANIZATION>Oakland</ORGANIZATION> yard, its track, bridges and structures were unharmed.
<ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Transportation Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the hardest hit of the three railroads in the <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area, said service on its north-south coastline, which is used by an <ORGANIZATION>Amtrak</ORGANIZATION> train between <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>, was suspended temporarily because of kinked rails near the epicenter of the quake.
<ORGANIZATION>Amtrak</ORGANIZATION> said it suspended train service into its <ORGANIZATION>Oakland</ORGANIZATION> station, which sustained "heavy structural damage" during the quake.
The passenger railroad said it terminated some runs in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>, relying on buses to ferry passengers to the <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area.
<ORGANIZATION>Amtrak</ORGANIZATION> said it planned to resume some train operations to <ORGANIZATION>Oakland</ORGANIZATION> late yesterday. 
Rail-transit operations suffered little damage, according to <PERSON>Albert Engelken</PERSON>, deputy executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>American Public Transit Association</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Bay Area Rapid Transit</ORGANIZATION> "withstood the earthquake perfectly," said <PERSON>Mr. Engelken</PERSON>, adding that the rail system was running a full fleet of 45 trains during the day to provide an alternative for highway travelers. "The highway system is screwed up" by the earthquake, <PERSON>Mr. Engelken</PERSON> said. "The transit system is how people are going to be getting around." He added that <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s trolley cars and trolley buses were also running at full service levels. 
Runways at <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> weren't damaged, but traffic was being limited yesterday to 27 arrivals and 27 departures an hour -- down from 33 to 45 an hour normally -- mainly because the noise level in the control tower was overwhelming without the windows, an <ORGANIZATION>FAA</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said. 
While the airport was closed, flights were diverted to airports in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Stockton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Reno</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>; and <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, the largest carrier at <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, was operating only 50% of its scheduled service in and out of the area because of damage to its terminal, which in turn was causing delays for travelers headed to the <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area.
The airports in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Oakland</ORGANIZATION> were both fully operational by noon yesterday, the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Aviation Administration</ORGANIZATION> said. 
In terms of diversions, <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Stapleton International</ORGANIZATION> may have experienced the most far-flung: A <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> was rerouted there. "I think that's the first nonstop commercial passenger flight from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to land here," an airport spokesman said. 
A <ORGANIZATION>Japan Air Lines</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said its flights into and out of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> weren't affected, but getting information about its operations was difficult.
Its telecommunications headquarters in <LOCATION>Burlingame</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, had been knocked out since the quake. "We're in the dark," he said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Computer Associates</ORGANIZATION> has carved out a huge business selling such software for use in managing networks of <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION> computers but needs to find new markets if it is to maintain its growth rate of 30% and more each year.
The market for system-management software for <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION>'s hardware is fragmented enough that a giant such as <ORGANIZATION>Computer Associates</ORGANIZATION> should do well there. 
For one thing, <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Maynard</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, has sold fewer machines.
<PERSON>Betty Lombardi</PERSON> is a mild-mannered homemaker and grandmother in rural <LOCATION>Hunterdon County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>
After she heard about the artery-clogging hazards of tropical oils in many cookies, she dropped <ORGANIZATION>Pepperidge Farm</ORGANIZATION> and started buying brands free of such oils. "I always thought Pepperidge Farm was tasty and high quality," <PERSON>Mrs. Lombardi</PERSON> says. "But I don't want any of that oil for my grandkids." (<ORGANIZATION>Pepperidge Farm</ORGANIZATION> says it can't tell exactly how many customers it has lost, but it hopes to remove the objectionable tropical oil from all its products by year end.) 
"Marketers have brought this on themselves with their heavy use" of promotions, contends <PERSON>Joe Plummer</PERSON>, an executive vice president at the <ORGANIZATION>D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles</ORGANIZATION> ad agency. "Without some real product improvements, it's going to be difficult to win that loyalty back." 
For the survey, <ORGANIZATION>Peter D. Hart Research Associates</ORGANIZATION> asked some 2,000 consumers, including <PERSON>Mrs. Lombardi</PERSON>, whether they usually buy one brand of a certain type of product or have no brand loyalty.
<PERSON>Kathie Huff</PERSON>, a respondent in the Journal survey from <LOCATION>Spokane</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, says her husband is adamant about eating only <PERSON>Hunt</PERSON>'s ketchup.
<ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Pepsi</PERSON> are all the same to me, and I usually buy whichever brand of coffee happens to be on sale." 
Underwear scored a middling 36% in brand loyalty, but consumer researchers say that's actually quite high for such a mundane product. "In the past, you just wore Fruit of the Loom and didn't care," says <PERSON>Peter Kim</PERSON>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> director of consumer behavior research for the <ORGANIZATION>J. Walter Thompson</ORGANIZATION> ad agency. "The high score reflects the attempts to make underwear more of a fashion image business for both men and women." 
Meanwhile, "the bottom end of the market is becoming less loyal," says <PERSON>Laurel Cutler</PERSON>, vice chairman of the ad agency FCB/Leber <ORGANIZATION>Katz Partners</ORGANIZATION>. "They're buying whatever's cheaper." 
<PERSON>Mr. Kim</PERSON> of <PERSON>J. Walter Thompson</PERSON> doesn't think so.
Sometimes, they'll choose <PERSON>Ragu</PERSON> spaghetti sauce; other times, it will be <LOCATION>Prego</LOCATION>. 
"When there's a clutter of brands, consumers simplify the complexity by telling themselves, 'All brands are the same so what difference does it make which I buy, '" says <PERSON>Karen Olshan</PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION>BBDO</ORGANIZATION>. "Too often, advertising imagery hasn't done a good job of forging a special emotional bond between a brand and the consumer." 
Says <PERSON>Clayt Wilhite</PERSON>, president of the <PERSON>D'Arcy Masius</PERSON> ad agency's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> division, "Every time 24 hours pass without any advertising reinforcement, brand loyalty will diminish ever so slightly -- even for a powerful brand like <PERSON>Budweiser</PERSON>." 
But since returning to advertising, <ORGANIZATION>Maxwell House</ORGANIZATION> has regained the lost share and is running neck and neck with archrival <ORGANIZATION>Folgers</ORGANIZATION>. 
"Now, <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris</ORGANIZATION> {<ORGANIZATION>Kraft General Foods</ORGANIZATION>' parent company} is committed to the coffee business and to increased advertising for <ORGANIZATION>Maxwell House</ORGANIZATION>," says <PERSON>Dick Mayer</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>General Foods USA</ORGANIZATION> division. "Even though brand loyalty is rather strong for coffee, we need advertising to maintain and strengthen it." 
<ORGANIZATION>Campbell Soup Co.</ORGANIZATION>, for one, has concluded that it makes good sense to focus more on its most loyal customers than on people who buy competitive brands. "The probability of converting a non-user to your brand is about three in 1,000," says <PERSON>Tony Adams</PERSON>, the company's vice president for marketing research. "The best odds are with your core franchise.
In one consumer focus group, a fan declared that, "<PERSON>Campbell</PERSON>'s soup is like getting a hug from a friend." That helped persuade the company to introduce a new advertising slogan: "A warm hug from <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>'s." 
Getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after Hurricane Hugo ripped through the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Carolinas</LOCATION> last month.
The earthquake's toll, including possible deep structural damage, goes far beyond the more easily observed damage from a hurricane, says <PERSON>George Reider</PERSON>, a vice president in <ORGANIZATION>Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's claims division. 
Since commercial air travel is interrupted, <LOCATION>Aetna</LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION>Hartford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, chartered three planes to fly claims adjusters into <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> and then planned for them to drive to the <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area.
<ORGANIZATION>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the largest home and auto insurer in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, believes the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the $475 million in damages it expects to pay out for claims resulting from Hurricane Hugo.
State Farm, based in <LOCATION>Bloomington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION>, is also the largest writer of personal-property earthquake insurance in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. 
State <PERSON>Farm</PERSON> said about 25% of its policyholders in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> have also purchased earthquake insurance.
<ORGANIZATION>Allstate Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Sears, Roebuck & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, said about 23% of its personal property policyholders -- about 28% in the <LOCATION>San Franciso</LOCATION> area -- also have earthquake coverage. 
Officials from the <ORGANIZATION>American Insurance Association</ORGANIZATION>'s property-claim service division, which coordinates the efforts of the claims adjusters in an area after a natural disaster, will be flying to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> today.
That coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance companies including <ORGANIZATION>Fireman's Fund Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Novato</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Cigna Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>. 
"We are saying this is the breaking point, this is the event that will change the psychology of the marketplace," said <PERSON>William Yankus</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Conning & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Hartford</LOCATION> firm that specializes in the insurance industry.
Among the insurance stocks, big gainers included <ORGANIZATION>American International Group</ORGANIZATION>, up $3.25 to $102.625; <ORGANIZATION>General Re Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, up $2.75 to $86.50; <LOCATION>Aetna</LOCATION>, up $2.375 to $59.50; and <ORGANIZATION>Marsh & McLennan Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, up $3.125 to $75.875. 
Still, a few individual companies, most likely smaller ones, could be devastated. "I think there is a damned good chance someone is going to hit the skids on this," said <ORGANIZATION>Oppenheimer & Co.</ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON>Myron Picoult</PERSON>.
British, <LOCATION>West German</LOCATION>, Scandinavian and other overseas insurers are bracing for big claims from the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> earthquake disaster.
Although it's unclear how much exposure the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> market will face, <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> underwriters traditionally have a large reinsurance exposure to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> catastrophe coverage.
<PERSON>Jack Byrne</PERSON>, chairman of <PERSON>Fireman</PERSON>'s Fund, said this disaster will test the catastrophe reinsurance market, causing these rates to soar. 
<PERSON>Orin Kramer</PERSON>, an insurance consultant in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, estimates that the 1906 <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> destruction, on an inflation-adjusted basis, included insured losses of $5.8 billion.
In a move to prevent any dislocation in the financial markets from the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> earthquake, the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> said it temporarily reassigned options listed on the <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> to the American, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> stock exchanges and to the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Board Options Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Richard Breeden</PERSON> said the cooperation by the exchanges would enable investors to buy and sell options listed solely on the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> exchange, guaranteeing the liquidity of the market. 
Officials at the four exchanges said well over 50 traders from the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> exchange were taking flights from <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> late yesterday to the <LOCATION>American</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> exchanges and to the <ORGANIZATION>CBOE</ORGANIZATION>, where they would continue making markets in the Pacific-listed options.
The <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> said carpenters quickly erected a new options floor to accomodate 40 traders from the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> exchange.
Trading was light on the <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> yesterday, with workers at the exchange's main floor in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> struggling to execute orders by flashlight as a result of a continuing power outage. 
The <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> exchange has options for 129 underlying stock issues, including highly active <ORGANIZATION>Hilton Hotels Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which is listed on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>.
But professionals said throughout the day that the shutdown wouldn't be a cause for alarm even if it were to persist for several days. "I've told my staff and clients that they still have the ability to exercise their options, because they are guaranteed by the <ORGANIZATION>Options Clearing Corp.</ORGANIZATION>," said <PERSON>Michael Schwartz</PERSON>, a senior registered options strategist at <ORGANIZATION>Oppenheimer & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
While the exchange's equities floor in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> remained open on a limited basis, orders were being routed and executed in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
Because the exchange's computer was rerouting orders to the exchange's trading operations in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, "business is as usual" <PERSON>Mr. Vyas</PERSON> said. "If one city is down, the other can take over." 
<PERSON>Charles Daggs</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Sutro & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, said traders came to work at 5 a.m. PDT -- many on foot because of uncertain road and traffic conditions -- but learned that they would have to await a required inspection by the city in order to turn the power back on at the company's two main facilities there.
The traders were executing municipal bond, mutual fund and other orders through a sister firm, <ORGANIZATION>Tucker Anthony Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which is also owned by <ORGANIZATION>John Hancock Freedom Securities</ORGANIZATION> but is based in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. "We are having a regular day.
Volume is down out of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, but not out of the 11 outlying offices," <PERSON>Mr. Daggs</PERSON> added.
<PERSON>Sutro</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Oakland</ORGANIZATION> office executed orders through the <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> office, which wasn't affected by the quake. 
Others, like <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which has eight offices in the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> area, set up an 800 number yesterday morning for customers to obtain market commentary and other help. 
At <ORGANIZATION>Kidder, Peabody & Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> branch, Manager <PERSON>Janet White</PERSON> received calls yesterday morning from workers in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> who offered to work in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>.
Then she discovered that <ORGANIZATION>Quotron Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> lines were down, because they are normally tied in through a system that goes through <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
At <LOCATION>Quotron</LOCATION>, the company's <ORGANIZATION>National Call-In Center</ORGANIZATION>, which swung into action for the first time last month for Hurricane Hugo, assembled a tactical team at 5 a.m. yesterday to begin rerouting lines and restore service to brokers and traders.
Service appeared to be down throughout the financial district in downtown <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, while just parts of <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> were knocked out.
But <PERSON>Dale Irvine</PERSON>, director of the emergency center, said service was being restored to outlying <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> areas. 
In <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Options Clearing</ORGANIZATION> confirmed that it guarantees the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> exchange options.
The firm also will permit its members and the public "to exercise their put and call options contracts traded on the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> exchange" even if the exchange is closed, said <PERSON>Wayne Luthringshausen</PERSON>, chairman of Options Clearing. (Put options give holders the right, but not the obligation, to sell a financial instrument at a specified price, while call options give holders the right, but not the obligation, to buy a financial instrument at a specified price). 
Investors and traders in <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> exchange options "are protected to the extent that they can convert their put and call options into the underlying instrument," <PERSON>Mr. Luthringshausen</PERSON> said. "We are seeing such exercises today, in fact." 
Brokerage houses jumped in, touting "post-quake demand" stocks, and <ORGANIZATION>Kidder, Peabody & Co.</ORGANIZATION> set up a toll-free hot line for <LOCATION>San Franciscans</LOCATION> who might need emergency investment advice and help in transferring funds. 
"Wall Street thinks of everything in terms of money," says <PERSON>Tom Gallagher</PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION>Oppenheimer & Co.</ORGANIZATION> trader.
The most popular plays of the day were insurance companies such as <ORGANIZATION>General Re Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which rose $2.75 to $86.50, <ORGANIZATION>Nac Re Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, up $2 to $37.75, <ORGANIZATION>American International Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, up $3.25 to $102.625, and <ORGANIZATION>Cigna Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, up 87.5 cents to $62.50.
On the prospect for rebuilding northern <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, investors bid up cement-makers <ORGANIZATION>Calmat Co.</ORGANIZATION>, up $2.75 to $28.75, and <ORGANIZATION>Lone Star Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, up $1.75 to $29.25.
Bridge and road builders had a field day, including <ORGANIZATION>Kasler Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, up $2.125 to $9.875, <ORGANIZATION>Guy F. Atkinson Co.</ORGANIZATION>, up 87.5 to $61.875, and <ORGANIZATION>Morrison Knudsen Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which reported higher third-quarter earnings yesterday, up $2.25 to $44.125.
<ORGANIZATION>Georgia Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, up $1.25 to $58, and <ORGANIZATION>Maxxam Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, up $3 to $43.75, both reported strong profits.
<ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION> touted <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Louisiana Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Willamette Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> as the best post-quake plywood plays. 
<ORGANIZATION>Tosco Corp.</ORGANIZATION> jumped $1.125 to $20.125 and <ORGANIZATION>Chevron Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, despite a temporary pipeline shutdown, rose $1 to $65. 
<ORGANIZATION>Wells Fargo & Co.</ORGANIZATION> fell 50 cents to $81.50, and <ORGANIZATION>BankAmerica Corp.</ORGANIZATION> fell 50 cents to $31.875.
Some <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> thrift stocks also fell, including <ORGANIZATION>Golden West Financial Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>H.F. Ahmanson & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which reported lower earnings yesterday. 
Early yesterday, bonds rose as investors rushed to buy <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> securities on the prospect that stocks would plummet in the aftermath of the massive <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> earthquake.
With stocks not a major focus, "we're waiting for the next guiding light," said <PERSON>Brian J. Fabbri</PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION>Midland Montagu Securities Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "If the stock market tremors are behind us, then the bond market will go back to looking at the next batch of economic numbers to determine" where interest rates are heading. 
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, slashed the size of its note offering from $150 million to $71 million.
"We're being bombarded by new <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> and agency debt offerings," said <PERSON>William Sullivan Jr.</PERSON>, director of money-market research at <ORGANIZATION>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "The market is concerned about its ability to underwrite all this debt at current levels." 
In addition to the $15.6 billion of <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bills to be sold at next week's regular Monday auction, the government will sell $10 billion of new two-year <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> notes.
<ORGANIZATION>Refcorp</ORGANIZATION> is the financing unit of <ORGANIZATION>Resolution Trust Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a new government agency created to rescue the nation's troubled thrifts.
"There are certain bonds traders refer to as `earthquake' bonds because the (issuers) are on top of the <LOCATION>San Andreas</LOCATION> fault," said <PERSON>Zane Mann</PERSON>, editor of the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Municipal Bond Advisor, a newsletter for investors.
"Insurance companies will foot a substantial amount of the bill to reconstruct <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>," said <PERSON>Charles Lieberman</PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION>Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
He also expects the performance of municipals to lag <ORGANIZATION>Treasurys</ORGANIZATION> as <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> is forced to issue new debt over time to repair public facilities. 
A report issued late yesterday by <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor's Corp.</ORGANIZATION> concluded the quake won't cause "wide-scale credit deterioration" for issuers and debt issues in the 12-county area of <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION> affected by the quake. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> junk bond offering, underwritten by <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, was the only new issue priced yesterday.
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, topped the competitive slate yesterday with a sale of $200 million of general obligation tax revenue anticipation notes. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Federal National Mortgage Association</ORGANIZATION>, two dominant issuers of mortgage securities, have a sizable amount of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> home loans in their mortgagebacked pools. 
And because <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION> home prices are so high, loans from the region often are too large to be included in <ORGANIZATION>Freddie Mac</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Fannie Mae</ORGANIZATION> pools. 
<PERSON>Sen. Bob Packwood</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>), the lead sponsor of the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> proposal, said he intends to unveil the plan today and to offer it as an amendment to whatever legislation comes along, particularly this month's bill to raise the federal borrowing limit. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Packwood</ORGANIZATION> plan would also include a proposal, designed by <PERSON>Sen. William Roth</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Del.</LOCATION>), that would expand and alter the deduction for individual retirement accounts.
No one in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> is considering the capital-gains plan passed by the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>.
Separately, Chairman <PERSON>Dan Rostenkowski</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>) of the <ORGANIZATION>House Ways and Means Committee</ORGANIZATION> said he didn't want the capital-gains tax cut or any other amendments attached to the pending bill raising the federal borrowing limit.
He also urged <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> negotiators to rid the deficit-reduction bill of all provisions that increase the budget deficit, including the House-passed capital-gains provision. 
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris</ORGANIZATION> closed at $43.375, up 12.5 cents. 
<PERSON>Philip Morris</PERSON> disclosed little detailed information about performance by major business lines except to say that most, including <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris U.S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Kraft General Foods and Miller Brewing Co.</ORGANIZATION>, posted increased revenues. 
<ORGANIZATION>Intel Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Advanced Micro Devices Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>National Semiconductor Corp.</ORGANIZATION> were all up and running yesterday, though many workers were forced to stay home because of damaged roadways; others elected to take the day off. 
"These systems are more rugged than many people would believe," said <PERSON>Thomas Kurlak</PERSON>, who tracks the computer industry for <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch Research</ORGANIZATION>. "It's not the end of the world if you shake them up a little bit." 
Other companies, including <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard Co.</ORGANIZATION>, completely idled their operations because of Tuesday evening's temblor, which registered 6.9 on the <PERSON>Richter</PERSON> scale.
Still, many were confident that "in a day or two, everything should be back to normal," according to a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION>Semiconductor Industry Association</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Cupertino</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>, for instance, said it anticipates returning to a normal work schedule by the weekend at its <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> plant, which puts out disk drives for the 3090 family of mainframes.
A <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said that, while "things are a big mess," some 18,000 <LOCATION>Valley</LOCATION> employees have been called back to work today. 
<ORGANIZATION>Sun Microsystems Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Tandem Computers Inc.</ORGANIZATION> also signaled that they should recover quickly. 
<ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, with major facilities in <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cupertino</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Palo Alto</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Mountain View</LOCATION>, said that all of its engineering and manufacturing sites had reported to corporate headquarters in <LOCATION>Maynard</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, Tuesday night.
For example, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Advanced Micro Devices</ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION>Sunnyvale</ORGANIZATION> chip maker is worried about blackouts.
Several factors apparently spared the <LOCATION>Valley</LOCATION> -- a sprawling suburban stretch from <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION> -- from the kind of impact felt in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, an hour's drive north.
Also, the soil in the <LOCATION>Valley</LOCATION> is solid, unlike the landfill of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s downtown <ORGANIZATION>Marina District</ORGANIZATION>, which was hit with fires and vast destruction. 
That's certainly good news for such companies as <ORGANIZATION>Compaq Computer Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, which has only a four-day supply of microprocessors from the <LOCATION>Valley</LOCATION> on hand because of a just-in-time manufacturing approach that limits the buildup of inventory.
<ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment</ORGANIZATION> has set up disaster-recovery response centers in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Colorado Springs</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo</LOCATION>.
These units were handling calls both from people in the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> area and from computers themselves, which are set to dial <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION> automatically when trouble arises.
<ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION> also said it has dispatched teams of technicians to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. 
Meanwhile, several other major installations around the <LOCATION>Valley</LOCATION> -- <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s center of high-tech -- said they, too, fared as well as could be expected.
<ORGANIZATION>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION>Energy Department</ORGANIZATION> tests and conducts research on nuclear weapons, had only "superficial damage," a spokesman said. 
At <ORGANIZATION>Lockheed Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's missiles and space systems group in <LOCATION>Sunnyvale</LOCATION>, about 40 miles south of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, workers were asked to head to work yesterday after it was realized that "there were no show-stoppers" in the 150-plus buildings on its one-square-mile campus. 
One of <ORGANIZATION>Lockheed</ORGANIZATION>'s most lucrative sectors -- accounting for more than half the aerospace company's $10.59 billion in sales in 1988 -- the missiles and space group is the prime <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> contractor on the Trident II ballistic missile.
Fortunately, the <ORGANIZATION>Hubble Space Telescope</ORGANIZATION> -- set to be launched on the shuttle next year in a search for distant solar systems and light emitted 14 billion years ago from the farthest reaches of the universe -- was moved from <LOCATION>Sunnyvale</LOCATION> to the Kennedy Space Center in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> at the beginning of October. 
<ORGANIZATION>Enron Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said a subsidiary and two <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> firms are studying the feasibility of constructing a 1,500 megawatt gas-fired power plant in northern <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> as an outgrowth of the government's privatization program. 
<ORGANIZATION>Enron Power Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of the <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> natural gas pipeline company, would design, construct and run the plant.
A subsidiary of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Chemical Industries</ORGANIZATION> would buy electricity and steam from the proposed station.
Also participating in the study, <PERSON>Enron</PERSON> said, is the <ORGANIZATION>National Power</ORGANIZATION> division of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Central Electricity Generating Board</ORGANIZATION>. 
In <LOCATION>Armonk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, a spokesman said that although <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> didn't view its spending as necessarily a way to support the stock, it thought the purchases were a good way to improve such financial measurements as per-share earnings and return on equity. 
<PERSON>Steve Milunovich</PERSON>, a securities analyst at <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION>, said that while investors were looking for an excuse to buy <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> shares a year ago, even the big institutional investors are looking for a reason to avoid the stock these days. 
<LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Tom Bradley</PERSON> used the opportunity to push the <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> harder to pass a measure establishing a loss-recovery reserve of $100 million.
After <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> Mayor Art Agnos spoke on television of the need for building inspectors to check the soundness of buildings, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> dispatched 32 inspectors to help.
And the county of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> placed its firefighters and sheriffs on alert, ready to send in reinforcements, and alerted <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> that the city has 1,000 hospital beds at its disposal. 
Two <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> radio stations initiated <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> donation campaigns, and one <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> bank manager forked over $150,000 of his own money for relief purposes, the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> said. 
It is also pulling 20 people out of <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, who were helping <PERSON>Huricane Hugo</PERSON> victims, and sending them to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> instead. 
Like almost everything in this wonderfully romantic and edgy movie, <PERSON>Ms. Pfeiffer</PERSON>'s Susie seems like someone you've seen before, in numerous show-biz stories (even her name, <PERSON>Susie Diamond</PERSON>, sounds like a character <PERSON>Marilyn Monroe</PERSON> must have played).
Yet nothing about "<PERSON>Baker Boys</PERSON>," and certainly nothing about <PERSON>Ms. Pfeiffer</PERSON>, really is like something from the video vault. 
However, <PERSON>Mr. Kloves</PERSON> directs his own material without sentimentality and at its own eccentric pace; "<ORGANIZATION>Baker Boys</ORGANIZATION>" is both bluesy and funny. 
After working for years with <PERSON>Werner Rainer Fassbinder</PERSON>, the late German director, and more recently with <PERSON>Martin Scorsese</PERSON> ("After Hours," "The Color of Money," "The Last Temptation of Christ"), <PERSON>Mr. Ballhaus</PERSON> has developed a distinctively fluid style.
What seemed like a good idea, to cast the Bridges brothers (<PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> and <PERSON>Beau</PERSON>) as the <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> brothers, actually turned out to be a good idea.
So it's quite possible that the terrific play between the brothers isn't natural at all, that <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> and <PERSON>Beau</PERSON> had to work like crazy to make their brotherly love -- and resentment and frustration and rage -- seem so very real. 
<PERSON>Plump Beau</PERSON>, looking eager to please with his arched eyebrows and round face, plays the older brother, <PERSON>Frank</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Jeff Bridges</PERSON> is the younger brother, <PERSON>Jack</PERSON>, who fancies himself the rebellious artist; he lives in a loft with his sick dog and the occasional visit from the little girl upstairs, who climbs down the fire escape.
Looking leaner than he has in a while, the younger <PERSON>Mr. Bridges</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> is sexy and cynical and a far sadder case than <PERSON>Frank</PERSON>, who's managed to chisel his dreams to fit reality without feeling too cheated.
These include <PERSON>Jennifer Tilly</PERSON>'s audition to be the <ORGANIZATION>Baker Boys</ORGANIZATION>' girl singer.
<PERSON>Ms. Tilly</PERSON> of the tweety-bird voice showed great comic promise during her stint as the mobster's girlfriend on the television show, "Hill Street Blues." Here she delivers, especially during her enthusiastically awful rendition of the "Candy Man," which she sings while prancing around in a little cotton candy pink angora sweater that couldn't be more perfect. (It matches her voice.) And <PERSON>Ms. Pfeiffer</PERSON>'s particular version of "Making Whoopee" -- and the way <PERSON>Mr. Ballhaus</PERSON> photographs her, from the tips of her red high heels right up her clingy red velvet dress -- might make you think of <PERSON>Marilyn Monroe</PERSON> if <PERSON>Ms. Pfeiffer</PERSON> hadn't gone and become a star in her own right. 
<PERSON>Christopher Whittington</PERSON>, 51-year-old deputy chairman of this British investment-banking group and chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Grenfell & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the group's main banking unit, has retired from his executive duties.
Succeeding <PERSON>Mr. Whittington</PERSON> as deputy chairman of the group is <PERSON>Anthony Richmond-Watson</PERSON>, 43, currently a main board member.
Succeeding <PERSON>Mr. Whittington</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Grenfell & Co.</ORGANIZATION> is <PERSON>Richard Webb</PERSON>, 50, currently deputy chairman.
<PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> was the subject of a page one profile in The Wall Street Journal in 1984, after the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> questioned him about ties between him and companies he touted in a newsletter.
In 1986, in another consent agreement with the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> was enjoined from violating the stock-registration and anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws.
Without any admission or denial of guilt by <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON>, that agreement settled <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> charges that <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> sold unregistered securities and misled investors. 
In charges filed last week in federal district court in <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> alleged that <ORGANIZATION>Venture Capitalists Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Venture Finance Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>New Ventures Fund Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, all of <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>, failed repeatedly to file proper documents.
The <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> also charged that <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> acted as an officer or director of <ORGANIZATION>New Ventures</ORGANIZATION>, in violation of his previous consent agreement. 
Two of <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON>'s business associates who worked for <ORGANIZATION>Venture Capitalists</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Kimberly Ann Smith</PERSON> and <PERSON>Frederick Byrum</PERSON>, also consented to being enjoined from violations of registration provisions of the securities laws.
<PERSON>Mr. Byrum</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ms. Smith</PERSON> couldn't be reached for comment.
<ORGANIZATION>Consolidated Rail Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, reported that third-quarter net income climbed 4.8% to $87 million, or $1.27 a share, exceeding analysts' expectations. 
For the rest of 1989, <PERSON>Mr. Hagen</PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION>Conrail</ORGANIZATION>'s traffic and revenue "will reflect the sluggish economy, but <ORGANIZATION>Conrail</ORGANIZATION> will continue to take steps to control and reduce costs." 
<ORGANIZATION>Continental Bank Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's third-quarter net income slipped 11% despite a big gain from the sale of the company's <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> headquarters building. 
Gen. <PERSON>Paul X. Kelley</PERSON>, retired commandant of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Marine Corps</ORGANIZATION>, was elected a director of this plastics, specialty materials and aerospace concern, succeeding <PERSON>Jewel Lafontant</PERSON>, who resigned to accept a government position. 
<ORGANIZATION>Bally Manufacturing Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> developer <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> have agreed in principle to a $6.5 million settlement of shareholder litigation stemming from <ORGANIZATION>Bally</ORGANIZATION>'s alleged greenmail payment to <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>. 
According to lawyers familiar with the settlement talks, the verbal agreement to end a lawsuit filed more than two years ago was reached last week and will soon be submitted to a federal judge in <LOCATION>Camden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION> 
In February 1987, <ORGANIZATION>Bally</ORGANIZATION> thwarted a possible hostile takeover bid from <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> by agreeing to buy 2.6 million of <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>'s 3.1 million Bally shares for $83.7 million -- more than $18 million above market price.
Lawyers for shareholders, <ORGANIZATION>Bally</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> all declined to talk publicly about the proposed settlement, citing a request by a federal court magistrate not to reveal details of the agreement until it is completed. 
But some attorneys who are familiar with the matter said the $6.5 million payment will be shared by <ORGANIZATION>Bally</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>, with the casino and hotel concern probably paying the bulk of the money. 
The amount <ORGANIZATION>Bally</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> will pay to settle the class-action suit pales in comparison to the $45 million <ORGANIZATION>Walt Disney Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Saul Steinberg</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Reliance Group Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay to settle a similar suit in July.
But lawyers said <PERSON>Mr. Steinberg</PERSON> probably faced much more potential liability because, when he sued <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> during his takeover battle, he filed on behalf of all shareholders.
When <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> offered to pay <PERSON>Mr. Steinberg</PERSON> a premium for his shares, the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor didn't demand the company also pay a premium to other shareholders.
When <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> sued <ORGANIZATION>Bally</ORGANIZATION>, he sued only on behalf of himself. 
<PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Bally</ORGANIZATION> also appeared to have some leverage in the case because in the state of <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Bally</PERSON> is incorporated, courts have held that greenmail is often protected by the business-judgment rule.
Yesterday, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <PERSON>Judge Alcee Hastings</PERSON> faced his jury -- the full <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> -- and said, "I am not guilty of having committed any crime." 
Seventeen articles of impeachment against the <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> judge, one of the few blacks on the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> bench, were approved by the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> in August 1988.
The central charge against <PERSON>Judge Hastings</PERSON> is that he conspired with a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> lawyer to obtain a $150,000 bribe from defendants in a criminal case before the judge, in return for leniency.
The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>'s public gallery was packed with <PERSON>Judge Hastings</PERSON>' supporters, who erupted into applause after he finished his argument.
But Rep. <PERSON>John Bryant</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>), the lead counsel for the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> managers who conducted a lengthy inquiry into <PERSON>Judge Hastings</PERSON>' activities, said "a mountain of evidence points to his certain guilt." 
However, <PERSON>Judge Hastings</PERSON> has said he will continue to fight and is contemplating an appeal of any impeachment to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>. 
In a case involving <ORGANIZATION>Avondale Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and its insurer, <ORGANIZATION>Travelers Cos.</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> ruled in favor of the company on two issues that lawyers say are central to dozens of pollution cases around the country. 
"This decision will have a very considerable impact," said <PERSON>Kenneth Abraham</PERSON>, professor of environmental law and insurance law at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION>, because many commercial insurance policies are issued by companies based in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>William Greaney</PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION>Chemical Manufacturers Association</ORGANIZATION>, said that while other appeals courts have ruled differently on whether cleanup costs are damages, the influence of the appeals court in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> "will make insurers sit up and listen." He said the decision was the first in which a federal appeals court has ruled whether administrative government proceedings qualify as litigation. 
<PERSON>Barry R. Ostrager</PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION>Travelers</ORGANIZATION>, said, "there are procedural bases on which this case will be appealed further." 
"The report provides detailed documentation of the extent and nature of the problem and indicates how we may want to shape solutions," said <PERSON>Joseph Genova</PERSON>, chairman of the committee that oversaw the survey and a partner at the law firm of <ORGANIZATION>Milbank</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Tweed</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Hadley & McCloy</ORGANIZATION>. 
PROSECUTOR TO JOIN <PERSON>Gibson Dunn</PERSON>: Assistant <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON>Randy Mastro</PERSON>, who headed the government's racketeering case against the <ORGANIZATION>International Brotherhood of Teamsters</ORGANIZATION>, will join <PERSON>Gibson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Dunn & Crutcher</ORGANIZATION> in its <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> office.
<PERSON>Mr. Mastro</PERSON> has been with the <LOCATION>New York U.S.</LOCATION> attorney's office for nearly five years.
<PERSON>Mr. Mastro</PERSON> will do civil litigation and white-collar defense work for <ORGANIZATION>Gibson Dunn</ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. 
FORMER <ORGANIZATION>APPLE COMPUTER Inc.</ORGANIZATION> general counsel <PERSON>John P. Karalis</PERSON> has joined the <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, law firm of <ORGANIZATION>Brown & Bain</ORGANIZATION>.
Before joining Apple in 1986, <PERSON>Mr. Karalis</PERSON> served as general counsel at <ORGANIZATION>Sperry Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>John E. Hayes Jr.</PERSON> was elected chairman, president and chief executive officer, succeeding <PERSON>David S. Black</PERSON>, who retired.
<PERSON>Mr. Hayes</PERSON>, 52 years old, left <ORGANIZATION>Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.</ORGANIZATION> in January, where he had been chairman, president and chief executive, to join <ORGANIZATION>Triad Capital Partners</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> company with interests in solid waste and recycling, telecommunications and international venture capital.
<ORGANIZATION>Kansas Power</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Mr. Black</PERSON>, 61, chose early retirement. 
<ORGANIZATION>Wang Laboratories Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Lowell</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, beset by declining demand for its computers, reported a $62.1 million, 38-cents-a-share loss in its first quarter ended Sept. 30.
<ORGANIZATION>General Dynamics Corp.</ORGANIZATION> was awarded contracts totaling $589 million for one <ORGANIZATION>Navy Trident</ORGANIZATION> submarine and for <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> research on the <ORGANIZATION>National Aerospace</ORGANIZATION> plane. 
<ORGANIZATION>Grumman Corp.</ORGANIZATION> won a $58.9 million <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> contract for 12 F-14 aircraft. 
<ORGANIZATION>Raytheon Co.</ORGANIZATION> was issued a $19.2 million <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> contract for support of the <ORGANIZATION>Milstar</ORGANIZATION> communications satellite. 
<ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas Corp.</ORGANIZATION> got a $12.5 million <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> contract for support work on the <ORGANIZATION>National Aerospace</ORGANIZATION> plane. 
In composite <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> trading, stock in <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Gulf</ORGANIZATION>, which has been mentioned as a takeover candidate, rose $2.125 a share to close at $46.125. 
<ORGANIZATION>Granges Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, citing depressed gold prices, said it plans to suspend operations for an indefinite period at its Tartan gold mine in <LOCATION>Manitoba</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Granges</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>British Columbia</LOCATION>, that the production halt will be phased in over a 10-week period.
<PERSON>Granges</PERSON> said it also plans in the third quarter to write down the carrying value of the <LOCATION>Tartan</LOCATION> mine by 2.5 million Canadian dollars (US$ 2.12 million), and to write off most of the C$6.3 million carrying value of its Windflower gold property in <LOCATION>British Columbia</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>Lotus</LOCATION>'s results were about 10% higher than analysts' average expectations and compared favorably with the 36% earnings rise reported a day earlier by rival <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Redmond</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Rick Sherlund</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs</ORGANIZATION> analyst, said <PERSON>Lotus</PERSON> had upgrade revenue of about $22 million in the quarter, twice what he had expected.
Demand for the new version was enabling <LOCATION>Lotus</LOCATION> to raise prices with distributors and to hold market share against <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> and other competitors that tried to exploit the earlier delays in Release 3's launch, <PERSON>Mr. Sherlund</PERSON> added.
<ORGANIZATION>Bank Building</ORGANIZATION> earlier said the restatement is necessitated by "certain errors in recording receivables and payables" at its <ORGANIZATION>Loughman Cabinet</ORGANIZATION> division.
In <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>Bank Building</ORGANIZATION> closed at $4 a share, down 62.5 cents. 
Summarizing data derived from a March 1989 survey of 58,000 households, <PERSON>William Butz</PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, said that "most groups either stayed the same or improved." But, he added, "Since the late 1960s, the distribution of income has been slowly getting less equal.
The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> counts all cash income in determining whether families are below the line, but it doesn't consider other government benefits, such as <ORGANIZATION>Medicare</ORGANIZATION>. 
It rose sharply in the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> and fell slightly in the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>.
Private relief agencies, such as the <ORGANIZATION>Salvation Army</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION>, mobilized almost instantly to help people, while the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> bureaucracy "took hours getting into gear." One news show we saw yesterday even displayed 25 federal officials meeting around a table.
The debentures were issued in the face amount of $46 million on July 11, 1988, the <LOCATION>Ashland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>, coal mining, water transportation and construction company said.
It puts great strain on a longstanding <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> friendship with <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION>, a country that has been one of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s strongest allies in <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION>.
The resolution also comes at a time when <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> has been seeking help from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in resolving its Bulgarian emigration controversy and pursuing democratic reforms that may lead to membership in the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>. 
Such sentiment only encourages the adverse feelings toward <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> that surfaced when <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> asked for assistance in dealing with its Bulgarian emigration crisis. 
<PERSON>Mr. Dole</PERSON>'s odd effort notwithstanding, most of <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION>'s political problems lie with the Europeans.
Part of the problem some Europeans have with <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> seems to stem from its location -- <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> isn't really part of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
Another anti-Turkish hook is the Islamic faith of the majority of the <LOCATION>Turkish</LOCATION> people: <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION>, we are told, is not a <ORGANIZATION>Christian</ORGANIZATION> nation; its people simply won't fit in with the Western European Judeo-Christian tradition.
Kurds, suffering what many people consider to be a current extermination campaign at the hands of <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> have inundated eastern <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Bulgaria</LOCATION>'s government has been behaving beyond the pale for months, and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> does its values no credit by ignoring that while casting its votes into the past. 
And until last Friday, it seemed those efforts were starting to pay off. "Some of those folks were coming back," says <PERSON>Leslie Quick Jr.</PERSON>, chairman, of discount brokers <ORGANIZATION>Quick & Reilly Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "We had heard from people who hadn't been active" for a long time. 
"It's going to set things back for a period, because it reinforces the concern of volatility," says <PERSON>Jeffrey B. Lane</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "I think it will shake confidence one more time, and a lot of this business is based on client confidence." 
"The kinds of questions you had before have resurfaced," says <PERSON>Raymond A.</PERSON> "Chip" <PERSON>Mason</PERSON>, chairman of regional brokerage firm <ORGANIZATION>Legg Mason Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>. "I can just tell the questions are right back where they were: `What's going on?,' `Can't anything be done about program trading?,' `Doesn't the exchange understand?,' `Where is the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> on this? '" 
But "these wide swings scare them to death." All of this is bad news for the big brokerage firms such as <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION> that have big "retail," or individual-investor, businesses.
A slightly higher percentage of <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> volume has been attributed to retail investors in recent months compared with post-crash 1988, according to <ORGANIZATION>Securities Industry Association</ORGANIZATION> data.
<PERSON>Jeffrey Schaefer</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>SIA</ORGANIZATION>'s research director, says that all of his group's retail-volume statistics could be overstated by as much as five percentage points because corporate buy-backs are sometimes inadvertently included in <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> data.
With the gyrations of recent days, says <PERSON>Hugo Quackenbush</PERSON>, senior vice president at <PERSON>Charles Schwab</PERSON>, many small investors are absolutely convinced that "they shouldn't play in the stock market." 
<PERSON>Joseph Grano</PERSON>, president of retail sales and marketing at <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, still thinks that individual investors will eventually go back into the stock market.
Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION> remains among the leaders in efforts to simply persuade investors to keep giving Wall Street their money. "It's more of an important issue to keep control of those assets, rather than push the investor to move into (specific) products such as equities," <PERSON>Mr. Grano</PERSON> says. "The equity decision will come when the client is ready and when there's a semblance of confidence." 
It could be a long wait, say some industry observers. "Some investors will tiptoe back in," says <PERSON>Richard Ross</PERSON>, a market research director for <ORGANIZATION>Elrick & Lavidge</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. "Then there'll be another swing.
<PERSON>Mr. Ross</PERSON>, who has been studying retail investors' perception of risks in the brokerage industry, said a market plunge like Friday's "shatters investors' confidence in their ability to make any judgments on the market." The long-term outlook for the retail brokerage business is "miserable," <PERSON>Mr. Ross</PERSON> declares. 
Food companies probably won't cut their prices much, blaming other costs. "Labor takes the biggest single chunk out of the `food dollar, '" says <PERSON>Frank Pankyo</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Food Institute</ORGANIZATION>.

But the utility may not continue next year. "We're on a tight budget," says <ORGANIZATION>Detroit Edison</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Carol Roskind</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Scott E. Thomas</PERSON> says the plans give employees "a bonus in the form of charitable donations made from an employer's treasury" in exchange for the political donation. "The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government could be, in effect, subsidizing political contributions to corporate PACs," he says.
<ORGANIZATION>Spiegel</ORGANIZATION>, which also owns <PERSON>Eddie Bauer</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Honeybee</LOCATION>, says that since 1987, sales have doubled during the week before Christmas.
An <ORGANIZATION>L.L. Bean</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman notes: "People are just used to living in a last-minute society." Blunt <PERSON>Ellis</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Milwaukee</ORGANIZATION> brokerage firm, says part of the reason catalog sales grow in popularity is because consumers have more money but less time to spend it.

As the citizens of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and surrounding communities began assessing the damage from Tuesday's devastating earthquake, <ORGANIZATION>NBC News</ORGANIZATION> began assessing the damage from what some said was a failure to provide comprehensive coverage in the earthquake's initial moments. 
"In terms of coverage, it was a disaster equal to the earthquakes," said <PERSON>Eric Premner</PERSON>, president for broadcasting of <ORGANIZATION>King Broadcasting Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which owns the <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> affiliate in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash</LOCATION>. 
While rival <ORGANIZATION>ABC News</ORGANIZATION> outstripped the competition in live coverage of the event by sheer luck -- the network was broadcasting the World Series from Candlestick Park when the quake struck -- <ORGANIZATION>NBC News</ORGANIZATION> was unable to get its signal out of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> for the first hour after the quake. 
"I have to attribute the lackluster performance to a natural disaster," said <PERSON>Mr. Premner</PERSON>. "So before I start to be really critical of <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>, I would like to know more about what happened." 
There were no complaints from affiliates of <ORGANIZATION>CBS Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Cable News Network</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Turner Broadcasting System Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
"I was not pleased with the slow start, and neither was NBC News," said <PERSON>Guy Hempel</PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> affiliate WAVE in <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky</LOCATION>. 
A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>National Broadcasting Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION>, said the network was "looking into what happened." The stations said they were pleased with the extended coverage yesterday, including a special five-hour edition of "Today." 
<PERSON>Don Browne</PERSON>, director of news at <ORGANIZATION>NBC News</ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview that "we couldn't get a signal out of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Federal Paper Board Co.</ORGANIZATION> said it completed the previously announced purchase of <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Cup Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a closely held maker of paper cups based in <LOCATION>Kenton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>G.D. Searle & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Monsanto Co.</ORGANIZATION> unit, is launching a program to give consumers more information about its drugs when doctors prescribe them. 
Consumer groups have long advocated that drug companies and doctors make more information available to patients. "We believe that every drug that's marketed to a consumer should have a consumer label," said <PERSON>Douglas Teich</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Public Citizen Health Research Group</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Ralph Nader</ORGANIZATION> affiliate.
<PERSON>Dr. Teich</PERSON> said <PERSON>Searle</PERSON> is "the only company I know that voluntarily" will make consumer information available. 
According to federal officials and drug-industry studies, nearly half of the 1.6 billion prescriptions filled each year aren't used properly, meaning that money is wasted on some prescriptions and patients are deprived of the benefits of medication. "We think it's very important to provide as much information as possible on the drugs consumers take," said <ORGANIZATION>Searle</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Sheldon Gilgore</PERSON>. 
I expected to see more volatility as some of the institutions who were spooked last Friday did some selling," said <PERSON>Raymond F. DeVoe</PERSON>, a market strategist at <ORGANIZATION>Legg Mason Wood Walker</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Marsh & McLennan</ORGANIZATION> advanced 3 1/8 to 75 7/8, <ORGANIZATION>Alexander & Alexander Services</ORGANIZATION> climbed 2 to 32 and <ORGANIZATION>Corroon & Black</ORGANIZATION> firmed 1 7/8 to 37 1/2. 
Elsewhere in the group, <ORGANIZATION>General Re</ORGANIZATION> rose 2 3/4 to 86 1/2, <ORGANIZATION>American International Group</ORGANIZATION> gained 3 1/4 to 102 5/8, <ORGANIZATION>Aetna Life & Casualty</ORGANIZATION> added 2 3/8 to 59 1/2 and <ORGANIZATION>Cigna</ORGANIZATION> advanced 7/8 to 62 1/2.
<PERSON>Loews</PERSON>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION>CNA Financial</ORGANIZATION>, rose 1 3/8 to 123 1/8. 
The heavy-construction sector was the session's best performer among <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> industry groups; Fluor rose 3/4 to 33 3/8, <PERSON>Morrison Knudsen</PERSON> gained 2 1/4 to 44 1/8, <PERSON>Foster Wheeler</PERSON> added 3/8 to 18 1/4 and <LOCATION>Ameron</LOCATION> climbed 2 3/8 to 39 3/4. 
Among engineering firms, <ORGANIZATION>CRS Sirrine</ORGANIZATION> rose 5/8 to 34 1/4 on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> and four others rallied on the <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>: <ORGANIZATION>Jacobs Engineering Group</ORGANIZATION>, which gained 1 1/8 to 25 3/8, Greiner Engineering, which rose 3 1/2 to 22 1/2; <PERSON>Michael Baker</PERSON>, which added 1 1/4 to 15 1/4, and <ORGANIZATION>American Science & Engineering</ORGANIZATION>, up 1/2 to 8 1/2. 
Within the building-materials group, <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> climbed 1 1/4 to 58 and <ORGANIZATION>Louisiana-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> added 1 to 40 3/4 after <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION> recommended the forest-products issues.
CalMat advanced 2 3/4 to 28 3/4, <ORGANIZATION>Lone Star Industries</ORGANIZATION> gained 1 3/4 to 29 1/4, <ORGANIZATION>Lafarge</ORGANIZATION> rose 1 to 19 1/2, <PERSON>Southdown</PERSON> added 5/8 to 24 5/8 and <ORGANIZATION>Eljer Industries</ORGANIZATION> rose 1 1/4 to 24 7/8. 
<ORGANIZATION>Pacific Gas & Electric</ORGANIZATION> fell 3/8 to 19 5/8 in <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> composite trading of 1.7 million shares and <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Telesis Group</ORGANIZATION> slipped 5/8 to 44 5/8 as the companies worked to restore service to areas affected by the quake. 
The company, based in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, said it had to shut down a crude-oil pipeline in the <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area to check for leaks but added that its refinery in nearby <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, was undamaged. 
Other companies based in the area include <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard</ORGANIZATION>, which rose 1/4 to 49; <ORGANIZATION>National Semiconductor</ORGANIZATION>, which went up 1/4 to 7 5/8, and <ORGANIZATION>Genentech</ORGANIZATION>, which eased 1/4 to 19 5/8.
<ORGANIZATION>BankAmerica</ORGANIZATION> eased 1/2 to 31 7/8 and <ORGANIZATION>Wells Fargo</ORGANIZATION> lost 1/2 to 81 1/2; the two bank holding companies, based in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, were forced to curtail some operations due to the temblor.
Among <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> savings-and-loan stocks, <ORGANIZATION>H.F. Ahmanson</ORGANIZATION> eased 3/8 to 22 1/4, <ORGANIZATION>CalFed</ORGANIZATION> slid 3/4 to 24 1/8, <ORGANIZATION>Great Western Financial</ORGANIZATION> dropped 1/2 to 21 1/4 and <ORGANIZATION>Golden West Financial</ORGANIZATION> fell 5/8 to 29 1/4. 
<ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>, the parent company of <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, swung within a 14-point range during the course of the session before closing at 191 3/4, down 6 1/4, on 2.3 million shares. 
<ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION>, a member of the group that had offered $300 a share for <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> in a leveraged buy-out, said it had yet to receive a revised proposal and it was "in no way committed" to the completion of a bid.
While <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> faltered, <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, pulled out of its recent nosedive by rising 3/4 to 74.
The stock had been on the decline since the financing for the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> buy-out fell through on Friday and developer <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> subsequently withdrew a takeover offer of $120 a share for <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION>. Also, <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> was the most active <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> issue; 2.8 million shares changed hands. 
<PERSON>Victor C. Benda</PERSON>, 58, formerly executive vice president, succeeds <PERSON>Mr. Lang</PERSON> as president and becomes chief operating officer, a new post. 
After failing to find a buyer for the Sears Tower in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Sears, Roebuck & Co.</ORGANIZATION> is negotiating with <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> pension fund adviser <ORGANIZATION>Aldrich</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Eastman & Waltch Inc.</ORGANIZATION> to refinance the property for close to $850 million, according to people close to the negotiations. 
At the end of the term of the convertible loan, <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION> could still own half the building, and <ORGANIZATION>AEW</ORGANIZATION> could own the other half.
Last summer, <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION> appeared to have a deal with Canadian developer <ORGANIZATION>Olympia & York Developments Ltd</ORGANIZATION>.
Real estate industry executives said <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION>' investment banker, <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, sought financing in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
Sears then went back to <ORGANIZATION>AEW</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> pension adviser that had proposed a convertible debt deal during the first round of bids last spring.
<ORGANIZATION>B.A.T Industries PLC</ORGANIZATION> may delay aspects of its defensive restructuring plan -- including the sale of its <ORGANIZATION>Saks Fifth Avenue</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Marshall Field</ORGANIZATION> units -- in the wake of the current upheaval in financial markets, company officials said. 
The <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> conglomerate, planning its own defensive restructuring to fight off a #13.35 billion ($21.03 billion) takeover bid by <ORGANIZATION>Anglo-French</ORGANIZATION> financier Sir <PERSON>James Goldsmith</PERSON>, intends to press ahead with an extraordinary shareholder vote today to clear the way for its value-boosting measures.
If anything, the gyrations in world stock markets -- and in <ORGANIZATION>B.A.T</ORGANIZATION>'s share price -- since last Friday's sharp Wall Street sell-off have increased the likelihood of shareholder approval for the restructuring, analysts and several big institutional holders said. "Thank God we have some deal on the table," said <PERSON>Stewart Gilchrist</PERSON>, a director at <ORGANIZATION>Scottish Amicable Investment Managers</ORGANIZATION>, which intends to vote its roughly 1% stake in favor of the restructuring. 
But this week, B.A.T has been hit harder than other big <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> stocks -- first by the market gyrations, then by Tuesday's <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> earthquake, which could leave <ORGANIZATION>B.A.T's Farmers Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> insurance unit facing big claims.
To fight off predators, B.A.T plans to spin off about $6 billion in assets, largely by selling such <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> retailing units as <ORGANIZATION>Marshall Field</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Saks</ORGANIZATION> and by floating its big paper and <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> retailing business via share issues to existing holders.
"I think the restructuring will get the required support," said <PERSON>Michael Pacitti</PERSON>, an analyst at <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> stockbroker <ORGANIZATION>UBS Phillips & Drew</ORGANIZATION>. "The shareholders effectively will support the share price by clearing the share buy-back." 
Thus <ORGANIZATION>B.A.T</ORGANIZATION>'s restructuring may only make the company a more manageable target for other corporate predators -- possibly such acquisitive bidders as <ORGANIZATION>Hanson PLC</ORGANIZATION>. 
"The last few days will surely slow down the pace of events," says Scottish Amicable's <PERSON>Mr. Gilchrist</PERSON>. "But I wouldn't write off" Sir <PERSON>James</PERSON> or other potential bidders. 
Among possible delays, the sales of <LOCATION>Saks</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Marshall Field</LOCATION> -- which were expected to be on the block soon after the crucial Christmas season -- may slide into the second quarter or second half.
People familiar with B.A.T say possible acquirers for the units include managers from both retailing chains, and <ORGANIZATION>General Cinema Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which is interested in bidding for <ORGANIZATION>Saks</ORGANIZATION>.
Other potential bidders for parts of <ORGANIZATION>B.A.T</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> retail unit include <ORGANIZATION>Dillard Department Stores Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>May Department Stores Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Limited Inc</ORGANIZATION>. B.A.T has declined to identify the potential bidders. 
Though Sir <PERSON>James</PERSON> has said he intends to mount a new bid for B.A.T once approval from <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> insurance regulators is received, jitters over prospects for junk-bond financing and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> leverage buy-outs are making investors more skeptical about Sir <PERSON>James</PERSON>'s prospects.
Market uncertainty also clouds the outlook for <ORGANIZATION>B.A.T</ORGANIZATION>'s attracting a premium price for its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> retailing properties.
Finally, Tuesday's <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> earthquake initially knocked 3.7% off <ORGANIZATION>B.A.T</ORGANIZATION>'s share price in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> yesterday because of fears of the potential claims to Los Angeles-based Farmers, which has a substantial portion of its property and casualty exposure in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. 
Through August, the top five program trading firms in volume were <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Kidder, Peabody & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
On Friday, the stock-index futures market was unhinged from the stock market when the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION> halted trading in <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor</ORGANIZATION>'s 500 futures contract -- a "circuit breaker" procedure instituted after the 1987 crash and implemented for the first time.
From a helicopter a thousand feet above <ORGANIZATION>Oakland</ORGANIZATION> after the second-deadliest earthquake in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> history, a scene of devastation emerges: a freeway crumbled into a concrete sandwich, hoses pumping water into once-fashionable apartments, abandoned autos. 
A main factor mitigating more widespread damage was the location of the quake's epicenter -- 20 miles from the heart of the <LOCATION>Silicon Valley</LOCATION> and more than 50 miles from downtown <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Oakland</ORGANIZATION>.
Like other major <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> cities, the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> -- <ORGANIZATION>Oakland</ORGANIZATION> area owes its current prosperity more to its infrastructure of fiber-optic cables linking thousands of computer terminals and telephones than to its location astride one of the world's great natural harbors. 
<PERSON>Michael L. Bandler</PERSON>, vice president for network technology at <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Bell Telephone Co.</ORGANIZATION>, says nearly all the network's computer switches, which move thousands of calls a minute from one location to another, changed to battery power when the city lost power.
One of those was in <LOCATION>Hollister</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, near the earthquake's epicenter. 
The $125-billion-a-year Bay area economy represents one-fourth of the economy of the nation's most populous state and accounts for 2% to 3% of the nation's total output of goods and services, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION>.
In high-tech, the <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area accounts for 15% to 20% of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> computer-related industry. 
"This has been a major disruption for the Bay area economy," says <PERSON>Pauline Sweezey</PERSON>, the chief economist at the <ORGANIZATION>California Department of Finance</ORGANIZATION>. "Obviously, things are going to have to go on hold for many companies." 
A quarter of a million people cross the <LOCATION>Bay Bridge</LOCATION> every day, far more than the 100,000 that use the <ORGANIZATION>Bay Area Rapid Transit</ORGANIZATION> system (BART) -- which was working but wasn't stopping in the city's Financial District yesterday afternoon because electricity was shut off and the area was being checked for gas leaks. 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> state transportation officials interviewed by telephone say they nevertheless don't expect serious problems for commerce in and out of the <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area.
All major roadways except <ORGANIZATION>Interstate 880</ORGANIZATION>, known as the <ORGANIZATION>Nimitz Freeway</ORGANIZATION>, and the <LOCATION>Bay Bridge</LOCATION> were open by 1 p.m. yesterday. 
Typical, perhaps, was the situation at <ORGANIZATION>New United Motor Manufacturing Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.-Toyota</ORGANIZATION> joint-venture auto plant in <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION>, about 35 miles south of <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>.
Computer maker <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard Co.</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION>, says one of its buildings sustained severe damage when it was knocked off its foundation.
At the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco</ORGANIZATION>, Vice President <PERSON>Robert Fienberg</PERSON> says operations were "steaming along as usual" yesterday afternoon. 
A disaster-contingency plan in which the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Fed</ORGANIZATION> would come to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s aid wasn't needed, he adds. 
<ORGANIZATION>American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>MCI Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>United Telecommunications' U S Sprint</ORGANIZATION> unit were blocking phone calls into the <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area to alleviate congestion.
<PERSON>William E. Downing</PERSON>, <PERSON>Pacific Bell</PERSON>'s vice president of customer services for the Bay area, says most long-distance companies were blocking about 50% of all calls.
<ORGANIZATION>Pacific Telesis</ORGANIZATION> says its <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Bell</ORGANIZATION> unit also was blocking about 50% of its calls locally. 
"It would in the near-term give a boost to the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> economy because there will be an influx of people to help," says <PERSON>Beth Burnham Mace</PERSON>, a regional economist at <ORGANIZATION>DRI/McGraw Hill</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Lexington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, forecasting firm. 
Adds <PERSON>Stacy Kotman</PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION>Georgia State University</ORGANIZATION>, "There's nothing positive about an earthquake, but it will probably generate more construction activity." 
In <LOCATION>Greenwich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Lone Star</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Michael London</PERSON> says, "Obviously with an earthquake of this size, there are likely to be construction projects that wouldn't otherwise have been anticipated.
"It's very difficult to model the long-term impact of this," says <PERSON>Andrew Goldberg</PERSON>, who studies the public-policy and crisis-management aspects of earthquakes at the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Strategic International Studies</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> "You certainly can say it's going to be extremely severe.
<PERSON>Jack Byrne</PERSON>, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Fireman's Fund Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION>Novato</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, estimates insured losses resulting the earthquake could total $2 billion.
<PERSON>Mr. Byrne</PERSON> says <PERSON>Fireman</PERSON>'s Fund will probably pay hundreds of millions in primary claims, but, after taxes and use of its reinsurance lines, the company's fourthquarter charge against earnings shouldn't top $50 million.
The <ORGANIZATION>Independent Insurance Agents of America</ORGANIZATION> says fewer than one of every five <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> homeowners has earthquake insurance.
The heart of the earthquake, 6.9 on the <PERSON>Richter</PERSON> scale, was 50 miles to the south, near <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>, but its terrible fist struck here on the <ORGANIZATION>Nimitz Freeway</ORGANIZATION>, a major artery serving the Bay Bridge between <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
Along the way, the quake toppled a mall in <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>, knocked down buildings in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s fashionable <LOCATION>Marina District</LOCATION> and sent a wall of bricks crashing on motorists in the city's Financial District. 
<ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION>'s earnings decline comes a year after the parent company of <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION> and the rest of the airline industry set profit records.
The <LOCATION>Fort Worth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, company is generally regarded as one of the best-run in the business, and its difficulties are likely to be reflected industrywide as other major carriers report third-quarter results over the next several days. 
Meanwhile, the company's board, which had said nothing publicly about investor <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>'s recently withdrawn $7.5 billion offer for <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION>, issued a statement condemning "ill-conceived and reckless" bids and saying it was "pleased" that <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> had backed out. 
<ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, <PERSON>Robert L. Crandall</PERSON>, said the results were due to an 11% year-to-year increase in fuel prices and a slight decrease in yield, an industry measure analogous to profit margin on each seat sold. 
<PERSON>Tim Pettee</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, said: "The business turned faster than expected.
<ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION>'s board, in a statement after a regular meeting yesterday, said: "Ill-considered and reckless acquisition proposals adversely affect employee, financial and business relationships and are contrary to the best interests of <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> shareholders. . . . <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> has not been, and is not, for sale." 
<LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> yesterday removed <PERSON>Erich Honecker</PERSON>, one of the staunchest holdouts against the reform rumbling through the Communist world, in an effort to win back the confidence of its increasingly rebellious citizens.
For the <LOCATION>Politburo</LOCATION> replaced <PERSON>Mr. Honecker</PERSON>, who had led <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> for 18 years and before that headed its security apparatus, with a man cut of the same cloth: <PERSON>Egon Krenz</PERSON>, the most recent internal-security chief and a longtime <PERSON>Honecker</PERSON> protege.
<LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>, it is clear, is no <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> now shares power with the democratically elected Solidarity union.
Still, any change in <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> has enormous implications, for both <ORGANIZATION>East</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>.
It raises the long-cherished hopes of many Germans for reunification -- a prospect that almost equally alarms political leaders in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON>, 52, was named the new party chief just minutes after the <ORGANIZATION>Party</ORGANIZATION>'s 163-member <ORGANIZATION>Central Committee</ORGANIZATION> convened in <LOCATION>East Berlin</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>ADN</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Mr. Honecker</PERSON>, a hard-line Stalinist who in 1961 supervised the construction of the <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> Wall, also was relieved of his title as head of state and his position as chief of the military.
<PERSON>Mr. Honecker</PERSON>'s ignoble fall culminates nearly two decades of iron-handed leadership during which <PERSON>Mr. Honecker</PERSON>, now 77 years old, built <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> into the most economically advanced nation in the Soviet bloc.
In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration took a characteristically cautious and skeptical view of the leadership change.
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> told reporters: "Whether that {the leadership change} reflects a change in <ORGANIZATION>East-West</ORGANIZATION> relations, I don't think so.
Because <PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON> has been very much in accord with the policies of <PERSON>Honecker</PERSON>." One top <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> expert on <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> added: "There is no clear-cut champion of reform, that we know of, in the <LOCATION>East German</LOCATION> leadership." 
According to West German government sources, <PERSON>Mr. Honecker</PERSON> and several senior <LOCATION>Politburo</LOCATION> members fought over the last week to delay any decisions about a leadership change.
Those allies included <ORGANIZATION>Politburo</ORGANIZATION> members <PERSON>Guenter Mittag</PERSON>, who has long headed economic affairs, and <PERSON>Joachim Hermann</PERSON>, chief of information policy.
<LOCATION>Born</LOCATION> in 1937 in a <LOCATION>Baltic Sea</LOCATION> town now part of <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, he was eight years old when World War II ended.
Like West German Chancellor <PERSON>Helmut Kohl</PERSON>, he represents the postwar generation that has grown up during <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s division. 
Since joining the <LOCATION>Politburo</LOCATION> in 1983 as its youngest member, <PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON> had acquired the nickname "crown prince," a reference to the widely held view that he was the hand-picked successor to <PERSON>Mr. Honecker</PERSON>.
Notably, one of <PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON>'s few official visits overseas came a few months ago, when he visited <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> after the massacre in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>.
He later defended the <LOCATION>Chinese</LOCATION> government's response during a separate visit to <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>.
His shrewd ability to read the shifting popular mood in <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> is best illustrated by his apparent break with his old mentor, <PERSON>Mr. Honecker</PERSON>.
According to a report widely circulating in <LOCATION>East Berlin</LOCATION>, it was <PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON> who ordered police to stop using excessive force against demonstrators in <LOCATION>Leipzig</LOCATION>. 
"He doesn't want to have the image of the gun man," says <PERSON>Fred Oldenburg</PERSON>, an expert at the Bonn-sponsored <ORGANIZATION>Institute of East European</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>International Studies</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cologne</LOCATION>. "He's not a reformer -- he wants to have the image of a reformer." 
Besides sacking other senior <LOCATION>Politburo</LOCATION> officials who allied themselves with <PERSON>Mr. Honecker</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON> could loosen controls on the news media, free up travel restrictions, and establish a dialogue with various dissident groups. 
Chancellor <PERSON>Kohl</PERSON>, meanwhile, has invited <PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON> to open discussions with <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> on a wide range of subjects.
Reports in the West German press, citing sources in <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>, suggest <PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON> may serve only as a bridge between <PERSON>Mr. Honecker</PERSON> and a genuine reform leader.
Adding to that speculation is <PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON>'s reputation as a heavy drinker, who is said to also suffer from diabetes. "This is a dynamic process and we're experiencing the first step," the <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> official adds.
The selection of <PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON> may also disappoint <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>.
Soviet leader <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON> has pressed hard for a change in <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>'s rigid stance.
Two reform-minded party leaders favored by <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> as possible successors to <PERSON>Mr. Honecker</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Dresden party</ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON>Hans Modrow</PERSON> and <PERSON>Politburo</PERSON> member <PERSON>Guenter Schabowski</PERSON>, were passed over.
If <PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON> sticks to rigid policies the pressure from the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> could intensify. 
In <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON> sent <PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON> a congratulatory telegram that appeared to urge the new leadership to heed growing calls for change.
According to the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION>, "<PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> expressed the conviction that the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION>Socialist Unity Party of</ORGANIZATION> {East} <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, being sensitive to the demands of the time, . . . will find solutions to complicated problems the GDR {German Democratic Republic} encountered." 
Erasing the differences still dividing <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, and the vast international reordering that implies, won't endanger the statehood of a <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> or a <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>.
Which is what the Old Guard fears. "I'm sure they'll formulate a reform that will be a recipe for the <ORGANIZATION>GDR</ORGANIZATION>'s future as a separately identifiable state," says <PERSON>Michael Simmons</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> journalist whose book on <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>, entitled "The Unloved Country," was published this month. 
Up to now, that recipe has consisted of a dogged effort by former leader <PERSON>Walter Ulbricht</PERSON> to establish the country's international legitimacy, followed by <PERSON>Mr. Honecker</PERSON>'s campaign to build the East bloc's only successful Stalinist economy into a consumer paradise.
Early in 1987, <PERSON>Mr. Honecker</PERSON> and his team stopped paying thin compliments to <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON> and joined with <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> in rejecting any necessity for adjustments in their systems.
With this year's dislocations in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, and the drive to democracy in <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>, the East German leadership grew still more defensive.
Their proclaimed purpose is to cleanse <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> of its Stalinist muck, not to merge with the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>.
Imprisoned by the Nazis during World War II for his political beliefs, <PERSON>Mr. Honecker</PERSON> typified the postwar generation of committed Communist leaders in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION> who took their cues from <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>. 
He was a "socialist warrior" who felt rankled by <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>'s enormous postwar prosperity and the <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> government's steadfast refusal to recognize the legitimacy of his state.
<PERSON>Mr. Honecker</PERSON>'s removal "was bound to happen," says one aide to Chancellor <PERSON>Kohl</PERSON>. "It was only a matter of time." 
The <ORGANIZATION>European Community Commission</ORGANIZATION> increased its forecast for economic growth in the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> in 1989 to 3.5%, slightly higher than its June projection of 3.25%. 
Slower growth countries included <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>, at 2.5%, the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION>, at 2.25%, and <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION>, at 1.75%. 
Inflation is expected to be highest in <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>, where it is projected at 14.25%, and <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, at 13%.
<ORGANIZATION>Nestle Korea Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> opened a coffee and non-dairy-creamer plant in <LOCATION>Chongju</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>.
An official at <LOCATION>Nestle Korea</LOCATION>, a 50-50 joint venture between <ORGANIZATION>Nestle S.A.</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Doosan Group</ORGANIZATION>, said the new facility will manufacture all types of soluble, roasted and ground coffee, coffee mix and nondairy coffee creamer.
Brands made by the <ORGANIZATION>Kraft General Foods</ORGANIZATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris Cos.</ORGANIZATION> had about 95% of the market share.
<ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION> currently has only about a 2% share with its <ORGANIZATION>Taster</ORGANIZATION>'s Choice coffee. 
<LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> plans to start negotiations soon on purchasing natural gas from <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION>Islamic Republic News Agency</ORGANIZATION> reported.
The agency said Polish Prime Minister <PERSON>Tadeusz Mazowiecki</PERSON> told Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON>Mahmoud Vaezi</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>'s willingess to purchase the gas during <PERSON>Mr. Vaezi</PERSON>'s current visit to <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION>.
But <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> wants to use the base for the <ORGANIZATION>People's Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION> after 1997, when the territory returns to <LOCATION>Chinese</LOCATION> sovereignty.
<PERSON>Ke Zaishuo</PERSON>, head of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s delegation to a <ORGANIZATION>Chinese-British Liaison Committee</ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>, accused <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> of trying to impose a fait accompli and said, "This is something we cannot accept." 
The <LOCATION>Israeli</LOCATION> and Soviet national airlines have reached preliminary agreement for launching the first direct flights between <LOCATION>Tel Aviv</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, a spokesman for the Israeli airline, <ORGANIZATION>El Al</ORGANIZATION>, said.
<ORGANIZATION>El Al</ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON>Rafi Har-Lev</PERSON> and top officials of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>'s Aeroflot negotiated a preliminary pact in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> this week, the spokesman said.
The chairman and a director of one of the <ORGANIZATION>Republic of Singapore</ORGANIZATION>'s leading property companies, <ORGANIZATION>City Development Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, or CDL, were charged yesterday with criminal breach of trust of some 800,000 <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> dollars (about US$409,000). 
<PERSON>Kwek Hong Png</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>CDL</ORGANIZATION>, and director <PERSON>Quek Leng Chye</PERSON> were arrested by the republic's Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau Tuesday night.
The charges are the culmination of weeks of rumors concerning <ORGANIZATION>CDL</ORGANIZATION> that have depressed the company's share price and to a lesser extent the shares of all companies owned by <ORGANIZATION>CDL</ORGANIZATION>'s controlling <PERSON>Quek</PERSON> family, brokers in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> say.
The Queks control the <ORGANIZATION>Hong Leong Group</ORGANIZATION>, which has widespread interests in manufacturing, property and finance in both <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>. 
News of the arrest and charging of the two men helped to push prices on the <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> Stock market sharply lower in early trading yesterday, but brokers said that the market and <ORGANIZATION>CDL</ORGANIZATION> shares recovered once it became apparent the charges were limited to the two men personally. 
British Tissues decided to do away with its hard paper after a major customer, <ORGANIZATION>British Rail</ORGANIZATION>, switched to softer tissues for train bathrooms. . . . Peasants in <LOCATION>Inner Mongolia</LOCATION> have partly dismantled a 20-mile section of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s famed Great Wall, the official <ORGANIZATION>People's Daily</ORGANIZATION> said.
The Wall Street Journal "American Way of Buying" Survey consists of two separate, door-to-door nationwide polls conducted for the <ORGANIZATION>Journal</ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION>Peter D. Hart Research Associates</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Roper Organization</ORGANIZATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION> said it fined <ORGANIZATION>Capcom Futures Inc.</ORGANIZATION> $500,000 and accepted its withdrawal from membership as part of a settlement of disciplinary actions against the firm. 
<ORGANIZATION>Capcom Futures</ORGANIZATION> is a <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Capcom Financial Services Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> financial firm that was implicated last year in a scheme to launder drug money.
The firm was indicted in <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, on money-laundering charges. 
In June, the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Board of Trade</ORGANIZATION> said it suspended <ORGANIZATION>Capcom Financial</ORGANIZATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Capcom Futures</ORGANIZATION> unit withdrew from <ORGANIZATION>Board of Trade</ORGANIZATION> membership voluntarily in August, a <ORGANIZATION>Board of Trade</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. 
Capcom Futures, while neither admitting nor denying the <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> charges, said in a statement that the <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> charges were "technical in nature" and that "no customers were hurt" as a result of the violations cited by the <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> alleged that, among other things, from April 1987 through October 1988 Capcom Futures failed to document trades between <ORGANIZATION>Capcom Futures</ORGANIZATION> and people or entities directly or indirectly controlled by <ORGANIZATION>Capcom Futures</ORGANIZATION> shareholders. 
They are telling people what roads are closed and just keeping the public informed has helped to keep the panic down," said <PERSON>James Ball</PERSON>, a station supervisor at <ORGANIZATION>Daly City Police Department</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Kim Schwartz</PERSON>, a spokesperson for the <ORGANIZATION>American Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, said television and radio stations in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> played a "very positive role" by providing the address of 28 shelters of the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> and by giving out the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> number for contributions to help earthquake victims (1-800-453-9000). 
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> signed a disaster declaration covering seven Northern <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> counties.
The <ORGANIZATION>Department of Housing and Urban Development</ORGANIZATION> prepared to make as many as 100 vacant houses available for those left homeless, the <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> was set to divert food from the school-lunch program to earthquake victims, and the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> was providing everything from radio communications to blood transfusions to military police for directing traffic. 
In <LOCATION>Hugo</LOCATION>'s wake, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> allocated $1.1 billion in relief funds, and <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON> said $273 million of that money remains and could be diverted for quick expenditures related to the earthquake. 
<ORGANIZATION>FEMA</ORGANIZATION> still has special disaster centers open to handle the aftermath of <LOCATION>Hugo</LOCATION>, and spokesman <PERSON>Russell Clanahan</PERSON> acknowledged that "we're pretty thin." <PERSON>Mr. Clanahan</PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION>FEMA</ORGANIZATION> now possibly may have the heaviest caseload in its history. 
To further complicate relief efforts, the privately funded <ORGANIZATION>American Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> also finds itself strapped for funds after its big Hugo operation. "It's been a bad month money-wise and every other way," said <PERSON>Sally Stewart</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION>. "It just makes it a little rough when you have to worry about the budget." The <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> has opened 30 shelters in the <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area, serving 5,000 people.
All the precise types of federal aid that will be sent to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> won't be determined until state officials make specific requests to <ORGANIZATION>FEMA</ORGANIZATION>, agency officials said.
And in the confusion after the earthquake, "the information flow is a little slow coming in from the affected area," said <PERSON>Carl Suchocki</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>FEMA</ORGANIZATION> spokesman. 
<ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> officials said they will make available as many as 100 Bay area houses that are under <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> loans but now are vacant after the houses have been inspected to ensure they are sound.
And the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> said residents of the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> area will be able to cash in savings bonds even if they haven't held them for the minimum six-month period. 
Even before the full extent of the devastation was known, <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Dick Cheney</PERSON> ordered the military services to set up an emergency command center in the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> and prepare to respond to various <ORGANIZATION>FEMA</ORGANIZATION> requests for assistance. 
By yesterday afternoon, <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> transport planes began moving additional rescue and medical supplies, physicians, communications equipment and <ORGANIZATION>FEMA</ORGANIZATION> personnel to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
Two <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> facilities near <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Travis Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION>, 50 miles northeast of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, were designated to serve as medical-airlift centers.
Some victims also were treated at the <ORGANIZATION>Letterman Army Medical Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and at the <LOCATION>Naval Hospital</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>.
In addition, 20 military police from the <LOCATION>Presidio</LOCATION>, a military base in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, are assisting with traffic control, and a <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> ship was moved from a naval station at <ORGANIZATION>Treasure Island</ORGANIZATION> near the <LOCATION>Bay Bridge</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> to help fight fires. 
To help residents in <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION> rebuild, <ORGANIZATION>FEMA</ORGANIZATION> intends to set up 17 disaster assistance offices in the earthquake area in the next several days and to staff them with 400 to 500 workers from various agencies, said <PERSON>Robert Volland</PERSON>, chief of the agency's individual assistance division.
And though federal law dictates that only $100 million can be disbursed from that fund in any one state per disaster, administration officials expect <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to move in to authorize spending more now in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Keith Mulrooney</PERSON>, special assistant to Federal Highway Administrator <PERSON>Thomas Larson</PERSON>, also said that after the 1971 <LOCATION>San Fernando</LOCATION> earthquake in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, the state set tougher standards for bridges, and with federal aid, began a program to retrofit highways and bridges for earthquake hazards.
The provisions, in deficit-reduction bills recently passed by the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, could further cool the takeover boom that has been the driving force behind the bull market in stocks for much of the 1980s, some tax experts and investment bankers argue.
"You see these in just about every LBO," said <PERSON>Robert Willens</PERSON>, senior vice president in charge of tax issues at <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. "It becomes a source of cash" for the company making the <ORGANIZATION>LBO</ORGANIZATION> because it gets a deduction and doesn't have to repay the debt for several years. 
These types of bonds have been used in buy-outs of companies such as <ORGANIZATION>RJR Nabisco Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Storer Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Kroger Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
A second provision passed by the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> would eliminate a rule allowing companies that post losses resulting from <ORGANIZATION>LBO</ORGANIZATION> debt to receive refunds of taxes paid over the previous three years.
But that rule is being virtually overlooked by Wall Street, which is concentrating on coping with the deduction issue. "Prices for LBOs have to come down if you don't have that feature," argued <PERSON>Lawrence Schloss</PERSON>, managing director for merchant banking at <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
An investment group led by <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Pritzker</PERSON> family recently lowered a $3.35 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION>American Medical International</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, because of the threat of the legislation. 
That would force the buy-out firm and the target company's management to reduce their level of ownership. "The pigs in the trough may have to give a little bit of the slop back and then the deal can go through," said <PERSON>Peter C. Canellos</PERSON>, tax partner at <ORGANIZATION>Wachtell</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Lipton</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Rosen & Katz</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> version of the bill would make debt non-deductible if it pays five percentage points above <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> notes, has at least a five-year maturity and doesn't pay interest for at least one year out of the first five.
<ORGANIZATION>NEWHALL LAND & FARMING Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Valencia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, announced a 2-for-1 split in the real estate limited partnership's units and increased its regular quarterly cash distribution 33%, to 40 cents a unit.
<ORGANIZATION>Maxus Energy Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, said it discovered a new oil field northeast of its previously discovered <LOCATION>Intan Field</LOCATION> in the southeast <LOCATION>Sumatra</LOCATION> area of <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Maxus</PERSON> said it didn't run a production test on the three discovery wells it drilled in the field, which is about 1.6 miles from the <LOCATION>Intan Field</LOCATION>, because the wells are similar to others drilled at its <ORGANIZATION>Intan</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Widuri</LOCATION> fields. 
The <LOCATION>Intan Field</LOCATION> has estimated reserves of 50 million barrels and the <LOCATION>Widuri Field</LOCATION> has estimated reserves of 225 million barrels. 
Other interests are owned by <ORGANIZATION>BP Petroleum Development</ORGANIZATION> (SES) <LOCATION>Ltd.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>C. Itoh Energy Co</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>Ltd.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Deminex Sumatra</PERSON> OEL G.m.b.
H., Hispanoil (<ORGANIZATION>Sumatra</ORGANIZATION>) <ORGANIZATION>Production Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, Hudbay Oil (<LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>) <LOCATION>Ltd.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Inpex Sumatra Co</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Lasmo Sumatra Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Sunda Shell</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>TCR Sumat A.G.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Warrior Oil Co</ORGANIZATION>.
The production-sharing contract area is held with <LOCATION>Pertamina</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Indonesian</LOCATION> state oil company. 
<PERSON>Bear Stearns</PERSON>'s chief economist, <PERSON>Lawrence Kudlow</PERSON>, in the Sept. 29 issue of the firm's Global Spectator: 
<ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it reduced its rating on $281 million of senior and subordinated debt of this thrift holding company, to C from Ca, saying it believes bondholders will recover only "negligible principal." The agency said it confirmed <ORGANIZATION>American Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s preferred stock rating at <ORGANIZATION>C. American Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s thrift unit, Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln Savings & Loan Association</ORGANIZATION>, is in receivership and the parent company has filed for protection from creditor lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. 
CENTRUST SAVINGS BANK (<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>) -- <ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION> downgraded its ratings on the subordinated debt of <ORGANIZATION>CenTrust</ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION>Caa</LOCATION> from B-3.
The downgrades were prompted, <ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION>'s said, by the continuing turmoil in the junk bond market and the suspension of dividends on <ORGANIZATION>CenTrust</ORGANIZATION>'s preferred stock.
<ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION>'s also said it believed the proposed sale of 63 CenTrust branches to <ORGANIZATION>Great Western Bank</ORGANIZATION> could, if completed, endanger the thrift's funding and market position. 
Ambassador <PERSON>Paul Nitze</PERSON>'s statement (<ORGANIZATION>Notable & Quotable</ORGANIZATION>, Sept. 20), "If you have a million people working for you, every bad thing that has one chance in a million of going wrong will go wrong at least once a year," is a pretty negative way of looking at things. 
Liquidating the <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, thrift will drain the federal deposit insurance fund by more than $2.5 billion, making it the largest thrift failure in history.
Back in June, we recounted how five <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Senators -- <PERSON>Alan Cranston</PERSON> of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Dennis DeConcini</PERSON> and <PERSON>John McCain</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <PERSON>John Glenn</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Donald Riegle</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> -- intervened with regulators to ease up on <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION>, whose risk-fraught loans were more worthy of a casino than a federally insured thrift. 
Last Friday, <ORGANIZATION>Common Cause</ORGANIZATION>, a political-reform lobby, asked for a <ORGANIZATION>Senate Ethics Committee</ORGANIZATION> probe of the five Senators.
<ORGANIZATION>Perhaps Common Cause</ORGANIZATION> has come to recognize that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> is generally incapable of investigating itself. 
<PERSON>Charles Keating Jr.</PERSON>, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION>American Continental</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln</ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, needed the Senators' help in his running battle with federal regulators.
He admits he made large contributions to each of them so they would "take up my cause." In one case, 57 <ORGANIZATION>Keating</ORGANIZATION> executives gave $66,100 to Senator <PERSON>Riegle</PERSON> at the same March 1987 fund-raiser.
In April 1987, the Senators,, absent <PERSON>Mr. Riegle</PERSON>, asked to meet with <PERSON>Ed Gray</PERSON>, then head of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Home Loan Bank Board</ORGANIZATION>, and according to <PERSON>Mr. Gray</PERSON>, unsuccessfully pressed him to drop a key regulation detrimental to <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> -- "a clear subversion of the regulatory process." Senator <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> now calls the meeting "improper" and after several previous denials, Senator <PERSON>Cranston</PERSON> now admits the regulation probably came up.
Days later, the four senators -- joined by <PERSON>Mr. Riegle</PERSON> -- met with other regulators to press <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s case. 
Senators <PERSON>Glenn</PERSON>, <PERSON>Riegle</PERSON> and <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> apparently stopped doing favors for <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> after that, but Senators <PERSON>Cranston</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>DeConcini</ORGANIZATION> persisted, intervening on behalf of <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION> until just before its closure this year. 
-- The <LOCATION>Arizona Republic</LOCATION> reports that two of Senator <PERSON>DeConcini</PERSON>'s top aides received more than $50 million in real-estate loans from <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION>. 
-- Senator <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> recently reimbursed <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> for $13,400 in previously unreported airplane trips, and revealed that his wife and father-in-law invested $359,100 in a Keating shopping-center partnership in 1986. 
-- Senator <PERSON>Cranston</PERSON> solicited $850,000 in contributions from <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> for three "nonpartisan" voter-registration groups, which some former employees now say were fronts for the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>. 
-- Senator <PERSON>Glenn</PERSON> solicited $200,000 in contributions from <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> for a political committee he controlled that paid him to travel around the country.
By contrast, the extensively covered <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> political scandals may cost the taxpayers $2.0 billion, the centerpiece being a $0.0003 billion check to <PERSON>James Watt</PERSON>, the legality of which seems to be uncontested. 
This is not a matter of whispering "bunny." The 160-page civil suit filed against <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> last month by the <ORGANIZATION>Resolution Trust Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the vehicle for the S&L bailout, traces a clear thread.
The <ORGANIZATION>House Banking Committee</ORGANIZATION> has voted to subpoena <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> and top federal regulators to testify about <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>.
The hearings begin tomorrow, and will focus on why thrift regulator <PERSON>M. Danny Wall</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> staffer, overruled staff recommendations to close <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> and transferred regulatory oversight of <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
It was Common Cause's demand last year for a <ORGANIZATION>House Ethics Committee</ORGANIZATION> probe of <PERSON>Speaker Jim Wright</PERSON> that prompted the committee to hire <PERSON>Richard Phelan</PERSON> as an outside counsel.
<PERSON>Mr. Phelan</PERSON> found that <PERSON>Mr. Wright</PERSON> had improperly intervened with federal regulators on behalf of S&Ls, but the <ORGANIZATION>Ethics Committee</ORGANIZATION> disagreed, saying such actions were an integral part of a Member's job and it could not second-guess "the technique and personality of the legislator." If the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Ethics Committee</ORGANIZATION> chooses to investigate, it will be interesting to see if it reaches the same conclusion in the case of the five Senators. 
<ORGANIZATION>BMA Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>, said it's weighing "strategic alternatives," for its <ORGANIZATION>Business Men's Assurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> unit, and is contacting possible buyers of the life and health insurance operation. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON>Carla Hills</PERSON> said the first dispute-settlement panel set up under the U.S.-Canadian "free trade" agreement has ruled that <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s restrictions on exports of <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> salmon and herring violate the accord. 
<PERSON>Mrs. Hills</PERSON> said the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> have until Nov. 13 to resolve the dispute.
If a solution isn't reached by then, she said, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> would have the right to suspend some trade concessions to <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> equivalent in value to the losses suffered by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> fish-processing companies in <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Pacific Northwest</LOCATION>. 
However, in <LOCATION>Ottawa</LOCATION>, Canadian Trade Minister <PERSON>John Crosbie</PERSON> said the dispute-settlement panel accepted the "legitimacy of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s position on the use of these landing requirements to conserve and manage these important fisheries." 
Questioned about the seeming contradiction in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canadian</LOCATION> government views of the panel's report, an aide for <PERSON>Mrs. Hills</PERSON> said the panel had clearly ruled that the Canadian trade restrictions "are illegal." 
<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> initially had an export prohibition that was replaced by regulations requiring that such fish had to be brought ashore in <LOCATION>British Columbia</LOCATION> by commercial fishermen prior to export.
<PERSON>Mrs. Hills</PERSON> said yesterday that the dispute-settlement panel rejected this <LOCATION>Canadian</LOCATION> government argument. "We fully expect that <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> will comply with the panel's ruling" that the "landing requirement" also must be ended, she said. 
Earlier, an international panel set up under the rules of the <ORGANIZATION>General Agreement on Tariffs</ORGANIZATION> and Trade in <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> determined that the original Canadian fish-export restrictions violated <ORGANIZATION>GATT</ORGANIZATION> rules. 
<PERSON>Mrs. Hills</PERSON> said the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> won't accept any delays after Nov. 13 because <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> fish-processing firms enter into contracts in the fall to purchase the next season's catch.
Blue Arrow Chairman <PERSON>Mitchell Fromstein</PERSON> said in an interview that the two steps may be a prelude to reincorporating the world's biggest employment-services group in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <PERSON>Mr. Fromstein</PERSON> disclosed the planned steps, expected within a few months, as <ORGANIZATION>Blue Arrow</ORGANIZATION> posted a 2.5% drop in its third-quarter pretax earnings. 
The name change and good will write-off could help solidify Blue Arrow's dominance of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> temporary-help market and give it a more American image as <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> investors turn jittery about foreign stocks after Friday's market plunge.
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> holders now own more than 60% of Blue Arrow compared with 9% last January. "In the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market, the recognition of the Manpower name is infinitely stronger than Blue Arrow," <PERSON>Mr. Fromstein</PERSON> said. 
The moves also could erase shareholders' perception of <ORGANIZATION>Blue Arrow</ORGANIZATION> as a company in turmoil. "It further reinforces the concept that Blue Arrow is a thing of the past," said <PERSON>Doug Arthur</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Kidder Peabody & Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
In a widely publicized boardroom coup, <PERSON>Mr. Fromstein</PERSON> ousted <PERSON>Antony Berry</PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION>Blue Arrow</ORGANIZATION> chief executive in January, a month after <PERSON>Mr. Berry</PERSON> had forced <PERSON>Mr. Fromstein</PERSON> out as the $1 million-a-year chief of Milwaukee-based Manpower.
<PERSON>Mr. Fromstein</PERSON> solidified his control in April by taking over from <PERSON>Mr. Berry</PERSON> as chairman. 
But the Blue Arrow tumult isn't over yet, as the British government is investigating a disputed #25 million ($39.4 million) loan which <PERSON>Mr. Fromstein</PERSON> has said was made under <PERSON>Mr. Berry</PERSON>'s direction. 
But with so many shares now held in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Blue Arrow</ORGANIZATION> reports its earnings two ways, based on both <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> accounting standards. "Our balance sheets look like they came from <LOCATION>Alice</LOCATION>'s wonderland," <PERSON>Mr. Fromstein</PERSON> said.
The <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> version shows "a handful of pounds of net worth" following the 1987 write-off of good will, while the <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> version reflects "$1 billion of net worth because almost none of {the good will} has been written off." 
<PERSON>Mr. Fromstein</PERSON> said he hopes to eradicate some of the good will left on <ORGANIZATION>Blue Arrow</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> books in one fell swoop, but wouldn't specify how much.
The number of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> temporary workers fell about 1% in the 12 months ending Aug. 31, after sliding nearly 3.5% in July, said <ORGANIZATION>Kidder Peabody</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Arthur</PERSON>. 
By 10 a.m. <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> time, the index was up 435.11 points, to 34903.80 as investors hailed <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s overnight rally. 
Shares also closed sharply lower across <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, particularly in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, although <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and a few other markets recovered some ground after stocks began to rebound in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
Other Asian and <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> markets had sharper losses than <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, but the selling wave stopped short of precipitating another market crash. 
"We didn't trade much today, as our policy now is to wait and see," said a fund manager at <ORGANIZATION>Taisho Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> "We would like to wait and see until trading goes around through <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>." 
On Oct. 16, 1987 -- the Friday before the Black Monday crash -- the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> market dropped 4.6%, and <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> followed on Monday with a 2.4% drop.
Two years ago, <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s biggest fall came the day after <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s 22.6% Black Monday plunge, when the <ORGANIZATION>Nikkei</ORGANIZATION> average fell 14.9%.
<PERSON>Nobuto Yasuda</PERSON>, a director at <ORGANIZATION>Yamaichi Investment Trust & Management Co.</ORGANIZATION>, called yesterday's session "a good scenario" for <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. "Now we are looking for the time to place buy orders," he said. "For us institutional investors, the chance for buying has come." 
<PERSON>Isao Ushikubo</PERSON>, general manager of the investment research department at <ORGANIZATION>Toyo Trust & Banking Co.</ORGANIZATION>, also was optimistic.
Other fund managers were similarly sanguine. "We have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities," said <PERSON>Masato Murakami</PERSON>, chief portfolio manager in the pension fund management department at <ORGANIZATION>Yasuda Trust & Banking Co</ORGANIZATION>.
Among other <LOCATION>Asian</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> markets, <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> had the biggest losses, with the <LOCATION>Kuala Lumpur</LOCATION> composite index in <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> falling 11.5% and <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Straits Times Industrial Index</ORGANIZATION> down 10%.
Major indexes declined more than 8% in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> and 6.5% in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Bangkok</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Jakarta</LOCATION> escaped with slightly smaller losses. 
"It's pure psychology," said <PERSON>William Au Yeung</PERSON>, an account executive for <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>HK</LOCATION>) Ltd. in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>. "Markets in this region aren't so geared to leveraged buy-outs, and their economies generally are in good shape, but there's no doubt that <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> is still following <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s lead." 
Several analysts said <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> had the biggest losses because they are relatively open to rapid cash flows.
<LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> is the region's next most open market, but many foreign investors have been staying away from it since it plunged in June amid political turmoil in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. 
"<LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> took the hit because when people want to get out, they tend to go where the liquidity is," said <PERSON>Elizabeth Hambrecht</PERSON>, a regional analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Baring Securities</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>) <LOCATION>Ltd</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Richard Chenevix-Trench</PERSON>, a director at <LOCATION>Hong</LOCATION> Kong-based <ORGANIZATION>Baring International Fund Managers Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, said the market probably hasn't hit bottom yet but is close. "If <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> doesn't collapse, I see maybe another 5% on the downside, not counting the risk of bad news out of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>," he said. 
In <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>'s All Ordinaries index closed at 1601.5, down 8.1%, its biggest drop since October 1987.
<PERSON>Nestor Hinzack</PERSON>, an analyst at brokerage firm <ORGANIZATION>Burdett, Buckeridge & Young Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, described the market's performance as "sheep-like" as investors fled to bluechip Australian stocks and shunned entrepreneurial companies they perceived as having any takeover premium built into the price. 
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Financial Times-Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> 100-share index, the most closely watched market barometer, ended at its intraday high of 2163.4, down 70.5, or 3.2%.
Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Laidlaw Transportation Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> said it raised its stake in <ORGANIZATION>ADT Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Bermuda</LOCATION> to 29.4% from 28%. 
A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Laidlaw</ORGANIZATION> declined to disclose the price the <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> transportation and waste services concern paid for the additional shares, which he said were acquired "over the last couple of weeks." 
The spokesman said <ORGANIZATION>Laidlaw</ORGANIZATION> wouldn't increase its stake in <ORGANIZATION>ADT</ORGANIZATION> beyond 30% "without a great deal of thought" because of <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> takeover regulations that require a company acquiring more than 30% to extend an offer to the rest of the company's shareholders.
<ORGANIZATION>ADT</ORGANIZATION>, a security services and auctions company, trades on <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 
<LOCATION>Laidlaw</LOCATION> is 47%-controlled by <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Pacific Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> transportation, resources and industrial holding concern. 
Share prices plummeted across <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> yesterday in response to Friday's <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> sell-off, but some issues staged a late comeback after Wall Street opened without another rout. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Frankfurt Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, which closed before the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> exchanges opened, was the hardest hit of the major <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> markets, with the DAX Index dropping 12.8%. 
In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, prices plummeted in early trading and were off as much as 9% before coming back strong after the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> opening to close down only 3.2%. 
The economy of <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> {<ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>} is highly stable." 
Share prices fell in <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>.
Investors may have reacted so strongly to Friday's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stock market loss because they had vivid memories of the <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> exchange's losing 35% of its value in the 1987 crash and its wake. 
This time, however, many small investors may have been hurt by acting so swiftly. "They all went in the wrong direction," said <PERSON>Andreas Insam</PERSON>, an investment adviser for the <ORGANIZATION>Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Liechtenstein</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> branch.
After the opening was delayed 30 minutes because of the crush of sell orders, <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>'s normal two-hour trading session was extended 75 minutes to handle the heavy volume. "The beginning was chaotic," said <PERSON>Nigel Longley</PERSON>, a broker for <ORGANIZATION>Commerzbank AG</ORGANIZATION>. "It took three-quarters of an hour before enough prices could be worked out to get a reading on the market." 
That is why everybody was a little surprised by the storm of sell orders from small private investors," said <PERSON>Norbert Braeuer</PERSON>, a senior trader for <ORGANIZATION>Hessische Landesbank</ORGANIZATION>. 
But even if Wall Street continues to stabilize, analysts here say the latest blow to investor confidence could inhibit a swift recovery for the <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> exchange, which already was showing signs of weakness after the <ORGANIZATION>DAX</ORGANIZATION> had slipped from a 1989 high of 1657.61 on Sept. 8. 
A 16.3% drop for <ORGANIZATION>Mannesmann AG</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Dresdner Bank AG</ORGANIZATION>'s 9.6% decline were especially problematic for their respective boards, whose plans for major rights issues in November could now be in jeopardy. 
<LOCATION>LONDON</LOCATION>: Headed toward a record drop at midday, the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> stock market recouped two-thirds of its losses in the wake of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s early rally. 
It was big institutions such as <ORGANIZATION>Norwich Union Insurance Group</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Scottish Amicable Investment Managers and Standard Life Assurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> that spearheaded the rally.
<LOCATION>PARIS</LOCATION>: Late buying gave the <LOCATION>Paris Bourse</LOCATION> a parachute after its free fall early in the day.
"There was a volatility in the market that I have never seen before," said <PERSON>Michel Vigier</PERSON>, a partner in brokerage firm <ORGANIZATION>Cholet Dupont</ORGANIZATION>. "When Wall Street turned around shortly after the opening, there was panic buying in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>." 
In a possible prelude to the resumption of talks between <ORGANIZATION>Boeing Co.</ORGANIZATION> and striking <ORGANIZATION>Machinists</ORGANIZATION> union members, a federal mediator said representatives of the two sides will meet with him tomorrow. 
"It could be a long meeting or it could be a short one," said <PERSON>Doug Hammond</PERSON>, the mediator, who called the agreement to meet a first step toward a resumption of negotiations. "We're encouraged that talks are scheduled again but beyond that, we have made no expression of expectations," a <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. 
And at the company's <LOCATION>Wichita</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kan.</LOCATION>, plant, about 2,400 of the 11,700 machinists still are working, <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> said.
<ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> has declined to say how many employees are working at its giant <LOCATION>Renton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, plant. 
The team that dumped runs by the bushel on the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Cubs</ORGANIZATION> in the National League playoffs was held to just one in two games by the home-team <ORGANIZATION>Oakland A</ORGANIZATION>'s, the gang that had been done unto similarly by the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Dodgers</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Orel Hershiser</PERSON> in last year's tournament.
<PERSON>Mark McGwire</PERSON>, the big, red-haired <ORGANIZATION>Oakland</ORGANIZATION> first baseman, had three hits in four at bats, two more than he'd had in the five-game Dodger series in which he'd gone 1-for-17.
Right-hander <PERSON>Dave Stewart</PERSON> held the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> to five hits to account for the zero on the other side of the Saturday ledger.
The same goes for <PERSON>Mike Moore</PERSON>, another veteran who overcame early struggles to permit the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> but a run and four hits in seven innings in Sunday's contest. 
"Every guy they put out there had a better split-finger than the guy before," marveled <ORGANIZATION>Giant</ORGANIZATION> manager <PERSON>Roger Craig</PERSON>.
The only thing I'm rooting for is for the Series to go seven games," said <PERSON>David Williams</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> septuagenarian, at the Coliseum before Sunday's go. 
Suffice it to say that if this were a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Yankees-Mets series, or one between the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Cubs</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>White Sox</ORGANIZATION> (hey, it's possible), you'd need uniformed police in every other seat to separate opposing fans, and only the suicidal would bifurcate their bonnets. 
In the opening game, besides <PERSON>Steinbach</PERSON> and <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON>, there was <PERSON>Walt Weiss</PERSON>, a twiggy-looking, second-year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery.
The cold guys in the set were <PERSON>Will Clark</PERSON>, <PERSON>Kevin Mitchell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Matt Williams</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>' 3-4-5 hitters.
It's that last set of numbers, as much as anything else, that gives the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> hope in the Series games to come. "I believe in the law of averages," declared <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> batting coach <ORGANIZATION>Dusty Baker</ORGANIZATION> after game two. "I'd rather see a so-so hitter who's hot come up for the other side than a good hitter who's cold." 
The <LOCATION>Little Rock</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>, hazardous-waste services company said the restatement will reduce its net for the nine months ended July 31 to $2.5 million, or 17 cents a share, from $3.7 million, or 26 cents a share.
<PERSON>Jack W. Forrest</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Systems</ORGANIZATION> president and chief executive officer, said the change increases the company's effective tax rate to about 35% from 20%. 
A troubling sign: Declining stocks on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> outnumbered advancers, 975 to 749, and the over-the-counter market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of Friday's late <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> plunge.
Transports plunged on takeover disappointments in two airline stocks, <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION>, which each fell more than 20% when they reopened for trading yesterday after being suspended Friday afternoon.
Overall, "this is a pleasant rally but it's very selective," said <PERSON>Arthur Cashin Jr.</PERSON>, a veteran <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION> trader at the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>. "Everyone was a little concerned about the general narrowness of the rally and failure of the OTC market to get into plus territory.
The rally gave credence, at least for now, to the pre-trading declaration of <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>John J. Phelan Jr.</PERSON> that Friday's market debacle was "an abnormal condition, and not a disaster." 
But most of the 30 blue-chip stocks in the average, including <PERSON>Eastman Kodak</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION>, couldn't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell orders left over from Friday's late-afternoon rout.
<PERSON>Roland M. Machold</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey Division of Investment</ORGANIZATION>, which oversees $29 billion in investments, said the "first thing we did was to double our orders" yesterday morning. "With the market down like this, we'll probably take another $50 million and put it in" the market. 
According to <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> officials, <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> had one of the biggest sell-order imbalances on Friday; it was one of the seven stocks that couldn't finish trading that day.
However, <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> specialist <PERSON>Robert Fagenson</PERSON> said: "I would be surprised if Goldman represented 4% of the opening volume." 
At <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, head equity trader <PERSON>Dudley Eppel</PERSON> said: "I think the opening was constructive.
Grinned <PERSON>Griffith Peck</PERSON>, a trader in <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>OTC</ORGANIZATION> department: "I tell you, this market acts healthy." Around him, scores of traders seemed to get a burst of energy; their boss broke out bottles of Perrier water to cool them off. 
The carnage on the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Board Options Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, the nation's major options market, was heavy after the trading in <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 100 stock-index options was halted Friday.
<PERSON>James Gallagher</PERSON>, a partner at specialist <ORGANIZATION>Fowler & Rosenau</ORGANIZATION>, said, "The difference between today and two years ago" -- "Terrible Tuesday," Oct. 20, 1987 -- "is that then we needed a savior to go into the Major Market Index, spend $2 million and get the program rally started.
However, according to one analyst, the timing of Major Market Index futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of Terrible Tuesday. "Futures were pulling the stock market higher," said <PERSON>Donald Selkin</PERSON>, head of stock-index futures research at <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
But yesterday, even with halts in such major blue-chip stocks as <PERSON>Merck</PERSON>, "we expected (the halts) and it wasn't too bad," said <PERSON>Donaldson</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Mr. Eppel</PERSON>, who had been critical of the specialists' performance on Friday.
According to a <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> official, while many stocks opened late, there were subsequent trading halts in only three issues -- <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Merck</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Valero Energy</ORGANIZATION>.
For example, <PERSON>Halliburton</PERSON> jumped 3 1/4 to 38, <PERSON>Schlumberger</PERSON> rose 2 1/2 to 43 1/4 and <ORGANIZATION>Baker Hughes</ORGANIZATION> rose 1 1/8 to 22. 
Because of the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> tumbles, airlines were the weakest sector of the market yesterday. 
<PERSON>Philip Morris</PERSON> was the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s most active issue, rising 2 1/4 to 43 1/4 on nearly eight million shares. 
Among other major issues, <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola Co.</ORGANIZATION> closed up 2 at 66 3/4 on 1.7 million shares and <ORGANIZATION>American Telephone & Telegraph</ORGANIZATION> rose 3 1/4 to 43 on nearly 7.8 million shares.
<ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION> added 1 3/4 to 28, <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION> rose 3/4 to 18 1/2 and <ORGANIZATION>Bear Stearns</ORGANIZATION> rose 3/8 to 14 1/4. 
At a news conference after the close of trading yesterday, the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Phelan</PERSON> and other exchange officials praised the performance of their computers and personnel. 
Meanwhile, <PERSON>Peter DaPuzzo</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>'s head of retail equity trading, praised institutional investors in the OTC market, who were heavy buyers of the <ORGANIZATION>Nasdaq</ORGANIZATION>'s biggest technology issues yesterday amid a flood of selling by other investors. "The institutions can't be criticized for their behavior," <PERSON>Mr. DaPuzzo</PERSON> said in an interview. "It was the opposite of what happened on Oct. 19.
<PERSON>Mr. Phelan</PERSON> said the performance of specialists during Friday's plunge was admirable, because out of 1,640 <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> common stocks traded during the day only seven were closed and weren't reopened before the close. "They did an excellent job," <PERSON>Mr. Phelan</PERSON> said of the specialists.
<PERSON>James A. White</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sonja Steptoe</PERSON> contributed to this article. 
Shortly after completing the $1.56 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>West Point-Pepperell Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in April, <PERSON>Mr. Farley</PERSON>'s holding company, <ORGANIZATION>Farley Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said it was considering the sale of <PERSON>Cluett</PERSON>, a leading shirt maker and one of <ORGANIZATION>West Point-Pepperell</ORGANIZATION>'s biggest units. 
<PERSON>Mr. Farley</PERSON> said the sale of three of <PERSON>Cluett</PERSON>'s four main divisions plus other "anticipated" West Point-Pepperell asset sales by December, should bring in a total of about $700 million.
<PERSON>Mr. Farley</PERSON> followed a similar pattern when he acquired <ORGANIZATION>Northwest Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and then sold much of its assets.
<PERSON>Cluett</PERSON> was an independent company until <ORGANIZATION>West Point-Pepperell</ORGANIZATION> acquired it for $375 million in cash and stock in 1986.
<ORGANIZATION>Bidermann</ORGANIZATION> sells clothes under various labels, including Yves Saint Laurent and <PERSON>Bill Robinson</PERSON> for men and <PERSON>Ralph Lauren</PERSON> for women.
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>West Point-Pepperell</ORGANIZATION> fell 25 cents to $53.875. 
<ORGANIZATION>LIN Broadcasting Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it won't take a position on a revised tender offer by <ORGANIZATION>McCaw Cellular Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION> to buy <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> and has asked for clarification of the offer. 
<ORGANIZATION>McCaw</ORGANIZATION>'s revised tender offer would require McCaw to begin an auction process in July 1994 that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> is asking McCaw to clarify its tender offer, which challenges an agreement between <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> to merge their cellular-telephone businesses.
<ORGANIZATION>BellSouth</ORGANIZATION> has notified <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> that it would "shortly respond to the McCaw proposal in as full and effective a manner as is warranted." 
The <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> board said holders may be misled by the provision in the <PERSON>McCaw</PERSON> proposal that "guarantees" private market value after five years for the remaining shares.
The board added that McCaw would be able to control <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION>'s operations and could, "therefore, operate <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> in a manner which could diminish its private market value and attractiveness to a third-party purchaser in five years." 
<ORGANIZATION>Gitano Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it agreed to buy 50% of <ORGANIZATION>Regatta Sport Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a closely held apparel maker, with the assumption of $3 million of contingent debt. 
Under the terms of the contract, New York-based <PERSON>Gitano</PERSON> has the option to acquire the remaining 50% of <ORGANIZATION>Regatta</ORGANIZATION>, a maker of men's and women's clothes sold primarily in department stores, under certain conditions.
That 50% is now held by <PERSON>Clifford Parker</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Regatta</ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer, who will continue to manage <ORGANIZATION>Regatta</ORGANIZATION>'s operations under <PERSON>Gitano</PERSON>.
In 1989, <ORGANIZATION>Regatta</ORGANIZATION> will have sales "in excess of $10 million" and will show a profit, <PERSON>Mr. Parker</PERSON> said. 
<PERSON>Gitano</PERSON>, which makes budget-priced apparel sold mainly through mass merchandisers like K mart and <PERSON>Wal-Mart</PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION>Regatta</ORGANIZATION> acquisition will enhance its strategy to expand into department stores.
This fall, <PERSON>Gitano</PERSON> began manufacturing moderately priced clothes aimed at department stores under the <ORGANIZATION>Gloria Vanderbilt</ORGANIZATION> trademark, which <PERSON>Gitano</PERSON> recently acquired. 
<ORGANIZATION>DD Acquisition</ORGANIZATION> is a partnership of <ORGANIZATION>Unicorp Canada Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Kingsbridge Capital Group</ORGANIZATION> unit and <ORGANIZATION>Cara Operations Ltd</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Dunkin' Donuts</ORGANIZATION> is based in <LOCATION>Randolph</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Cara Operations</ORGANIZATION>, a food services concern, and <ORGANIZATION>Unicorp</ORGANIZATION>, a holding company with interests in oil and natural gas and financial services, are based in <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>The Communications Workers of America</ORGANIZATION> ratified a new regional contract and all but one of the local agreements with <ORGANIZATION>Bell Atlantic Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>CWA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey Commercial</ORGANIZATION> local, which represents about 2,500 service representatives and marketing employees, rejected the tentative agreement.
Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>CWA</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers</ORGANIZATION> members remain on strike against <ORGANIZATION>Nynex Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the New York-based regional phone company.
The <ORGANIZATION>CWA</ORGANIZATION> represents 40,000 <ORGANIZATION>Nynex</ORGANIZATION> workers and the <ORGANIZATION>IBEW</ORGANIZATION> represents 20,000 workers. 
The computer maker, which sells more than half its goods outside the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, also said the negative effect of a stronger <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollar will "adversely affect" its fourth-quarter performance and "make it difficult" to better 1988 results. 
<ORGANIZATION>NCR</ORGANIZATION> said revenue declined both in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and overseas, reflecting a world-wide softening of the computer markets.
In addition to a general slowing of the computer industry, <ORGANIZATION>NCR</ORGANIZATION>, which sells automated teller machines and computerized cash registers, is also affected by the retail and financial sectors, "areas of the economy that have generally not been robust," notes <PERSON>Sanjiv G. Hingorani</PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>NCR</ORGANIZATION> shares fell 75 cents to close at $57. 
<ORGANIZATION>Newport News</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Va</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Herbert M. Sandler</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of the <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, savings-and-loan holding company, credited the high number of loans added to the company's portfolio over the last 12 months for broadening its earning asset base and improving profit performance. 
<ORGANIZATION>Hertz Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Park Ridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, said it retained <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ORGANIZATION> to sell its <ORGANIZATION>Hertz Equipment Rental Corp.</ORGANIZATION> unit. 
"There is no pressing need to sell the unit, but we are doing it so we can concentrate on our core business, renting automobiles in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and abroad," said <PERSON>William Slider</PERSON>, <PERSON>Hertz</PERSON>'s executive vice president. "We are only going to sell at the right price." 
<ORGANIZATION>Hertz Equipment</ORGANIZATION> is a major supplier of rental equipment in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION>
<PERSON>Vitro S.A.</PERSON> said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Anchor Glass Container Corp.</ORGANIZATION> for $21.25 a share, or $265 million, in the largest takeover of an American company by a Mexican concern. 
Yesterday's announcement of the accord culminated a two-month long battle for the <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, maker of bottles and other glass containers.
Anchor had been fighting <ORGANIZATION>Vitro</ORGANIZATION>'s earlier $20-a-share tender offer and agreed to the sweetened bid after a special committee of <ORGANIZATION>Anchor</ORGANIZATION>'s board put the company on the block.
The <LOCATION>Monterrey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, conglomerate also confirmed a previous announcement that it would acquire closely held <ORGANIZATION>Latchford Glass Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Huntington Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, in a separate transaction expected to close at the same time as the completion of the Anchor takeover.
<PERSON>Vitro</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Security Pacific National Bank</ORGANIZATION> committed $139 million to finance the purchase of Anchor and an affiliate of <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.</ORGANIZATION> committed $155 million in a bridge loan to finance the Anchor and <ORGANIZATION>Latchford</ORGANIZATION> acquisitions. 
Ernesto <PERSON>Martens R.</PERSON>,<PERSON>Vitro</PERSON>'s chief executive officer, said the company intends to keep Anchor based in <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION> and that the unit would be run independently by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> managers. 
Stock-index futures trading on the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION> and stock-index options trading on the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Board Options Exchange</ORGANIZATION> initially closed within a few minutes of each other Friday afternoon.
And when trading in the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Merc</ORGANIZATION>'s stock-index futures had finally halted for the day as well, sell orders cascaded onto the floor of the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, adding to the rout. 
<ORGANIZATION>Fossett Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, an options-trading firm, said last night that it is transferring all of its customer accounts to <ORGANIZATION>First Options of Chicago</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Stephen Fossett</PERSON>, president and sole owner of the company, said that he was making the transfers as a result of a substantial cash squeeze stemming from numerous calls for cash and margin money on Friday by several stock-option and futures exchanges. "All of our obligations were met," <PERSON>Mr. Fossett</PERSON> said. 
Although few other trading firms here or in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> appeared to be in immediate financial difficulty, Friday's volatility also underscored the need for exchanges in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> to hasten the common clearing of futures and options contracts, traders said. 
The trading halts in futures and options may have done more harm than good," said <PERSON>Jeffrey Tabak</PERSON>, a partner in the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION>Miller Tabak Hirsch & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, and a member of the presidential commission that recommended intermarket circuit breakers be adopted. 
The situation "is clearly uncorrected," said <PERSON>Glenn W. Clark</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, author on the futures markets. "All {a trading halt} does is smooth the movement." 
The <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 index future that expires in December closed at 328.85, nearly five index points below the 333.65 closing price of the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 index itself, which is based on the value of the 500 stocks in the index. 
Trading first halted in the <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor</ORGANIZATION>'s 500-stock index futures contract on the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION> at 2:07 p.m. CST, after the contract had fallen 12 index points.
When the <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> imposed its first halt in the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 futures contract after the 12-point drop, the stock index on which the contract is based went down from eight points to 13 points, roughly in line with the futures contract. 
<ORGANIZATION>Chicago Board Options Exchange</ORGANIZATION> officials, for instance, halted trading in their <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 100-stock index option contract, as expected, shortly after the <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> imposed its initial trading halt.
The <ORGANIZATION>CBOE</ORGANIZATION> decided not to reopen the nation's largest stock-index option market after the <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 index contract reopened and halted again a short time later. 
The <ORGANIZATION>CBOE</ORGANIZATION> action also may have driven prices lower in the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Merc</ORGANIZATION>'s huge <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 index futures pit, traders said.
As much as 25% of the volume in <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 futures on most days comes from <ORGANIZATION>CBOE</ORGANIZATION> traders hedging their risks in the options markets.
As a result, one of the largest options-trading firms in the country offered to sell 1,000 <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 contracts at the limit of 30 index points below the previous day's close, an <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 futures trader said.
With the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> markets closed, traders were left with no choice but to "bang the bids {sell stocks} in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Mr. Tabak</PERSON> said. 
To provide an added cash cushion to compensate for the increased price volatility in their markets, the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Merc</ORGANIZATION> required traders to increase the margin, or amount of cash they put up to trade <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 500 contracts, by one-third to $12,000 a contract from $9,000, effective this morning.
The <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Merc</ORGANIZATION> has begun limited cross-margining of stock-index futures accounts with the <ORGANIZATION>Options Clearing Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which processes all options trades for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> exchanges.
Among those sighing with relief was <PERSON>John H. Gutfreund</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers</ORGANIZATION>, who took to the firm's trading floor to monitor yesterday's events.
By 10:10, the <ORGANIZATION>Dow Industrials</ORGANIZATION> were off 63.52 points, and the stock of <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, whose troubles had kicked off Friday's plunge, still hadn't opened. 
And many arbitragers, already reeling from Friday's collapse of the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> deal, were further hurt yesterday when a proposed takeover of <ORGANIZATION>AMR Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, collapsed.
In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, a midday rally left the market's major index off 3.2%, and <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s leading stock index fell only 1.8% in surprisingly lackluster trading.
Other, more thinly traded <LOCATION>Asian</LOCATION> markets were hit harder than <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s, but there were no free-fall declines. 
<PERSON>Stephen Boesel</PERSON>, a major money manager for <ORGANIZATION>T. Rowe Price</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>, says, "There was less panic than in 1987: We had been through it once." In <LOCATION>Somerset</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Adrian Sween</PERSON>, who owns a supplier of nursing-home equipment and isn't active in the stock market, agrees. "I look at it as a ho-hum matter," he says. 
In <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> trading room, some 40 traders and assistants sat quietly, with few orders to process.
The relative calm in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> proved little comfort to markets opening up in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>'s opening was delayed a half hour because of a crush of sell orders. "The beginning was chaotic," says <PERSON>Nigel Longley</PERSON>, a broker for <ORGANIZATION>Commerzbank</ORGANIZATION> 
In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, the view from the trading floor of an American securities firm, <ORGANIZATION>Jefferies & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, also was troubling.
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s blue-chip stock index turned up just before 8 a.m. <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> time, sending an encouraging message to Wall Street. 
But shortly before then, some of Wall Street's sharpest traders say, they sensed a turn. "The first thing that caught my eye that was encouraging was <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bonds were off," says <PERSON>Austin George</PERSON>, head of stock trading at <ORGANIZATION>T. Rowe Price</ORGANIZATION>. "It meant that people weren't running pell-mell to the safety of bonds." 
Shortly after 10 a.m., the Major Market Index, a <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Board of Trade</ORGANIZATION> futures contract of 20 stocks designed to mimic the <ORGANIZATION>DJIA</ORGANIZATION>, exploded upward.
"The <ORGANIZATION>MMI</ORGANIZATION> has gone better," shouted a trader in the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> trading room went wild.
Traders shouted out as their <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Quotron</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Telerate</ORGANIZATION> screens posted an ever-narrowing loss on Wall Street.
Then, nine minutes later, Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day. "Rally, rally, rally," shouted <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Andy Rosen</PERSON>. "This is panic buying." Major blue-chip stocks like <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>General Motors and Proctor & Gamble</ORGANIZATION> led the rally. 
German and Dutch investors reportedly loaded up on <ORGANIZATION>Kellogg Co</ORGANIZATION>. Then, traders say, corporations with share buy-back programs kicked into high gear, triggering gains in, among other issues, <PERSON>Alcan Aluminium</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's</ORGANIZATION>. 
Typical, perhaps, was <ORGANIZATION>Batterymarch</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Dean LeBaron</PERSON>.
The carnage on the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Board Options Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, the nation's major options market, was heavy after the trading in <ORGANIZATION>S&P</ORGANIZATION> 100 stock-index options was halted Friday.
<PERSON>Charles Clough</PERSON>, a strategist at <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION>, says bargain hunting had explained the <ORGANIZATION>Dow</ORGANIZATION>'s strength up to that point and that many market professionals were anticipating a drop in the Dow.
Moreover, the announcement that real estate magnate and sometime raider <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> was withdrawing his offer for <ORGANIZATION>AMR Corp.</ORGANIZATION> might have been expected to rattle traders. 
Says <PERSON>James Norman</PERSON>, the mayor of <LOCATION>Ava</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>: "I don't invest in stocks.
<PERSON>Ralph Holzfaster</PERSON>, a farmer and farm-supply store operator in <LOCATION>Ogallala</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neb.</LOCATION>, says of the last few days events, "If anything good comes out of this, it might be that it puts some of these LBOs on the skids." 
Says <ORGANIZATION>Gordon Fines</ORGANIZATION>, a money manager at <ORGANIZATION>IDS Financial Services</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, "You're on a roller coaster, and that may last.
The dollar's fall on Friday could signal a new bout of weakness for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> currency and -- if it declines much further -- possibly the end of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> currency's long-term climb that began in early 1988. 
"The entire sentiment has changed; the dollar bulls definitely have been shaken," says <PERSON>Jack Kessler</PERSON>, senior vice president in charge of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> foreign-exchange operations for <LOCATION>Chase Manhattan Bank</LOCATION>. 
He and others cite Friday's plunge in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stock prices and the narrowing difference between interest rates in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and some of its major trading partners, particularly <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
In <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Monday, the dollar opened for trading at 139.30 yen, down from Friday's <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> close of 144 yen, and 1.8340 marks down from Friday's close of 1.8720.
"If the stock market keeps going down on Monday, you're going to see a lot of people selling dollars," says <PERSON>Robert Fio Rito</PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION>Harris Trust & Savings Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>.
In the short-run, the dollar's fate depends largely on the performance of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stock market today as well as the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>'s and other central banks' reaction to what happens in all world equity markets, say traders and analysts. 
Not only does the dollar play a key role in determining the direction and health of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economy, but the speed with which it rises or falls is also of major concern to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and foreign policy makers. 
A precipitous fall by the dollar could reignite <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> inflationary pressures by raising the price of imports and prompting <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> manufacturers to increase domestic prices. 
But if the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> currency were to decline in a controlled manner, it would contribute to the four-year effort by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and its major trading partners to reduce the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade deficit and correspondingly large Japanese and West German surpluses.
Furthermore, in the current stock market climate, the dollar is the wire through which foreigners telegraph their preference -- or distaste -- for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> securities and signal their confidence in the <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> economy and financial system. 
Surprisingly, while trading was hectic, dealers say that volume was unexpectedly moderate. "You're talking about a really thin and volatile Friday the 13th," says <PERSON>Carmine Rotondo</PERSON>, chief corporate dealer for <ORGANIZATION>Security Pacific National Bank</ORGANIZATION>. 
"The decline of the dollar was more a function of market makers dragging bids down than people massively selling," adds <PERSON>Richard Witten</PERSON>, vice president in charge of foreign-exchange operations at <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>G-7</ORGANIZATION> includes the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. 
"For all of its unfortunate aspects, Friday's events make it easier for the <ORGANIZATION>G-7</ORGANIZATION> process to continue," says <PERSON>Robert Feldman</PERSON>, an international economist at <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
In the past week and a half, major <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> countries -- led by <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> -- raised official domestic interest rates, mostly to keep their currencies from falling further and to stem the inflationary impact of those declines. 
<PERSON>Mr. Feldman</PERSON> added: "But that's not the way things look now; the <ORGANIZATION>G-7</ORGANIZATION> have some breathing room." 
Analysts say that the dollar's future depends on whether <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stock prices keep falling; whether the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> is forced to ease credit to ease any crisis; whether foreign equity markets also fall, and how central banks abroad react to those circumstances. 
"If nothing happens abroad and the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> is forced to ease here to calm markets, the dollar is going to go down; there would be a flight to quality as people start to worry about the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> financial system," says <PERSON>Michael D. Andrews</PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co</ORGANIZATION>.
In fact, <PERSON>Mr. Andrews</PERSON> and some other traders and analysts say that it isn't impossible to paint a scenario where the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> might have to intervene to support the dollar.
Analysts believe that the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> can tolerate a dollar as low as 1.80 marks, a level at which <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies are competitive in overseas markets and yet isn't too inflationary domestically. 
Some of that already began on Friday. "Many of the banks in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> called their counterparts in the Far East and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>," says <PERSON>Chase Manhattan</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Mr. Kessler</PERSON>. 
"And dealers who had gone home in the Far East and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> long dollars started selling when they were awakened during the night and told that the stock market was down, that <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> funds were at 8 3/4% and that the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> might begin to ease," <PERSON>Mr. Kessler</PERSON> adds. 
<ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers</ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON>Mr. Feldman</PERSON> says that further evidence of foreign selling was the dollar's plunge Friday at the same time the bond market was rallying -- which hasn't occurred in months. "That may be a signal of a turning point in the strategies of international portfolio managers," he says. 
<ORGANIZATION>Harris Trust</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Fio Rito</PERSON> predicts that "an equity market hit will trigger further liquidation; with the Japanese and Germans raising {interest} rates, the fundamentals changed for the dollar." 
Indeed, <ORGANIZATION>Salomon</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Feldman</PERSON> notes that in September yields on three-month Eurodollar deposits were 1.5 percentage points more than on three-month marks.
Many dealers are looking to see if the dollar tumbles below 1.85 marks, a key psychological and technical level to the many traders who use charts to predict currency movements. "It breaks through 1.85, then you begin to question whether the dollar's long-term uptrend that began in early 1988 is still in place," says <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Andrews</PERSON>. 
"I see a stronger dollar mid to long-term," says <PERSON>Gilles Bazy-Sire</PERSON>, a first vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Societe Generale Securities Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
Dollar doubters point to the prospects of a bumpy <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stock market at best, and the prospect of lower <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> interest rates.
Barring a catastrophe in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stock market, <PERSON>Mr. Kessler</PERSON> believes that the dollar in the near term should weaken further to about 1.8650-1.8850 marks and 142-143.50 yen.
On the <ORGANIZATION>Commodity Exchange</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Friday, gold for current delivery settled at $363.30 an ounce, down 10 cents.
<ORGANIZATION>J.P. Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it signed a definitive agreement to sell its <ORGANIZATION>Builders' Hardware Group</ORGANIZATION> to closely held <ORGANIZATION>Nalcor Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. 
Terms weren't disclosed, but a <ORGANIZATION>J.P. Industries</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the amount <ORGANIZATION>J.P. Industries</ORGANIZATION> will get for the group is "a little better than expected by the marketplace, and the marketplace had been expecting $25 million to $30 million." 
The group consists of <ORGANIZATION>Weslock Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>JPI Modern Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>J.P. Industries</ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION>Ann Arbor</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, said the sale completes a previously announced program to divest itself of its hardware and plumbing supplies operations.
<PERSON>Richard G. Sim</PERSON>, the man credited with transforming <ORGANIZATION>Applied Power Inc.</ORGANIZATION> from an underachiever into a feisty player in the global market for hydraulic tools, hopes to guide a similar turnaround at the company's latest acquisition, <ORGANIZATION>Barry Wright Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <LOCATION>Watertown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, company's sales have been dormant and its profits have dropped.
Besides spurring <PERSON>Barry Wright</PERSON>'s sales, which were $201.7 million in 1988, <PERSON>Mr. Sim</PERSON> must pare its costs and product line. "The question is how long it's going to take <PERSON>Barry Wright</PERSON> to make a contribution," says F. <PERSON>John Mirek</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Blunt Ellis Loewi</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Milwaukee</LOCATION>. 
The Butler, <LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION>, manufacturer went public at $15.75 a share in August 1987, and <PERSON>Mr. Sim</PERSON>'s goal then was a $29 per-share price by 1992.
In <PERSON>Barry Wright</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Sim</PERSON> sees a situation "very similar" to the one he faced when he joined Applied as president and chief operating officer in 1985.
<PERSON>Mr. Sim</PERSON> is confident that the drive to dominate certain niche markets will work at <PERSON>Barry Wright</PERSON> as it has at Applied.
<PERSON>Mr. Sim</PERSON> considers the new unit's operations "fundamentally sound" and adds that <PERSON>Barry Wright</PERSON> has been fairly successful in moving into markets that haven't interested larger competitors. "With a little patience, these businesses will perform very satisfactorily," <PERSON>Mr. Sim</PERSON> says.
<PERSON>Mr. Sim</PERSON> figures it will be easier to turn <PERSON>Barry Wright</PERSON> around since he's now in the driver's seat.
<ORGANIZATION>National Heritage</ORGANIZATION> stock fell 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $1.375 a share in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading. 
The <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> adopted two specific circuit breakers: If the <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> index falls 250 points in a day, the exchange will halt trading for one hour; if the decline hits 400 points, the exchange will close for an additional two hours.
The futures exchanges followed their own pre-set circuit breakers and shut down at about 3 p.m. for 30 minutes, after the <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor</ORGANIZATION>'s 500 stock index had fallen 12 points, or about 100 points on the <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> index.
Should the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Commodities Futures Trading Commission</ORGANIZATION> (which, with the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>, regulates the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> stock-index markets) be unable to agree, the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> secretary. 
<PERSON>Mr. Freund</PERSON>, former chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, is a professor of economics at <ORGANIZATION>Pace University</ORGANIZATION>'s business school in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
Yesterday was, in the words of <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>John J. Phelan Jr.</PERSON>, just your "reasonably normal, 400 million-share, up 88-points day." 
The so-called circuit breakers devised by the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION> to quell free falls in stock and futures prices weren't triggered yesterday because the markets were higher for most of the day. 
Despite traders' complaints, <PERSON>Mr. Phelan</PERSON> said the links with the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> futures market worked as planned in Friday's rout to provide a cooling-off period.
FOREIGN PRIME RATES: <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> 13.50%; <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> 8.50%; <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> 4.875%; <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> 8.50%; <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> 15%.
<ORGANIZATION>FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORP.</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Freddie Mac</ORGANIZATION>): Posted yields on 30-year mortgage commitments for delivery within 30 days. 9.83%, standard conventional fixedrate mortgages; 7.875%, 2% rate capped one-year adjustable rate mortgages.
<ORGANIZATION>FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Fannie Mae</ORGANIZATION>): Posted yields on 30 year mortgage commitments for delivery within 30 days (priced at par).9.82%, standard conventional fixed rate-mortgages; 8.70%, 6/2 rate capped one-year adjustable rate mortgages.
The barometer, developed by analysts at <ORGANIZATION>Columbia University</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Center for International Business Cycle Research</ORGANIZATION> here, reached a record high of 223.0 in August, the latest month available, and the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> researchers estimate that it has moved even higher since then. 
But the far stronger showing of the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> index "makes a recession any time soon highly unlikely," says <PERSON>Geoffrey H. Moore</PERSON>, the director of the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> facility. 
A leading authority on the business cycle, <PERSON>Mr. Moore</PERSON> also is a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Business Cycle Dating Group</ORGANIZATION>, the panel of private economists that decides for the government when expansions and recessions begin and end.
A major source of the recent strength in the long leading indicator has been the performance of the <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> corporate bond-price index, which is not a part of the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> index.
Notably absent from the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> index is the stock market, which <PERSON>Mr. Moore</PERSON> says "is simply no longer such a good indicator of the economy's long-range prospects, though it still is useful for anticipating some short-run twists and turns." 
As recently as 1975, the stock market -- as reflected in the <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor</ORGANIZATION>'s index of 500 common stocks -- was rated by the <ORGANIZATION>National Bureau of Economic Research</ORGANIZATION> as the best of the 12 leading indicators that then made up the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> index.
"The pendulum is swinging back to black and white," says <PERSON>Richard DeMoulin</PERSON>, the general manager of <ORGANIZATION>Eastman Kodak Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's professional photography division. 
The <LOCATION>Rochester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, photographic giant recently began marketing T-Max 3200, one of the fastest and most sensitive monochrome films.
Also trying to snare a portion of the $2 billion-a-year industry is <ORGANIZATION>Agfa Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Bayer AG</ORGANIZATION>. Agfa recently signed Olympic gold medalist <PERSON>Florence Griffith-Joyner</PERSON> to endorse a new line of black-and-white paper that's geared to consumers and will compete directly with <PERSON>Kodak</PERSON>'s papers.
The biggest beneficiary of the black-and-white revival is likely to be <ORGANIZATION>International Paper Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Ilford</ORGANIZATION> division, known in the industry for its premium products.
Sales of <LOCATION>Ilford</LOCATION>'s four varieties of black-and-white film this year are outpacing growth in the overall market, although the company won't say by exactly how much. "We hope the trend lasts," says <PERSON>Laurie DiCara</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Ilford</ORGANIZATION>'s marketing communications director. 
For baby boomers who grew up being photographed in color, black and white seems eye-catching and exotic. "It has an archival, almost nostalgic quality to it," says <PERSON>Owen B. Butler</PERSON>, the chairman of the applied photography department at <ORGANIZATION>Rochester Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>. "You can shift out of reality with black and white," he adds. 
<ORGANIZATION>Consider Gap Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, whose latest ad campaign features black-and-white shots of <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> stars, artists and other well-known personalities modeling the retailer's jeans and T-shirts.
Companies "feel black and white will convey a stronger statement," says <PERSON>Marc L. Hauser</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> photographer who is working on a black-and-white print ad for <ORGANIZATION>Stouffer Food Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's Lean Cuisine.
Other companies that are currently using two-tone ads include <ORGANIZATION>American Express Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Epson America Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
His On-Broadway Photography studio in <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, doubled its business last year and, he says, is booked solid for the next five. 
The kit, which has a suggested retail price of $250 and has already become a bestseller, was introduced after retailers noticed numerous requests from parents for children's photography equipment. "It seems computers as hobbies have waned," says <PERSON>Ian Brightman</PERSON>, <PERSON>Beseler</PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive officer. 
"Black and white hasn't made the same quantum leaps in technological development as color," says <PERSON>Mr. Butler</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Rochester Institute</ORGANIZATION>. "The color print today is far superior to prints of 10 years ago.
But when <ORGANIZATION>Popular Photography</ORGANIZATION>, a leading magazine for photographers, selected 15 of the greatest photos ever made for its latest issue celebrating photography's 150th anniversary, all were black and white. "It's got a classic spirit and carries over emotionally," says <ORGANIZATION>Alfred DeBat of Professional Photographers of America</ORGANIZATION>. "That's the appeal." 
After a long day tending the searing, blackened furnaces of the <ORGANIZATION>Panzhihua Iron & Steel Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Li Wankui</PERSON> would like to relax away from the factory.
Sitting at home with his family around the dining table, <PERSON>Mr. Li</PERSON> turns on the evening news. "This is the <ORGANIZATION>Panzhihua Factory</ORGANIZATION> broadcasting station," a perky anchorwoman says. "And here's what happened today at our factory." 
Nestled in the remote mountains of southern <LOCATION>Sichuan</LOCATION> province about 1,200 miles southwest of <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>, it is virtually cut off from the rest of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>.
They truck in fresh fish from the east coast and import television sets from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. "A Chinese factory director could be a mayor in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>," says <PERSON>Mr. Li</PERSON>. "But I don't think an <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> mayor could handle a <LOCATION>Chinese</LOCATION> factory." 
Life in the <LOCATION>Panzhihua</LOCATION> factory beats a regular rhythm, and fully absorbs workers such as <PERSON>Mr. Li</PERSON>.
They read speeches from top leaders and slam <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sanctions on <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> imposed after the June 4 massacre of pro-democracy protesters in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>. "We want to make sure that workers have a correct opinion about events," says <PERSON>Yuan Changyong</PERSON>, the local <ORGANIZATION>Party</ORGANIZATION> chief. 
<PERSON>Zhang Shanyun</PERSON>, one of <PERSON>Mr. Li</PERSON>'s bosses, knows the system well.
It turned out that few workers here in the hills of <LOCATION>Sichuan</LOCATION> had ever seen them, so the factory TV station ran a broadcast on the correct way to eat <LOCATION>Guangdong</LOCATION> crabs. 
<PERSON>Mr. Li</PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON>Xia Huaqiong</PERSON>, also works at the factory, tending the water meters during the graveyard shift.
There are few prospects for upward mobility, and <PERSON>Mr. Li</PERSON>'s daughter, seven-year-old <PERSON>Li Shu</PERSON>, is certain to toil at the factory too someday, as are more than 10,000 of the workers' children. 
<PERSON>Li Shu</PERSON> is in the second grade at the <ORGANIZATION>Xiangyang Village Elementary School for Workers</ORGANIZATION>' Children, one of 31 schools subsidized by the factory at a cost of more than half a million dollars a year.
He pulls out a newspaper: The <ORGANIZATION>Panzhihua Iron & Steel Co</ORGANIZATION>. Daily. "It's a good read," <PERSON>Mr. Li</PERSON> says. "Quite informative." Today's lead story: "Manager Zhao Inspects Operation of No. 4 Furnace." 
Not surprisingly in this remote outpost, many of the single factory workers here fall in love with each other. "We have a very small social circle," says <PERSON>Ma Yongjian</PERSON>, the company secretary general. "A lot of the young workers end up getting married." To facilitate such productive arrangements, the factory organizes dances each night, often outdoors on a concrete promenade along the banks of the <LOCATION>Jinshajiang River</LOCATION>. 
As the band plays, and with romance in the air, <PERSON>Mr. Li</PERSON> recalls how he came to <LOCATION>Panzhihua</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mao</PERSON> was sure that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, or perhaps the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, was planning to attack <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s coast, so he decided to set up vital industries deep in the remote interior. 
Like tens of thousands of others, <PERSON>Mr. Li</PERSON> was ordered to go to <LOCATION>Panzhihua</LOCATION>, in 1971. "I lived in a straw-and-mud house at the time," he says. "But I was happy to be here, to carry on the fight against the imperialists and the revisionists." Today the perceived threat has passed, but the factory is thriving. 
What keeps <PERSON>Mr. Li</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Panzhihua</LOCATION>?
The <PERSON>Li</PERSON> family could apply for permission to do so, but hasn't tried. "I expect I'll be in <LOCATION>Panzhihua</LOCATION> for the rest of my life," <PERSON>Mr. Li</PERSON> says. "The No. 1 high school is pretty good, and I have to think of my daughter's future." 
<PERSON>Ma Zhijie</PERSON>, deputy general manager of the factory's trading department, wants his eight-year-old son to have broader horizons, and believes education is the best ticket out of <LOCATION>Panzhihua</LOCATION>.
At one point, <PERSON>Mr. Li</PERSON> repeats the theme of a recent political study class and harangues his American visitor about <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sanctions against <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. "The Chinese and <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> people have great warmth for each other," <PERSON>Mr. Li</PERSON> says, "but I must tell you frankly that I disagree with President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s policy toward <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>." 
Many of these Americans were incensed by the killings in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> and denounced the <LOCATION>Chinese</LOCATION> government. "Well, I certainly didn't know any of that," <PERSON>Mr. Li</PERSON> says, and abruptly closes the conversation. 
When <PERSON>Mr. Li</PERSON> dies, <ORGANIZATION>Panzhihua Iron & Steel</ORGANIZATION> will pay for his cremation. 
<PERSON>Mr. Zhong</PERSON> motions to the wriggling bundles. "These," he says, "are the future workers of <ORGANIZATION>Panzhihua Iron & Steel</ORGANIZATION>." 
Four of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s biggest banks said they plan to sell jointly owned <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire Bank Group</ORGANIZATION> in an auction that could raise between #850 million ($1.33 billion) and #1 billion ($1.57 billion). 
<ORGANIZATION>National Westminster Bank PLC</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s biggest holder with a 40% stake, said it, <ORGANIZATION>Barclays PLC</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Lloyds Bank PLC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC</ORGANIZATION> decided to sell the 250-branch <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> bank after receiving "a number of approaches" from potential purchasers.
At a news conference here yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>NatWest</ORGANIZATION> officials said they expect potential interest from banks throughout continental <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
<ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire Bank</ORGANIZATION>, which had pretax profit of #100.4 million and #3.19 billion in assets last year, has <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s ninth-largest branch network.
It is viewed by market analysts as a potential target for banks aiming to boost their <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> presence prior to the 1992 development of a single market in financial services in the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Bill Barron</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>NatWest</ORGANIZATION> general manager, said the banks decided to push ahead with the sale despite yesterday's sharp stock-market fall in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> because the decision was strategic and independent of market valuations. 
The consortium-ownership arrangement, which dates from a financial reconstruction of <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire Bank</ORGANIZATION> in 1911, is outmoded for the increasingly competitive <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> market, analysts say.
<ORGANIZATION>Barclays</ORGANIZATION> owns 32%, <ORGANIZATION>Lloyds</ORGANIZATION> owns 20% and <ORGANIZATION>Royal Bank of Scotland</ORGANIZATION> owns 8% of <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire Bank</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>LAC Minerals Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> said it agreed to buy 65% of Denver-based <ORGANIZATION>Bond International Gold Inc.</ORGANIZATION> for $10 a share, or $373.8 million. 
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Bond International</ORGANIZATION> closed unchanged at $8.75. 
The purchase helps <ORGANIZATION>LAC</ORGANIZATION> make up for a court decision earlier this year in which it lost a long legal battle with Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION>Corona Corp.</ORGANIZATION> for control of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s richest gold mine.
The <ORGANIZATION>Bond International</ORGANIZATION> stake would roughly double <ORGANIZATION>LAC</ORGANIZATION>'s gold production and substantially reduce its average cost of producing gold. 
Last year, <ORGANIZATION>Bond International</ORGANIZATION> spent an average $204 to produce an ounce of gold at mines in <LOCATION>North</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> and in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, significantly lower than <ORGANIZATION>LAC</ORGANIZATION>'s own average cost of $260 an ounce.
Analysts say the real jewel in the <ORGANIZATION>Bond International</ORGANIZATION> crown is its 83% stake in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>El Indio</LOCATION> mine, which they say had production costs of below $100 an ounce. 
The spokesman said <ORGANIZATION>LAC</ORGANIZATION> has no intentions "right now" to further increase its stake in <ORGANIZATION>Bond International</ORGANIZATION>. 
<LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Harold Simmons</PERSON> says he hasn't decided to sell his <ORGANIZATION>Lockheed Corp.</ORGANIZATION> shares, after all. 
In a terse news release responding to an article yesterday in <ORGANIZATION>The Wall Street Journal</ORGANIZATION>, which credited a front-page interview story in the Sunday <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Daily News</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Valhi Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said the quotes in the articles "do not accurately reflect <ORGANIZATION>Valhi</ORGANIZATION>'s and <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON>'s intentions" concerning their interests in <LOCATION>Lockheed</LOCATION>.
Through <ORGANIZATION>Valhi</ORGANIZATION> and its affiliates, <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON> holds a 10.43% stake in the aerospace and electronics concern, and his plans concerning <ORGANIZATION>Lockheed</ORGANIZATION> have been the subject of much speculation among securities analysts. 
In the <ORGANIZATION>Daily News</ORGANIZATION> story, <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON> was quoted as saying, among other things: "Actually, I wish I were out of <LOCATION>Lockheed</LOCATION>.
Yesterday's statement by <PERSON>Valhi</PERSON> said the quotes "take out of context and paraphrase statements made by <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON> in jest at the conclusion of a lengthy interview." The true position is that <ORGANIZATION>Valhi</ORGANIZATION> and its affiliates, as they have said in public filings, "may increase, decrease or retain their Lockheed holdings" depending on a number of conditions. 
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Lockheed</ORGANIZATION> shares closed yesterday at $46.25 a share, off $1.75. 
<PERSON>Douglas R. Dowie</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Daily News</ORGANIZATION> managing editor for news, said "the quotes in the Daily News were in context and were not in jest." The report of the interview, which was recorded, was "absolutely correct," he added. 
A spokesman for <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON> declined to elaborate on the <ORGANIZATION>Valhi</ORGANIZATION> statement, and said <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON> wouldn't be available to answer questions about his remarks to the Daily News. 
<LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Harold Simmons</PERSON>, who has been gobbling up <ORGANIZATION>Lockheed Corp.</ORGANIZATION> shares and only two months ago told this newspaper that he was in the stock for the long term, now insists he wants to sell. 
In an interview published yesterday with the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Daily News</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON> said: "Lockheed is actually just a decoy.
<PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON>, who holds 6.6 million shares, or a 10.43% stake, in <LOCATION>Lockheed</LOCATION>, added that he isn't at all interested in taking over the <LOCATION>Calabasas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, aerospace concern. "Not now and not ever," he told the newspaper. "Actually, I wish I were out of <LOCATION>Lockheed</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Lockheed</ORGANIZATION>'s share price on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> has been propped up in recent weeks, despite disappointing earnings, because of <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON>'s interest in the company.
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Lockheed</ORGANIZATION> slipped $1 in Friday's market slump to close at $48 a share. 
<PERSON>Michael Lamb</PERSON>, who closely tracks <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON>'s holdings for a <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>, firm called <ORGANIZATION>Wealth Monitors</ORGANIZATION>, said he is skeptical about the stated intention to sell off <ORGANIZATION>Lockheed</ORGANIZATION> shares.
He added that while one Simmons holding company, <ORGANIZATION>Valhi Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, has sold 272,000 <ORGANIZATION>Lockheed</ORGANIZATION> shares in recent months, his other companies have bought up 880,000. 
<PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON> couldn't be reached to elaborate, and <ORGANIZATION>Lockheed</ORGANIZATION> officials couldn't be reached to comment on the <ORGANIZATION>Daily News</ORGANIZATION> article. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Lamb</PERSON> said it's <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON>'s style to try and leave Wall Street befuddled.
He said <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON> knows the arbitrage community "can be a detriment by driving the share price up." <PERSON>Mr. Lamb</PERSON> said if the arbitrageurs get confused, maybe they'll move out of the stock and leave more for <PERSON>Mr. Simmons</PERSON> to grab. 
<PERSON>Arthur M. Goldberg</PERSON> said he extended his unsolicited tender offer of $32 a share tender offer, or $154.3 million, for <ORGANIZATION>Di Giorgio Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to Nov. 1. 
<ORGANIZATION>DIG Acquisition Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> investor's acquisition vehicle, said that as of the close of business yesterday, 560,839 shares had been tendered.
Including the stake DIG already held, <ORGANIZATION>DIG</ORGANIZATION> holds a total of about 25% of <ORGANIZATION>Di Giorgio</ORGANIZATION>'s shares on a fully diluted basis. 
DIG is a unit of <ORGANIZATION>DIG Holding Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Rose Partners L.P.</ORGANIZATION> <PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON> is the sole general partner in <ORGANIZATION>Rose Partners</ORGANIZATION>. 
In August, <PERSON>Di Giorgio</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> food products and building materials marketing and distribution company, rejected <PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON>'s offer as inadequate. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Di Giorgio</ORGANIZATION> closed at $31.50 a share, down $1.75. 
<ORGANIZATION>Burmah Oil PLC</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> independent oil and specialty chemicals marketing concern, said <ORGANIZATION>SHV Holdings N.V.</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION> has built up a 6.7% stake in the company. 
<PERSON>James Alexander</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Burmah</LOCATION> spokesman, said <ORGANIZATION>SHV</ORGANIZATION> had previously owned "a little under 5%" of <LOCATION>Burmah</LOCATION> for about two years.
<ORGANIZATION>SHV</ORGANIZATION>, which last year merged its <LOCATION>North Sea</LOCATION> oil and gas operations with those of <ORGANIZATION>Calor Group PLC</ORGANIZATION>, has been pegged by speculators as a possible suitor for <ORGANIZATION>Burmah Oil</ORGANIZATION> in recent weeks.
<LOCATION>Burmah</LOCATION>, which owns the <ORGANIZATION>Castrol</ORGANIZATION> brand of lubricant oils, reported a 17% rise in net income to #43.5 million ($68.3 million) in the first half. 
<ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, is the market leader for traditional microprocessors with its 8086 family that forms the heart of IBM-compatible personal computers. 
Under the agreement, <ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION> will invest $3 million to acquire a 4% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Alliant</ORGANIZATION>, a maker of minisupercomputers for scientists and engineers.
<ORGANIZATION>Alliant</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Littleton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, will license its parallel-computing technologies to <ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION>, providing users a way to let many i860 microprocessors in a single computer work on a problem simultaneously.
<ORGANIZATION>DPC Acquisition Partners</ORGANIZATION>, a hostile suitor for <ORGANIZATION>Dataproducts Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said it intends to launch a tender offer for the computer printer maker's common stock. 
<ORGANIZATION>DPC</ORGANIZATION>, a group led by the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION>Crescott Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, also said it plans to file preliminary materials with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> regarding a shareholder solicitation to oust <ORGANIZATION>Dataproducts</ORGANIZATION>' board. 
<ORGANIZATION>DPC</ORGANIZATION> holds a 7.8% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Dataproducts</ORGANIZATION> and made a $15-a-share bid for the company in May, but <ORGANIZATION>Dataproducts</ORGANIZATION> management considered the $283.7 million proposal unacceptable.
In <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Dataproducts</ORGANIZATION> shares jumped 62.5 cents to close at $9.375. 
As part of the plan, <ORGANIZATION>Dataproducts</ORGANIZATION> announced a pact to sell $63 million of its real estate holdings to <ORGANIZATION>Trizec Properties Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Trizec Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Jack Davis</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Dataproducts</ORGANIZATION>' president, chairman and chief executive officer, said the company "is at a loss to understand <ORGANIZATION>DPC</ORGANIZATION>'s intentions." He called today's announcement "opportunistic and disruptive" and said the company intends to proceed with its restructuring. 
<ORGANIZATION>United Biscuits</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Holdings</ORGANIZATION>) <ORGANIZATION>PLC</ORGANIZATION>, a British food producer, announced the creation of a European group to bring together its trading interests in the region. 
"The new structure will enable <ORGANIZATION>United Biscuits</ORGANIZATION> to focus clearly upon opportunities for planned growth during the 1990s," said <PERSON>Bob Clarke</PERSON>, deputy chairman and group chief executive. 
Last month, <ORGANIZATION>United Biscuits</ORGANIZATION> agreed to sell its entire restaurant operations to <ORGANIZATION>Grand Metropolitan PLC</ORGANIZATION> for #180 million. 
The <ORGANIZATION>House Aviation Subcommittee</ORGANIZATION> approved a bill that would give the transportation secretary authority to review and approve leveraged buy-outs of major <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> airlines. 
The collapsed plan to acquire <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, spurred quick action on the legislation, introduced Wednesday and approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday.
The measure drew criticism from the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration and a parting shot from financier <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>, who yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION>AMR Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION>.
In a letter to subcommittee Chairman <PERSON>James Oberstar</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Minn.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> criticized the bill as an explicit effort to thwart his bid for <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION>, and said it contributed to the collapse of the deal. 
Rep. <PERSON>Oberstar</PERSON> brushed off <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>'s allegations as an "excuse for his own deal failing." He also said the fact that the other letter hadn't come from <ORGANIZATION>Transportation</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Samuel Skinner</PERSON> indicated there is "wiggle room" in the administration's position. 
But they cited the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> examples as reasons to move quickly to enact this legislation. 
Aides both in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> said the withdrawal of the Trump bid for <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> isn't likely to deflate efforts to push the legislation. "It's still on the fast track and we still want to do it," said one <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> aide. 
In general, the bill would give the <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION> a 30-day review period before 15% or more of the voting stock of a major <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> air carrier could be acquired.
But several committee members disapproved, some backing <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>'s claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> deal and the stock-market plunge. 
<PERSON>Steve Clark</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ORGANIZATION> trader, reported for work at 5 a.m., two and a half hours before the usual Monday morning strategy meeting. 
<ORGANIZATION>At Jefferies & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>J. Francis Palamara</PERSON> didn't reach the office until 5:30 a.m., but then he had been up most of the night at home. "I had calls all night long from the <LOCATION>States</LOCATION>," he said. "I was woken up every hour -- 1:30, 2:30, 3:30, 4:30.
<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> stocks closed off a significant but less-than-alarming 1.8% on thin volume; <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> stocks declined 6.5% in orderly trading. 
At <ORGANIZATION>Jefferies</ORGANIZATION>' trading room on Finsbury Circus, a stately circle at the edge of the financial district, desktop computer screens displayed the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> market's major barometer -- the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index.
"I see concern, but I don't see any panic," said <PERSON>Mr. Palamara</PERSON>, a big, good-humored <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> native who runs the 15-trader office. 
"All the takeover stocks -- <ORGANIZATION>Scottish & Newcastle</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>B.A.T</ORGANIZATION>, DRG -- are getting pretty well pasted this morning," <PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON> said.
"Because <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> didn't collapse, let's pick up a little stock," <PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON> said.
"When I want to buy, they run from you -- they keep changing their prices," <PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON> said. "It's very frustrating." He temporarily abandoned his search for the <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> shares. 
By this time, it was 4:30 a.m. in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON> fielded a call from a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> customer wanting an opinion on the <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> stock market, which had been having troubles of its own even before Friday's <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> market break. 
By midday, the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> market was in full retreat. "It's falling like a stone," said <PERSON>Danny Linger</PERSON>, a pit trader who was standing outside the <ORGANIZATION>London International Financial Futures Exchange</ORGANIZATION>.
"<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> opened the limit down, off at least 10% if you could calculate the index, which you couldn't," <PERSON>Mr. Clark</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> trader, said early in the afternoon. "<LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> is down 10% and suspended, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s down 8%, <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> 11%.
As 2:30 p.m. -- Wall Street's opening time -- neared, <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> traders and salesmen traded bets on how low the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> market would open. 
In the center of the trading floor, chief trader <PERSON>Roger Streeter</PERSON> and two colleagues scrambled for the telephones as soon as the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> market opened -- plummeting more than 60 points in the first few minutes.
As Wall Street traders dumped American Depositary Receipts in <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar PLC</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Streeter</PERSON> and trader <PERSON>Sam Ruiz</PERSON> bought them to resell in the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> Investors here still expect <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to bid for <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>. 
Suddenly, after about 45 minutes, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> markets rallied. "The <ORGANIZATION>MMI</ORGANIZATION> has gone better," shouted one trader at about 3:15 <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> time, as the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Major Markets Index contract suddenly indicated a turnabout. 
Then, nine minutes later, Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day. "Rally! Rally! Rally!" shouted <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> trader <PERSON>Andy Rosen</PERSON>, selling more <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shares. "This is panic buying!" 
A <ORGANIZATION>House-Senate</ORGANIZATION> conference approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline routes within the continental <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and on all flights of six hours or less to <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. 
The exemption allowed on longer flights to <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> appears to be largely a face-saving concession for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry, which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent years. 
By a 6-4 margin, <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> negotiators initially rejected last night a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> provision covering all domestic flights.
As a practical matter, flights from the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> would be covered as they are under the time limit, but the language would exempt longer routes beginning, for example, in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> or on the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION>. 
Within the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, the ban has had aggressive support from <PERSON>Sen. Frank Lautenberg</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>), who has used his position as a <ORGANIZATION>Senate Appropriations</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee chairman to garner votes for the initiative.
The measure is attached to the more than $26 billion fiscal 1990 transportation bill within <PERSON>Mr. Lautenberg</PERSON>'s jurisdiction, and the final compromise is laced with more than $205 million in road projects earmarked by members as well as funds sought by major airports, including <PERSON>Denver</PERSON>. 
But the industry retains support in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> leadership through the influence of grower states, such as <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>.
Majority Whip <PERSON>William Gray</PERSON> owes a political debt to Southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, and the <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> Democrat used his position in the conference to salvage the exemption from a total ban. 
In a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations committees, the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by lawmakers in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> who had voted against the panel leadership on the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> floor. "Anybody can vote as they want," said Rep. <PERSON>William Lehman</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>), head of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> conferees. "But if you make a request, you should support the committee." 
The facilities account includes $40 million for <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>'s ambitious new airport, and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban lawmakers representing established airports in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and the major carriers to <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>United and Continental</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION>Air Transport Association</ORGANIZATION> were prominent in the lobbying.
An <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> journalist now is standing trial in <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>.
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> journalist's "crime" was writing that the head of the commission charged with overseeing the election's fairness, <PERSON>Bryan O'Linn</PERSON>, was openly sympathetic to <ORGANIZATION>SWAPO</ORGANIZATION>. Shortly after that, <PERSON>Mr. O'Linn</PERSON> had <PERSON>Scott Stanley</PERSON> arrested and his passport confiscated.
The <ORGANIZATION>Stanley</ORGANIZATION> affair doesn't bode well for the future of democracy or freedom of anything in <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> when <ORGANIZATION>SWAPO</ORGANIZATION> starts running the government.
To the extent <PERSON>Mr. Stanley</PERSON> has done anything wrong, it may be that he is out of step with the consensus of world intellectuals that the Namibian guerrillas were above all else the victims of suppression by neighboring <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>SWAPO</ORGANIZATION> has enjoyed favorable Western media treatment ever since the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> declared it the "sole, authentic representative" of <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>'s people in 
Last year, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> brokered a peace settlement to remove <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>'s "Afrika Korps" from <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> and hold "free and fair" elections that would end <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s control of <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>.
In July, <PERSON>Mr. Stanley</PERSON>, editor of <ORGANIZATION>American Press International</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> D.C.-based conservative wire service, visited <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> to report on the U.N.-monitored election campaign.
He interviewed <PERSON>Mr. O'Linn</PERSON>, head of a commission charged with investigating electoral intimidation, and reported that <PERSON>Mr. O'Linn</PERSON> was openly sympathetic to <ORGANIZATION>SWAPO</ORGANIZATION> and indeed had defended its leaders in court.
After <PERSON>Mr. Stanley</PERSON>'s article was published in two Namibian newspapers, <PERSON>Mr. O'Linn</PERSON> had criminal charges brought against their editors, publisher and lawyer.
<PERSON>Mr. Stanley</PERSON> was arrested and charged along with the others when he returned to <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> this month. 
Both the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Lawyers Committee for Freedom of the Press</ORGANIZATION> have protested <PERSON>Mr. Stanley</PERSON>'s detention.
<PERSON>Mr. Stanley</PERSON>'s arrest is the latest in a series of incidents that threaten to derail <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>'s elections.
State and the human-rights community should insist that <PERSON>Mr. Stanley</PERSON> and his fellow defendants be released and that the <ORGANIZATION>United Nation</ORGANIZATION>'s monitors make certain that <PERSON>Mr. O'Linn</PERSON>'s commission investigates election complaints from all sides. 
Lots of other entries made up the parade, of course -- notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices, signalling <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> tightness; and the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration's (temporary?) defeat in trying to lower the capital-gains tax.
<ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> opened Monday at $80, down nearly 20% from Thursday's close. (Both took further hits yesterday.) <ORGANIZATION>Hilton</ORGANIZATION> lost 20% on Friday; <ORGANIZATION>Paramount</ORGANIZATION> lost almost 11%.
The growing financial difficulties of recent high-leverage restructurings or takeovers, such as Resorts International, <ORGANIZATION>Integrated Resources</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Campeau</PERSON>'s retailing empire, have cast a pall over the entire market for high-yield securities.
Investors have reacted by ignoring recent efforts to float junk bonds by <PERSON>Ohio Mattress</PERSON> and by forcing <ORGANIZATION>Ramada</ORGANIZATION> to postpone indefinitely its planned junk-bond sale and restructuring.
<PERSON>Mr. Jarrell</PERSON>, former top economist at the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>, teaches at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Rochester</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Simon Business School</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's net income dropped 37%, while <ORGANIZATION>Bear Stearns Cos.</ORGANIZATION> posted a 7.5% gain in net, and <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's profit fell, but would have risen without a special gain a year ago. 
<PERSON>Bear Stearns</PERSON> is the holding company for <ORGANIZATION>Bear, Stearns & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the investment banking and brokerage firm. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Bear Stearns</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at $13.625, down 25 cents. 
A year ago, net at the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investment banking firm was $20.9 million, or 50 cents a share, including a special pretax gain of $46.3 million from the sale of the company's interest in <ORGANIZATION>National Car Rental Systems Inc</ORGANIZATION>. Revenue was $444.9 million, including net interest, down slightly from $450.7 million. 
In <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION> closed at $18.50, up 75 cents. 
Futures on the <ORGANIZATION>MMI</ORGANIZATION> are traded on the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Board of Trade</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>J.P. Morgan & Co.</ORGANIZATION> swung to a loss in the third quarter, while <ORGANIZATION>NCNB Corp.</ORGANIZATION> reported net income more than doubled, and <ORGANIZATION>Security Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> net rose 10%. 
<ORGANIZATION>J.P. Morgan</ORGANIZATION>, as expected, posted a $1.82 billion net loss for the quarter, reflecting the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> bank's decision last month to add $2 billion to reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries. 
The reserve addition placed the parent of <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION> among a few major <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> banks that have covered nearly all their medium and long-term portfolios to less-developed countries with reserves. 
<PERSON>George M. Salem</PERSON>, analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, called the results "mildly disappointing." Excluding the $2 billion provision and allowing for the taxes <ORGANIZATION>Morgan</ORGANIZATION> paid, earnings were about 65 cents a share, <PERSON>Mr. Salem</PERSON> said. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Morgan</ORGANIZATION> climbed $1.50 a share to $44.125. 
<ORGANIZATION>Morgan</ORGANIZATION> received $2 million of interest payments on its medium and long-term Brazilian loans; had they been accruing interest, net interest income would have been $35 million higher in the quarter, <ORGANIZATION>Morgan</ORGANIZATION> said.
<ORGANIZATION>NCNB Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's net income more than doubled in the period, largely because of continued strong performance by the bank's <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> operations. 
The <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, company said earnings rose to $143.6 million, or $1.45 a share, from $58.9 million, or 69 cents a share, a year earlier.
The latest quarter included a gain of $56.1 million, or 59 cents a share, related to the purchase of the remaining 51% of <ORGANIZATION>NCNB Texas National Bank</ORGANIZATION> from the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
The strong performance, however, contrasted with an unexpectedly large increase in the size of <ORGANIZATION>NCNB</ORGANIZATION>'s problem loans, particularly in the <LOCATION>Southeast</LOCATION>.
The higher rates paid on deposits also helped squeeze <ORGANIZATION>NCNB</ORGANIZATION>'s net interest margin in the <LOCATION>Southeast</LOCATION> to 3.38% from 3.80% a year earlier. 
In <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>NCNB</ORGANIZATION> jumped $3.50 a share, to $51.
<ORGANIZATION>NCNB Texas National</ORGANIZATION>, formed from the remnants of of the failed <ORGANIZATION>First RepublicBank Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, contributed $76.9 million to <ORGANIZATION>NCNB</ORGANIZATION>'s bottom line in the third quarter.
<ORGANIZATION>NCNB</ORGANIZATION> said its third-quarter results reflect 100% of earnings of the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> operation since Aug. 1. 
<ORGANIZATION>NCNB</ORGANIZATION> raised some $1.9 billion in new capital during the quarter to complete the <ORGANIZATION>NCNB Texas</ORGANIZATION> purchase, and to acquire several small failed thrifts to fill out its regional franchise.
Last week, the banking company said it purchased both <ORGANIZATION>Freedom Savings & Loan Association</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>University Federal Savings Association of San Antonio</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, for $169.4 million. 
<ORGANIZATION>Security Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s earnings growth slowed in the third quarter, but the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> bank holding company was still able to post a 10% increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real-estate and consumer loans. 
As a result, <ORGANIZATION>Security Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s net interest margin fell only 13 basis points, a more mild decrease than some major banks outside <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, which have been reporting more sluggish earnings. 
<ORGANIZATION>Security Pacific</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at $44.625, down 37.5 cents, in <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> composite trading. 
<ORGANIZATION>Whirlpool Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Benton Harbor</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, said it has developed a process to recover environmentally harmful chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, that previously entered the atmosphere during in-home repair of refrigerators and freezers. 
<ORGANIZATION>Whirpool</ORGANIZATION> said, "We see this process as a small but important step toward eventual elimination of <ORGANIZATION>CFC</ORGANIZATION> use in appliance manufacture." 
<PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> withdrew his $7.54 billion offer for <ORGANIZATION>American Air</ORGANIZATION>, citing the "recent change in market conditions." <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> slid $22.125, to $76.50.
Budget director <PERSON>Darman</PERSON> said he won't give federal agencies much leeway in coping with <PERSON>Gramm-Rudman</PERSON> spending cuts, which took effect yesterday.
<PERSON>Darman</PERSON> hopes to prod <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to finish a deficit plan. 
<ORGANIZATION>Bear Stearns</ORGANIZATION> posted a 7.5% gain, while <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION> had a decline due to a year-ago gain. 
The bill, whose backers include Chairman <PERSON>Dan Rostenkowski</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>), would prevent the <ORGANIZATION>Resolution Trust Corp.</ORGANIZATION> from raising temporary working capital by having an RTC-owned bank or thrift issue debt that wouldn't be counted on the federal budget.
The bill intends to restrict the <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> borrowings only, unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization. 
"Such agency `self-help' borrowing is unauthorized and expensive, far more expensive than direct <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> borrowing," said Rep. <PERSON>Fortney Stark</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>), the bill's chief sponsor. 
"It's a problem that clearly has to be resolved," said <PERSON>David Cooke</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION>.
The law does allow the <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION> to borrow from the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> up to $5 billion at any time.
Moreover, it says the <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION>'s total obligations may not exceed $50 billion, but that figure is derived after including notes and other debt, and subtracting from it the market value of the assets the <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION> holds. 
But <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> didn't anticipate or intend more public debt, say opponents of the <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION>'s working-capital plan, and Rep. <PERSON>Charles Schumer</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>) said the <ORGANIZATION>RTC Oversight Board</ORGANIZATION> has been remiss in not keeping <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> informed. 
"That secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from Ways and Means, which seems to me sort of draconian," he said. "The <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION> is going to have to pay a price of prior consultation on the <LOCATION>Hill</LOCATION> if they want that kind of flexibility." 
If all the bondholders and holders of one million common shares accept the offer, <ORGANIZATION>BSN</ORGANIZATION> will increase its debt by $9 million, but it also will recognize a $2 million gain from retiring the old debt, said <PERSON>Michael J. Blumenfeld</PERSON>, president. "We have sufficient cash flow to handle that," he said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Memotec Data Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it signed a definitive merger agreement with <ORGANIZATION>ISI Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION> under which <ORGANIZATION>Memotec</ORGANIZATION> will acquire <ORGANIZATION>ISI</ORGANIZATION> for $20 (<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>) a share, or about $130 million, in cash and securities. 
In <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>ISI</ORGANIZATION> closed up $3.125 at $18.625.
In <ORGANIZATION>Montreal Exchange</ORGANIZATION> trading, <ORGANIZATION>Memotec</ORGANIZATION> closed unchanged at 10.625 Canadian dollars (US$9.05). 
<ORGANIZATION>Memotec</ORGANIZATION> said under the agreement, <ORGANIZATION>ISI</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Braintree</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, provider of computer software and services to the insurance industry, will merge with a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION>Memotec</ORGANIZATION> created for that purpose.
<ORGANIZATION>Memotec</ORGANIZATION> said the agreement calls for it to make a $20-a-share cash tender offer for all shares outstanding of <ORGANIZATION>ISI</ORGANIZATION>.
But it said <PERSON>Charles Johnston</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>ISI</ORGANIZATION> chairman and president, agreed to sell his 60% stake in <ORGANIZATION>ISI</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Memotec</ORGANIZATION> upon completion of the tender offer for a combination of cash, <ORGANIZATION>Memotec</ORGANIZATION> stock and debentures.
<ORGANIZATION>Memotec</ORGANIZATION> said the tender offer is conditioned on, among other things, holders tendering at least 15% of the shares outstanding, other than the shares held by <PERSON>Mr. Johnston</PERSON>. 
<ORGANIZATION>ISI</ORGANIZATION> said it can withdraw from the merger agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Memotec</ORGANIZATION> if a better bid surfaces. 
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Banknote Co.</ORGANIZATION> said it again extended the expiration date of its $7-a-share tender offer for <ORGANIZATION>International Banknote Co.</ORGANIZATION> to Nov. 15. 
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Banknote</ORGANIZATION> said it believes the sale, if completed, apparently would satisfy antitrust issues raised by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> about <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Banknote</ORGANIZATION>'s offer to buy <ORGANIZATION>International Banknote</ORGANIZATION>.
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <PERSON>Banknote</PERSON> said "there can be no assurance" a sale agreement would be concluded.
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Banknote</ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION> extended the expiration date of its commitment for senior secured financing to Nov. 15. 
Closely held <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Banknote</ORGANIZATION> offered the $7 a share, or $126 million, for as many as 14.9 million shares, or 78.6%, of <ORGANIZATION>International Banknote</ORGANIZATION>'s shares outstanding.
<ORGANIZATION>BancOklahoma Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it completed a restructuring agreement previously agreed to by the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, creditor banks and subordinated debenture holders. 
The <ORGANIZATION>FDIC</ORGANIZATION>, which in 1986 provided $130 million in open-bank assistance to <ORGANIZATION>BancOklahoma's Bank of Oklahoma</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Tulsa</LOCATION>, unit will continue to maintain $90 million in preferred stock in the <LOCATION>Tulsa</LOCATION> bank unit.
In exchange for the other $40 million, the <ORGANIZATION>FDIC</ORGANIZATION> will receive additional warrants entitling it to buy 60% of <ORGANIZATION>BancOklahoma</ORGANIZATION>'s common stock outstanding, up from the 55% option the <ORGANIZATION>FDIC</ORGANIZATION> received under terms of the 1986 capital infusion. 
In addition, <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Alan Greenspan</PERSON> attempted to calm the markets by denying reports he was publicly feuding with the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>. 
"I view this morning's action as hand holding for the financial markets," said <PERSON>Steven Wood</PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION>Bank of America</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Greenspan</PERSON> appeared in public briefly yesterday morning to deliver a speech to the <ORGANIZATION>American Bankers Association</ORGANIZATION> convention here.
In a brief comment before the speech, he said he was "surprised" that some people interpreted his recent comments in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> "as endeavoring to say something about current monetary or foreign exchange policies." While visiting <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> last week, the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> chairman had warned that "attempts to maintain unrealistic exchange rates" may be destabilizing -- a comment some interpreted as criticism of the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to push down the dollar. 
"I hope my colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION>Gosbank</ORGANIZATION> {the Soviet central bank} don't misinterpret anything I said today," the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> chairman joked before beginning the prepared text of his speech. 
<PERSON>Mr. Greenspan</PERSON> also tried to reassure the markets by saying that "we at the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> are watching the financial markets rather closely." He said the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> was coordinating its activities with foreign officials, and that "coordination exists at a detailed level here in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> among the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>CFTC</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>." 
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration officials were pleased with the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>'s action, and shared <PERSON>Mr. Greenspan</PERSON>'s view that there was close coordination among the various government agencies. 
On Sunday, for instance, <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Nicholas Brady</PERSON> held a lengthy meeting with <PERSON>Mr. Greenspan</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Richard Breeden</PERSON> to evaluate information on Friday's market plunge.
The administration also benefited from the expertise of <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON>Robert Glauber</PERSON> and Assistant Secretary <PERSON>David Mullins</PERSON>, two former <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> professors who had headed up the <ORGANIZATION>Brady Commission</ORGANIZATION>'s effort to investigate the 1987 crash.
Some analysts have said disagreements between the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> added to an environment that allowed Friday's steep market decline to occur.
For weeks prior to the market's drop, the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> had been urging the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> to bring down short-term interest rates, and the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> had been resisting.
Also, <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> Vice Chairman <PERSON>Manuel Johnson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Wayne Angell</PERSON>, another member of the reserve board, had objected, in a vote made public Oct. 6, to the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to push down the dollar by selling currency in foreign exchange markets. 
<PERSON>Mr. Greenspan</PERSON> was also known to be privately unenthusiastic about the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>'s orders for massive dollar sales.
Separately, <PERSON>David Ruder</PERSON>, who left the chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> two weeks ago, says investors should view market volatility as a fact of modern market life. 
<PERSON>Mr. Ruder</PERSON>, now a professor at the <ORGANIZATION>Northwestern University School of Law</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, also expressed concern about two pauses in the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION> futures pits after prices had fallen and circuit breakers kicked in.
Noting that the <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION> industrials continued to fall as the futures were spared further carnage, <PERSON>Mr. Ruder</PERSON> said, "I think that's something that needs to be looked at very carefully." 
The buy-out of <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> by a group made up of management, the pilots union and <ORGANIZATION>British Airways PLC</ORGANIZATION>, ran into difficulty because of its own unique problems, they say.
The airline's top two officers, chief executive <PERSON>Stephen M. Wolf</PERSON> and chief financial officer <PERSON>John C. Pope</PERSON>, for example, would have made a total of more than $100 million on the buy-out through stock options they hold, even though their proposal called for them to put only $15 million of their own funds into the deal. 
Even so, banks such as <ORGANIZATION>First Chicago</ORGANIZATION>, which has a long history of ties to <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>, stretched their lending guidelines as far as possible in hopes of making the proposal work. "We really gave this thing nine looks," the <ORGANIZATION>First Chicago</ORGANIZATION> officer said. 
It was the job of <PERSON>A.D. Frazier</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>First Chicago</ORGANIZATION>'s commercial lending chief, to call the buy-out group and put the best possible face on the news. "We called them back and said if they needed us -- if it would make a difference -- we'd come in," another officer familiar with the matter said. 
Other <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> banks and, more importantly, those in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, also said no.
In the end, the proposal never got far beyond the original financing promises made by <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Chase Manhattan Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which together had agreed to commit $3 billion and said they were "highly confident" they could raise an additional $4.2 billion. 
"We've got a lot of homework to do, a lot of work ahead of us," said <PERSON>H. Bruce Bernstein</PERSON>, a lawyer at <ORGANIZATION>Sidley & Austin</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, which is representing the bank group. 
At 3:30, with the market now in a free fall, representatives of the buy-out group scrambled to a hastily called meeting at <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>'s offices at 399 Park Avenue in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
The meeting itself, held in the corporate finance department on the ninth floor, was disorganized, as members of <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>'s and <PERSON>Chase</PERSON>'s syndication departments called other banks trying to figure out why they had rejected the deal.
One person who wasn't present: <PERSON>Mr. Wolf</PERSON> himself who, confident that the deal would go through, was returning from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, where he had pitched the proposal to several big <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> banks. 
<PERSON>Mr. Wolf</PERSON>, reached at his <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> home Saturday, declined to comment. 
Although they had provided the lion's share of the financing on the <ORGANIZATION>Northwest Airlines</ORGANIZATION> buy-out just a few months before, Japanese banks had said no to <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>. 
A senior executive at one of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s biggest banks says the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> deal "was stretched.
Japanese lenders also recently have grown more conservative toward highly leveraged transactions, partly because of the recent cash-squeeze at <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Campeau Corp.</ORGANIZATION> following its leveraged purchase of <ORGANIZATION>Federated Department Stores Inc.</ORGANIZATION> last year.
On Thursday, at their national convention in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, machinists union leaders discussed launching an allout campaign against <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Wolf</PERSON> specifically.
Machinists union leader <PERSON>John Peterpaul</PERSON> also made the union's views known in telephone conversations with representatives of <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Bank</ORGANIZATION>, one of the Japanese banks that was considering participating in the financing.
Among other things, the bank feared "we'd look like dogs" if <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> was able to piece together the financing and <ORGANIZATION>First Chicago</ORGANIZATION> was absent, a top lending officer said.
<ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Pope</PERSON> was warning that just that could happen. "<PERSON>Pope</PERSON> told us there's no question the banks are going to sign up." 
According to a machinists union analysis of the transaction that will be presented to the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Transportation</ORGANIZATION> and a <ORGANIZATION>House Aviation</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee later this week, a "mild recession" would result in the company's taking in $3.5 billion less cash in the next four years than forecast by the buy-out group. 
<PERSON>Wolf</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pope</PERSON>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Chase</PERSON> told the buy-out group they were "highly confident" they could raise the remaining $4.2 billion needed to finance the deal. (The $7.2 billion the banks said they needed includes some refinancing of existing debt, and is therefore greater than the $6.79 billion offered for <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>.) <ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION>'s confidence was bolstered as recently as 10 days ago when representatives of 120 banks that had expressed interest in the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> transaction attended a meeting with <ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION> representatives. "Ninety percent of the questions asked were friendly," said a person who attended. "There were a lot of indications both before and after that this was a deal people thought well of." 
The recent buy-out financing of <ORGANIZATION>NWA</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Northwest Airlines</ORGANIZATION>' parent, for instance, was a much more collaborative effort among several <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> banks.
"Perhaps lenders are finally recognizing that the stream of airline cash flow may be less predictable and a higher risk than previously considered," said <PERSON>Karen Firestone</PERSON>, a money manager at <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Investments</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Ms. Firestone</PERSON> added, "In the same week that <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> announces they might lose money in the quarter, <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> is trying to get money for a $300-a-share buy-out.
Because the junk bond market has ground to a halt since <ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION>'s problems were made manifest, so-called bridge loans from Wall Street firms or other sources could be used for subordinated debt in the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> deal.

But when the tender offer was increased, <ORGANIZATION>Lucky</ORGANIZATION>'s directors approved the merger and, in June 1988, <ORGANIZATION>American Stores</ORGANIZATION>' $2.5 billion purchase of <ORGANIZATION>Lucky Stores</ORGANIZATION> was completed. 
The <ORGANIZATION>FTC</ORGANIZATION> reviewed the merger and, in August 1988, approved a settlement between the <ORGANIZATION>FTC</ORGANIZATION> staff and <ORGANIZATION>American Stores</ORGANIZATION>.

In an attempt to give new momentum to <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> plans for a single currency, <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> government leaders are likely to agree to set a date for starting formal talks on amending the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>'s founding Treaty of <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>. 
According to diplomatic sources in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>, most <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> leaders agree that talks should begin in the second half of 1990, and will make a declaration on that during a summit meeting in <LOCATION>Strasbourg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, on Dec. 8 and 9. 
The only strong opposition to changing the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> treaty comes from <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON>, who is opposed to creating a single EC currency.
French President <PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON> fought to set a date for the conference during the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> last June, but the move was scuttled because of opposition by <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> and West German Chancellor <PERSON>Helmut Kohl</PERSON>.

The "social dimension" -- worker concerns -- of the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>'s plan to open its internal borders in 1992 could set the effort "off the rails" if not done reasonably, says <ORGANIZATION>General Electric</ORGANIZATION> senior vice president <PERSON>Frank Doyle</PERSON>.
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies wanting to expand in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> face "tough pressure" from unions in nations such as <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, which play a big consulting role in management decisions, he says.

Many employers have already begun moving to southern countries such as <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, where wages are low and unions are weaker; demand for trained labor and managers will rise there, <ORGANIZATION>FMC</ORGANIZATION> says. 
<PERSON>Pfizer</PERSON>, <PERSON>Fluor</PERSON> and GE see big "EC 92" pluses: a push for job training and ease in moving and finding workers. 
So said a federal judge, in a case involving two players for the minor league <ORGANIZATION>Bluefield</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Orioles</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> farm team.
SPRUCING UP THE DIGS: About 200 employees of the <ORGANIZATION>Maryland Department of Economic and Employment Development</ORGANIZATION> for four months painted walls, polished and carpeted floors, bought plants, cleaned windows and blinds, and hung pictures at the agency's <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> office.
<ORGANIZATION>Federal Express</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Dow Chemical</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>National City Corp.</ORGANIZATION> will buy the home or let the worker sell to an outside firm, but usually won't cover a loss. 
THE CHECKOFF: The <ORGANIZATION>National Academy of Engineering</ORGANIZATION> gives two inventors of the semiconductor microchip a $350,000 achievement award. . . . Now, that's reactionary: <ORGANIZATION>Letter Carriers</ORGANIZATION> union president Vincent Sombrotto accuses <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> postmaster <PERSON>Charles James</PERSON> of "12th century . . . oppressive management tactics." 
"It's scaring the hell out of me," says <PERSON>Tom Loughlin</PERSON>, a systems analyst and small investor in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>. 
-- The levels of selling of <LOCATION>U.S</LOCATION> and foreign stocks in <LOCATION>Asian</LOCATION> and European markets, which open well before <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s.
-- Whether the buy-out of <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, whose financing failure triggered Friday's free fall, can be put back together.
The lower <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> opens, the more traders who've bought with borrowed money will have to sell <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> and other takeover stocks to meet margin calls. 
When the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> buy-out group said it couldn't get bank financing for its $6.79 billion deal, the announcement sent takeover-stock traders scrambling to sell <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION>, other airline stocks and then other real or rumored takeover stocks. 
<ORGANIZATION>The Standard & Poor</ORGANIZATION>'s 500-stock index futures took only 15 minutes from the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> announcement, at 2:54 p.m., to hit their first "circuit breaker," a 30-minute trading halt that kicks in when the futures drop the equivalent of 100 points on the Dow.
Had the <ORGANIZATION>Dow</ORGANIZATION> fallen 250 points, trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> would have been halted for an hour. 
But <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>John J. Phelan Jr.</PERSON> maintains that the safeguards were a success Friday. 
One futures executive, <PERSON>Christopher Pedersen</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Twenty-First Securities Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, says the specialists "were not able to handle the imbalances on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>." But <PERSON>James Maguire</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Henderson Brothers Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> specialist, retorts: "It is easy to say the specialist isn't doing his job.
Market professionals say that major arbitragers and others such as hedge funds, which were heavily invested in <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> and highly leveraged, couldn't get any cash out of their <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> positions because trading halted.
So such traders quickly tried to raise cash by selling other so-called deal stocks, like <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION>) and <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION>, subject of a $120-a-share bid from <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>, saw trading in its stock halted at $98.625 a share, down $.125, but was quoted in off-exchange trading at only $81.50.
The deluge left some investors shaken and angry. "Don't ask me how I am," said <PERSON>Marshall Front</PERSON>, a money manager at <ORGANIZATION>Stein Roe & Farnham Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. "This is incredible.
<PERSON>Frederick A. Moran</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Moran Asset Management</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Greenwich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, said computer-aided "program traders are the reason we had the last crash, they're the reason we're having this crash, and they're why we'll have the next crash.
They're a total outrage." <PERSON>Stephen B. Timbers</PERSON>, chief investment officer of <ORGANIZATION>Kemper Financial Services Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, agrees that none of Friday's events by themselves added up to a 190-point decline. "Programs took it down.
Traders say that Friday's big sellers included <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which was reportedly executing trades for a client switching from stocks to bonds, and <ORGANIZATION>Tudor Investments</ORGANIZATION>, a prominent player in the futures markets.
<PERSON>Michael Steinhardt</PERSON>, who only last Monday was threatening a takeover of <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> using his 8.4% stake as a club, says he wished he didn't own the stock when Friday's market left him with a $12.9 million paper loss. "This market is a mile wide and an inch deep," he says.
But <PERSON>Mr. Steinhardt</PERSON> disputed that he had been a heavy seller of other stocks Friday to make up for the <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION> losses. 
In 1987, then-Treasury Secretary <PERSON>James Baker</PERSON> was threatening a big drop in the dollar if <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> raised interest rates.
This year, <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Alan Greenspan</PERSON> seemed to warn he wouldn't lower interest rates merely to keep the dollar within an agreed-on exchange range. 
Then it was <ORGANIZATION>House Budget Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Daniel Rostenkowski</PERSON> threatening to eliminate the tax deductibility of interest for certain debt-financed takeovers.
This year it was <ORGANIZATION>Transportation</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Samuel Skinner</PERSON> voicing concern about airline buy-outs and threatening to force changes in the <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> deal. (Some think another <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> factor this time was the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>'s failure to pass capital-gains tax cut.) 
Takeover specialist <PERSON>Carl Icahn</PERSON>, whose 13.1% stake in <ORGANIZATION>USX Corp.</ORGANIZATION> lost $151.2 million in value on Friday, says the stock market's downturn may reflect the end of a speculative period that has generated many leveraged buy-outs that now face problems as a result of weakness in the junk-bond market. "While a number of LBOs are fine, there are also many where the cash flow cannot pay the interest, but {that} instead are based on the buyer selling divisions to a greater fool to pay off the debt," <PERSON>Mr. Icahn</PERSON> says. 
As on any day on Wall Street, there are plenty of people who think the market will go up, and plenty who predict a downturn. "My advice is to buy," says <PERSON>Elaine Garzarelli</PERSON>, a market-timing expert at <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, who warned clients of danger just before the 1987 crash.
<PERSON>James Awad</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>BMI Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, says that despite the more favorable valuation levels, stocks could still tumble several hundred points in the event of a breakdown in "the internal structure of the market." 
<ORGANIZATION>Fidelity</ORGANIZATION>, which was forced to sell $800 million of stocks in the 1987 crash, has quadrupled the cash level of the giant <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> fund.
"Two years ago there were massive redemption levels over the weekend and a lot of fear around," says <PERSON>C. Bruce Johnstone</PERSON>, who runs <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity</ORGANIZATION>'s $5 billion Equity-Income Fund. "This feels more like a one-shot deal -- people aren't panicking." 
Over the weekend, <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Greenspan</PERSON> phoned officials in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and abroad to reassure them that the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system if needed to prevent a financial crisis.
And <PERSON>Mr. Phelan</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, says that the exchange hasn't turned up any capital problems among its 49 specialist firms, suggesting that the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> will have the capacity to make orderly markets even if volume is heavy. 
<ORGANIZATION>BSN S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, a leading French food group, said it agreed to acquire <PERSON>Birkel</PERSON> G.m.b.
<ORGANIZATION>BSN</ORGANIZATION> will initially acquire a 15% interest in <LOCATION>Birkel</LOCATION>, a closely held concern.
<LOCATION>Birkel</LOCATION> is <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>'s second-biggest producer of pasta, with sales of 250 million marks ($133.4 million) in 1988.
The French group currently ranks second after <ORGANIZATION>Barilla Group</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, whose sales are chiefly in the Italian market. 
Nevertheless, lobbies such as the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Home Builders</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>NAHB</ORGANIZATION>) continue to pressure <LOCATION>Capitol Hill</LOCATION> for more special-interest spending. 
<PERSON>Kent Colton</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>NAHB</ORGANIZATION> executive vice president, argues that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> faces a multifaceted housing crisis -- reduced affordability of homes for first-time buyers, increased homelessness, and lower apartment construction rates -- that will be "very difficult" to solve "without expanded federal resources." 
But the <ORGANIZATION>NAHB</ORGANIZATION> was created in 1943 out of an organization that made its name fighting a <ORGANIZATION>Roosevelt</ORGANIZATION> administration proposal to take over all defense housing production.
"The <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> budget has dropped by more than 70% since 1980," argues <PERSON>Mr. Colton</PERSON>. "We've taken more than our fair share.
But <ORGANIZATION>NAHB</ORGANIZATION> support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch; over the years the <ORGANIZATION>NAHB</ORGANIZATION> has backed a host of public programs.
Moreover, explains one <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> official, the <ORGANIZATION>NAHB</ORGANIZATION> remains susceptible to internal pressure from members that specialize in subsidized production. 
It would like to peg the ceiling on <ORGANIZATION>Federal Housing Administration</ORGANIZATION> mortgage guarantees to 95% of the median price in a particular market, instead of limiting it to $101,250; reduce (or even eliminate) <ORGANIZATION>FHA</ORGANIZATION> down-payment requirements and increase the availability of variable-rate mortgages; expand the <ORGANIZATION>Veterans Affairs Department</ORGANIZATION> loan guarantee program; provide "adequate" funding for the <ORGANIZATION>Farmers Home Administration</ORGANIZATION> (FmHA); increase federal funding and tax incentives for the construction of low-income and rental housing, including $4 billion in block grants to states and localities; and "fully fund" the McKinney Act, a $656 million potpourri for the homeless. 
Though <PERSON>Mr. Colton</PERSON> says expanding <ORGANIZATION>FHA</ORGANIZATION> lending would result in "no cost to the government," the mere diversion of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing (such as low-income) to the single-family home market would result in a major expense.
More important, housing programs run by <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION>, and FmHA are awash in red ink.
The federal government has had to pump in $2.28 billion into the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> housing program since 1984 to keep the fund afloat and the <ORGANIZATION>VA</ORGANIZATION> requested an additional $120 million for the fiscal year just ended.
Explains <PERSON>Sheila MacDonald</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>National Taxpayers Union</ORGANIZATION>: "It treads in two worlds.
Two years ago when the <ORGANIZATION>NAHB</ORGANIZATION> lobbied for the $19 billion omnibus housing bill, the organization "basically dropped out of the taxpayers' coalition," says <PERSON>Ms. MacDonald</PERSON>.
As <PERSON>Mr. Colton</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>NAHB</ORGANIZATION> acknowledges: "Government is not going to solve the problem. . . . The real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down." More money for <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> will increase the deficit and destabilize the economy; more money to municipalities that are wrecking their local housing markets will further insulate them from the destructive effects of their policies.
<PERSON>Mr. Bandow</PERSON> is a <ORGANIZATION>Cato Institute</ORGANIZATION> fellow. 
At 1:30 p.m. <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> time, the <ORGANIZATION>Nikkei</ORGANIZATION> index of 225 selected stocks was off 1.4%, or 482.39 points, to 34633.63.
<PERSON>Yoshiro Inoue</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Nomura Securities Co.</ORGANIZATION>, described the steep decline in the beginning as "a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> shock." He predicted that "there would be no steep recovery but at the same time there would be no further decline." 
Said a Japanese equities trader at <ORGANIZATION>Jardine Flemings Securities Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>: "There is still a lot of weakness and nervousness in the market." 
The announcement that a group of takeover bidders for <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION> had failed to raise enough money to acquire the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> airline was one of the main factors that triggered the sell-off, analysts said. 
How far share prices fall in other markets will depend to a great extent on how the <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> market reacts, analysts and investors said. "I'm hoping <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> holds tight," said <PERSON>Allen Wheat</PERSON>, head of trading at <ORGANIZATION>Bankers Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, before the <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> opening. "But if <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> is wobbly, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> will probably take a beating." 
The French market could be harder hit than the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> market, European analysts said, because recent unmaterialized takeover speculation in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> has left some blue-chip stocks poised for markdowns. "<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> has had an awful lot of froth in the past two weeks and so is probably going to be hit a bit worse than <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>," said <PERSON>David Band</PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Barclays Bank PLC</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Barclays de Zoete Wedd</ORGANIZATION> investment banking unit. 
Analysts in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> had said over the weekend that a drop is unavoidable, but they predicted that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s traditionally cautious institutional investors will keep things from spinning out of control. "The <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> market can't help but go down," said <PERSON>Hiroaki Hanao</PERSON>, deputy general manager of the equity department at <ORGANIZATION>Daiwa Securities Co.</ORGANIZATION> "But it won't be such a big crash." 
The <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Finance</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Japan</ORGANIZATION> appear to be eager to put out the fire before it spreads.
Japanese newspapers reported Saturday that the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Finance</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Japan</ORGANIZATION> view the plunge on Wall Street as a result of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> domestic concerns about financing acquisitions, not as a sign of weak economic fundamentals. 
As Japanese investors prepare for some rough waters this week, they will be paying close attention to the foreign exchange markets. "<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> is most worried about the currency," said <ORGANIZATION>Daiwa Securities</ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON>Mr. Hanao</PERSON>.
The dollar opened in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> at 139.95, down 4.05 from last Friday's <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> finish. 
Then, many market watchers in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> worried that the highly speculative <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> market would be the one to send world markets reeling.
Many Japanese funds, which closed their books at the end of September, now have huge cash positions. "There's still lots of idle money sitting around here," said <PERSON>Hiroshi Ohira</PERSON>, chief analyst at <ORGANIZATION>New Japan Securities Co.</ORGANIZATION>, citing a frequently stated reason for <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s strength. 
Whatever happens in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, the powerful ripple effects are sure to be felt first in other <LOCATION>Asian</LOCATION> markets.
A severe drop in <LOCATION>Japanese</LOCATION> stock prices or a steep fall in the dollar would exacerbate price declines in smaller markets such as <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>, money managers say. 
In late May and early June, when political turmoil overwhelmed <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, the Hang Seng index plummeted 37% to 2093. (<LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> reverts to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> in 1997.) Since then, international fund managers decreased their exposure to the market and only recently have begun to tiptoe back in. 
"It's not like �the crash in� October 1987, when there was lots of optimism," said <PERSON>Phillip Niem</PERSON>, research director in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> for British-based <ORGANIZATION>Hoare Govette Asia Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> "This time around there's lots of caution.
Later that day Black Monday unfolded in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, and officials closed the <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> exchange for four days, a move that shook investor confidence in the market.
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s stock market, already wheezing under stresses of its own, is also casting a nervous eye toward <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> and bracing for a shock. 
Many <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> traders planned an allnight vigil on developments in the <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> market. "A lot of our guys will be sitting up all night at home, and a couple of our guys will be in the office overnight," said <PERSON>Mr. Wheat</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Bankers Trust</ORGANIZATION>. 
Authorities, including the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of England</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Securities Association</ORGANIZATION>, are gearing up in case a crisis wallops the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> market.
Said a spokesman: "There's no reason for such an exaggerated fall in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, where share values aren't underpinned in the same degree as <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> by highly leveraged situations." 
The <ORGANIZATION>Securities Association</ORGANIZATION>, which regulates <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s stock markets, said that if prices plunge today all dealers will be ordered to report their capital and market positions daily. "We're monitoring things very closely," a spokeswoman said. 
Even before Friday's <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> nosedive, the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> market had been facing heavy uncertainty because of worries over the <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> economy.
One person who firmly believes <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> is headed for trouble no matter what happens elsewhere is <PERSON>Peter Thompson</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr. Thompson</PERSON>, a consultant to <ORGANIZATION>Barclay de Zoete Wedd Securities Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, jolted the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> market last Monday by predicting that another bear market is at hand. 
"<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> will open lower {today} whether or not <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> opens lower," <PERSON>Mr. Thompson</PERSON> said in an interview. "Market makers will mark down prices so bears can't go short to them at too advantageous a price." By going short, a market pessimist sells borrowed shares in the hope of buying them back later at a profit. 
Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Hughes Aircraft Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said it agreed to purchase the <ORGANIZATION>Electro-Optics Technology</ORGANIZATION> division of <ORGANIZATION>Perkin-Elmer Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
Perkin-Elmer, which is based in <LOCATION>Norwalk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, said the sale of the <LOCATION>Danbury</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, unit is consistent with its restructuring strategy announced in April.
<ORGANIZATION>Hughes of Los Angeles</ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION>PerkinElmer</ORGANIZATION> unit's work complements efforts by its Electro-Optical and <ORGANIZATION>Data Systems</ORGANIZATION> group, which makes infrared sensors, military lasers and night vision equipment.
The manufacturer of ultrasound diagnostic systems, based in <LOCATION>Ambler</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, reported a nine-month net loss of $2.43 million compared with net income of $2.71 million, or 44 cents a share, for the nine-month period a year earlier. 
<ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which has offered to acquire the movie-production company, is seeking to free its top executives, <PERSON>Peter Guber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jon Peters</PERSON>, from an exclusive agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Warner Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION> so they can run <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> two weeks ago agreed to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> for $3.4 billion, or $27 a share.
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> sued <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Guber-Peters</ORGANIZATION> late last week; <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Guber-Peters</ORGANIZATION> have countersued, charging <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> with attempting to interfere in <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of the two companies. 
Our markets were closely tied to the stock market," said <PERSON>Joel Kazis</PERSON>, manager of trading at <ORGANIZATION>Smith Barney</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Harris Upham & Co.</ORGANIZATION> "Friday's flight to quality was no longer needed once the stock market found its legs," he said. 
Among the firms were <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
In particular, they said, firms such as <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION> began making a market in junk issues early in the session when prices hit severely depressed levels. 
"I think the willingness of securities companies to make markets for high-yield issues improved the sentiment for junk bonds," said <PERSON>John Lonski</PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bonds were higher in overnight trading in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, which opened at about 7:30 p.m. EDT.
Many <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trading operations, wanting to keep a watchful eye on Japanese trading as an indication of where <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trading would begin, were fully staffed during the <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> trading session. 
"Most of the action was during the night session," said <PERSON>Michael Moore</PERSON>, trading manager at <ORGANIZATION>Continental Bank</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Jay Goldinger</PERSON>, who often trades overnight for <ORGANIZATION>Capital Insight Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, said trading in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> was "very active" but highly volatile. "We went down 3/4 point in 10 minutes right before lunch, then after lunch we went up 3/4 point in 12 minutes," he said.
<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s market turned out to be a bad bellwether for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trading.
Late yesterday <ORGANIZATION>Ginnie Mae</ORGANIZATION> 9% securities were yielding 9.39% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> 10-year note narrowed 0.01 percentage point to 1.42. 
Traders said there were some busy dealings in <ORGANIZATION>Freddie Mac</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Federal National Mortgage Association</ORGANIZATION> securities because underwriters from last week's heavy slate of real estate mortgage investment conduit issues moved to gather collateral for new deals. 
The 7 1/8% issue of Triborough Bridge and <ORGANIZATION>Tunnel Authority</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, due 2019, was off 5/8 at 98 1/8 bid.
And <LOCATION>Fairfax County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Water Authority</ORGANIZATION>'s 7 1/4% issue of 2027 was down 3/4 at 99 7/8 bid. 
One analyst, <ORGANIZATION>Peter Cardillo of Josephthal & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said the gold market already had some good price-supporting technical factors that would have caused prices to rise, with or without the stock market. "What the stock market did was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened," said <PERSON>Mr. Cardillo</PERSON>.
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> benchmark crude, <LOCATION>West Texas</LOCATION> Intermediate, closed at $20.59 a barrel for November delivery, down 30 cents.
But the recovery in the stock market provided little help for copper as word spread that a three-month strike at the <LOCATION>Highland Valley</LOCATION> mine in <LOCATION>British Columbia</LOCATION> was about over, according to an analyst.
<LOCATION>Highland Valley</LOCATION> is a large Canadian producer and principal supplier to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, which recently began seeking copper elsewhere as its inventories shrank.
Copper inventories in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Commodity Exchange</ORGANIZATION> warehouses rose yesterday by 516 tons, to 10,004 tons.
The <ORGANIZATION>LME</ORGANIZATION> stocks decline was about as expected, but the <ORGANIZATION>Comex</ORGANIZATION> gain wasn't.
Technical considerations following the hurricane, which was a factor in the market Friday, caused prices to decline yesterday, said <PERSON>Ernest Simon</PERSON>, cotton specialist for <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
Prices rose sharply Friday as the storm approached <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, which is part of the <LOCATION>Mississippi Delta</LOCATION> cotton-growing area.
Colder weather is being predicted for the high plains of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and the northern states of the <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> during the coming weekend, <PERSON>Mr. Simon</PERSON> said.
Another analyst thought that <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> may have pulled back because of the concern over the stock market. "<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> may have felt that if there was a severe drop in the stock market and it affected sugar, it could buy at lower prices," said <PERSON>Judith Ganes</PERSON>, analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Frank Lloyd Wright</PERSON> is reported to have said once that if you tipped the world on its side, everything loose would end up in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
We've always thought that <PERSON>Mr. Wright</PERSON> underestimated <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s vitality, but maybe the state's la-la factions are starting to overwhelm the forces that made it such a significant place.
The initiative is based largely on the wish-lists of the green lobby: the <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Club</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>League of Conservation Voters</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Natural Resources Defense Council</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Toxics Campaign</ORGANIZATION> and the Citizens for a Better Environment.
<LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> wheat farmers and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> fruit growers would have to adjust or give up the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> market.
This initiative is being labeled The <ORGANIZATION>Big Green</ORGANIZATION>, but maybe it should be called The <ORGANIZATION>Big Greenback</ORGANIZATION>. (The <ORGANIZATION>Republican</ORGANIZATION> candidate, <PERSON>Sen. Pete Wilson</PERSON>, is playing the initiative fundraising game too, sponsoring his own crime initiative.) 
While it is possible that the <ORGANIZATION>Big Green</ORGANIZATION> initiative will be ruled unconstitutional, it is of course conceivable that in modern <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> it could slide through.
<PERSON>Mr. Van de Kamp</PERSON> and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and apple-pie issue among certain segments of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s population now that almost any collection of anti-scientific, anti-pocketbook nonsense can pass under its rubric.
<PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>, for example, may decide that he doesn't want to be the President who lost control of interstate commerce to an attorney general from <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
Congressman <PERSON>Lee Hamilton</PERSON>, an <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> Democrat who chairs the the <ORGANIZATION>Joint Economic Committee</ORGANIZATION>, plans hearings next week on his bill to subject the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> to greater political control.
Former Senator <PERSON>William Proxmire</PERSON> has called the <LOCATION>Hamilton</LOCATION> bill the most dangerous economic legislation now before <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, because it would give <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economic policy a further inflationary bias.
The <LOCATION>Hamilton</LOCATION> bill would put the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Secretary on the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>'s board and <ORGANIZATION>Open Market Committee</ORGANIZATION>, which charts monetary policy.
More worrisome, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> would have a stronger supervisory role, with the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> audited by the <ORGANIZATION>General Accounting Office</ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> runs. 
Both the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> traditionally have pushed for easy money, the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> to reduce its debt management problems and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to satisfy powerful producer constituencies who want a weak dollar for short-term competitive gains in world markets.
Even now, the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> cannot simply thumb its nose at the President and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economy took on an inflationary bias when the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> was forced to finance an incredible spending spree by <PERSON>Lyndon Johnson</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON> exacerbated the problem when, in response to pressures from <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, he applied price and wage controls in August 1971, thereby discouraging production.
<PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON> ultimately hired <PERSON>Mr. Volcker</PERSON> to kill inflation, which was reaching dangerous levels.
Rep. <PERSON>Stephen Neal</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>) wants <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to instruct the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> to do one thing: prevent inflation.
Meanwhile, as the first of more than 1,300 East Germans trying to flee to the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> through <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> renounced their citizenship, a West German newspaper reported that regional <ORGANIZATION>Communist</ORGANIZATION> officials demanded the dismissal of hard-line leader <PERSON>Honecker</PERSON>. 
Secretary of <ORGANIZATION>State Baker</ORGANIZATION>, in a foreign policy speech, called for the reunification of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, saying it was the "legitimate right" of the <LOCATION>German</LOCATION> people. 
<ORGANIZATION>House-Senate</ORGANIZATION> conferees approved a permanent smoking ban on domestic airline routes within the continental <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and on flights of less than six hours to <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>E. Robert Wallach</PERSON> was sentenced by a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> judge in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to six years in prison and fined $250,000 for his racketeering conviction in the <ORGANIZATION>Wedtech</ORGANIZATION> scandal.
<PERSON>Wallach</PERSON>, an associate of ex-Attorney General <PERSON>Meese</PERSON>, was found guilty in August of taking $425,000 in illegal payoffs from the now-defunct defense contractor. 
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> resumed the countdown for today's launch of the space shuttle <LOCATION>Atlantis</LOCATION>, and a federal appeals court in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> dismissed a lawsuit by anti-nuclear groups to delay the flight because the plutonium-powered <PERSON>Galileo</PERSON> space probe was aboard.
<PERSON>Mubarak</PERSON> held reconciliation talks with <PERSON>Gadhafi</PERSON> at the <LOCATION>Egyptian</LOCATION> resort of <ORGANIZATION>Mersa Metruh</ORGANIZATION>.
It was the <LOCATION>Libyan</LOCATION> leader's first trip to <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> in 16 years.

It also negotiated an arrangement with <ORGANIZATION>Cable News Network</ORGANIZATION> under which <ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION> would agree to air its last-minute creations. 
The new <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION> commercial, created with ad agency <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi & Saatchi Co.</ORGANIZATION>, features <PERSON>Mary Farrell</PERSON>, one of the firm's most visible investment strategists, sounding particularly bullish.
Taped just as the market closed yesterday, it offers <PERSON>Ms. Farrell</PERSON> advising, "We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle. . . . We continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long-term appreciation." The spot was scheduled to appear three times on <ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION> last night. 
"We're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything, which just drives the prices down further," says <PERSON>John Lampe</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION>'s director of advertising. "If you owned it and liked it Friday, the true value hasn't changed." He adds, "This isn't 1987 revisited." 
ARNOLD ADVERTISING: <PERSON>Edward Eskandarian</PERSON>, former chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Della Femina</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>McNamee WCRS/Boston</ORGANIZATION>, reached an agreement in principle to acquire a majority stake in <ORGANIZATION>Arnold Advertising</ORGANIZATION>, a small <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> shop.
<PERSON>Mr. Eskandarian</PERSON>, who resigned his <ORGANIZATION>Della Femina</ORGANIZATION> post in September, becomes chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Arnold</ORGANIZATION>.
Separately, <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Oak Brook</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, named <ORGANIZATION>Arnold</ORGANIZATION> to handle its estimated $4 million cooperative ad account for the <LOCATION>Hartford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, area.
That account had been handled by <ORGANIZATION>Della Femina</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>McNamee WCRS</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Allegheny Ludlum Corp.</ORGANIZATION> expects to report third-quarter net of about $34 million, or $1.50 a share, down from $38.4 million, or $1.70 a share, a year earlier, <PERSON>Richard P. Simmons</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, told institutional investors in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
The No. 1 domestic aluminum producer, <ORGANIZATION>Aluminum Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, Friday said its earnings fell 3.2% to $219 million, or $2.46 a share.
Analysts on average had been expecting about $2.70 for <LOCATION>Alcoa</LOCATION> and $1 for <LOCATION>Alcan</LOCATION>. 
"It's a good indication that level of profitability has peaked for the industry," says <PERSON>Vahid Fathi</PERSON>, metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Prescott, Ball & Turben Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, who had estimated <ORGANIZATION>Reynolds</ORGANIZATION> would earn about $2.35 a share. 
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Reynolds</ORGANIZATION> closed at $55.375, up $1.25. 
Results for the 1988 quarter included a gain of $1.05 a share from sale of the <ORGANIZATION>Reda Pump</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Oilwell Cable</ORGANIZATION> units, partly offset by a charge of 69 cents a share for recall of faulty truck steering systems.
<PERSON>E. Robert Wallach</PERSON>, former personal legal adviser to ex-Attorney General <PERSON>Edwin Meese</PERSON>, was sentenced to six years in prison and fined $250,000 for his role in the <ORGANIZATION>Wedtech Corp.</ORGANIZATION> scandal. 
The charges involved $425,000 in payments he got from <ORGANIZATION>Wedtech</ORGANIZATION> in return for promising to use his influence with <PERSON>Mr. Meese</PERSON> and other federal officials on behalf of the now-defunct defense contractor. 
Though <PERSON>Mr. Wallach</PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON>Gary Naftalis</PERSON>, described the defendant as "a relatively minor player" in the <ORGANIZATION>Wedtech</ORGANIZATION> political-corruption case, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Richard Owen</PERSON> strongly disagreed.
At the sentencing in federal court in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Judge Owen</PERSON> told <PERSON>Mr. Wallach</PERSON>: "You sold your federal office and the integrity of your federal office for $300,000 before you even got the office." 
The money was allegedly paid to <PERSON>Mr. Wallach</PERSON> in anticipation of his being appointed to a top position in the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>, but that appointment was never made.
<ORGANIZATION>Wedtech</ORGANIZATION>, a minority-owned company in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>South Bronx</LOCATION>, accounted for the payments as consulting fees, though no services were actually provided, the government charged. 
<PERSON>Mr. Wallach</PERSON>'s co-defendants, <PERSON>W. Franklyn Chinn</PERSON> and <PERSON>R. Kent London</PERSON>, were also sentenced.
<PERSON>Mr. Chinn</PERSON>, formerly a financial adviser to <PERSON>Mr. Meese</PERSON>, was sentenced to three years and fined $100,000.
<PERSON>Mr. London</PERSON>, who along with <PERSON>Mr. Chinn</PERSON> worked as a financial consultant to <ORGANIZATION>Wedtech</ORGANIZATION>, was sentenced to five years and fined $250,000.
Before issuing the sentences, <PERSON>Judge Owen</PERSON> criticized <PERSON>Mr. Wallach</PERSON> for a host of alleged ethical and legal improprieties, some of which had nothing to do with the <ORGANIZATION>Wedtech</ORGANIZATION> case and most of which involved <PERSON>Mr. Meese</PERSON>.
As court officers sought to get help for the woman, the judge said, <PERSON>Mr. Wallach</PERSON> "charged at the jury and screamed, `You see what you have done. '" The judge said he didn't understand why <PERSON>Mr. Wallach</PERSON>, an experienced trial lawyer, would commit such an outburst, but he said <PERSON>Mr. Wallach</PERSON> may have hoped the jury would be unable to continue with its verdict. 
After the sentencing, <PERSON>Mr. Wallach</PERSON> blamed his <ORGANIZATION>Wedtech</ORGANIZATION> woes on his longtime friendship with <PERSON>Mr. Meese</PERSON>.
He said prosecutors "were looking for a man between Ed Meese and <ORGANIZATION>Wedtech</ORGANIZATION>. . . . If they could have gotten <PERSON>Ed Meese</PERSON> that would have been the fulfillment of the dreams." 
<LOCATION>Mr. London</LOCATION> must forfeit $99,000, and <PERSON>Mr. Chinn</PERSON> must forfeit $20,000; together, <PERSON>Mr. Chinn</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. London</PERSON> must jointly forfeit an additional $1.14 million. 
<PERSON>Mr. Naftalis</PERSON> said <PERSON>Mr. Wallach</PERSON> had been "financially devastated" by the <ORGANIZATION>Wedtech</ORGANIZATION> scandal.
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge David Edelstein</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> ruled that the elections officer will play an extensive role in all phases of the <ORGANIZATION>International Brotherhood of Teamsters</ORGANIZATION>' 1991 election of top union officials. 
But <ORGANIZATION>Teamsters</ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON>James Grady</PERSON> claimed that the power bestowed upon the court-appointed officer was a departure from the terms of the union's agreement with the government earlier this year.
<PERSON>Mr. Grady</PERSON> added that to fund the type of supervision <PERSON>Judge Edelstein</PERSON> described would cost the union at least $3.5 million. 
In March, the <ORGANIZATION>Teamsters</ORGANIZATION> agreed to a settlement of civil racketeering charges brought by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>.
A special master, appointed by the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>, received evidence yesterday about comments made by <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Jack Hampton</PERSON> in the wake of a murder trial in December. 
The comments touched off a furor in the <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> gay community and prompted several complaints about <PERSON>Judge Hampton</PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION>State Commission on Judicial Conduct</ORGANIZATION>.
The commission, which could remove <PERSON>Judge Hampton</PERSON> from the bench, will act after reviewing findings to be submitted within two weeks by special master <PERSON>Robert R. Murray</PERSON> of <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>. 
At a hearing yesterday, <PERSON>Judge Hampton</PERSON>'s defense team, which included former <ORGANIZATION>Dallas County District Attorney Henry Wade</ORGANIZATION> and former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON>Jim Rolfe</PERSON>, accused the <ORGANIZATION>Times Herald</ORGANIZATION> reporter of misquoting the judge.
But <PERSON>Bill Hornung</PERSON>, general counsel for the judicial-conduct commission, said the defense team was sidestepping the focus of the inquiry -- whether <PERSON>Judge Hampton</PERSON> violated judicial ethics by commenting to the public while a motion for new trial was pending. 
<PERSON>Sen. Joseph Biden</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Del.</LOCATION>), committee chairman, proposed legislation that would carry out the streamlining of death-penalty appeals in federal court that was proposed last month by a special task force appointed by Chief Justice of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <PERSON>William Rehnquist</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Sen. Biden</PERSON> proposed the legislation to comply with a law passed last year requiring the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> to expedite consideration of proposals made by the task force, led by retired <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court Justice</ORGANIZATION> <PERSON>Lewis Powell</PERSON>. 
When Chief Justice <PERSON>Rehnquist</PERSON> sent the report to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, a majority of federal judges on the policy-making <ORGANIZATION>Judicial Conference</ORGANIZATION> complained they hadn't been given a chance to consider the recommendations. 
<PERSON>Leslie Harris</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>American Civil Liberties Union</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman criticized the <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> proposals, but said the <LOCATION>Biden</LOCATION> legislation is "a more moderate, thoughtful approach," although the group will likely oppose it. 
<ORGANIZATION>APPLE COMPUTER Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's former general counsel <PERSON>John P. Karalis</PERSON> joined the <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, law firm of <ORGANIZATION>Brown & Bain</ORGANIZATION>.
This was due in large measure to a drought-related production curtailment at its <LOCATION>Ketchikan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, pulp mill. 
<ORGANIZATION>CAE Industries Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> said its Link Flight Simulation division was awarded a contract by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> for two helicopter simulators, which the company valued at as much as 37 million Canadian dollars (US$31.5 million). 
The price of the second simulator ranges between C$16.4 million and C$18 million, <ORGANIZATION>CAE</ORGANIZATION> said, depending on when the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> exercises its option. 
According to participants at the meeting and <LOCATION>Soviet</LOCATION> journalists who were later briefed by their editors, <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON> blamed the press for fueling a nationwide mood of despondency.
He singled out the daily <LOCATION>Izvestia</LOCATION> and the weekly <ORGANIZATION>Argumenty</ORGANIZATION> i <ORGANIZATION>Fakty</ORGANIZATION>, and also gave stinging criticism of <PERSON>Yuri Afanasyev</PERSON>, a leading reformist historian who has written articles attacking the <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION>.
Among other things, <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON> questioned whether <PERSON>Mr. Afanasyev</PERSON> should remain in the party. 
According to participants, <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON> was particularly incensed by an article on the front page of <ORGANIZATION>Argumenty</ORGANIZATION> i Fakty this month that examined the popularity of members of the Soviet Parliament.
The Soviet leader apparently suggested to <LOCATION>Argumenty</LOCATION> i <ORGANIZATION>Fakty</ORGANIZATION>'s editor, <PERSON>Vyacheslav Starkov</PERSON>, that he should resign.
<PERSON>Mr. Starkov</PERSON> has been summoned to see the <LOCATION>Kremlin</LOCATION>'s ideology chief, <PERSON>Vadim Medvedev</PERSON>, in the near future, and may discover then if he is to be fired. 
<LOCATION>Izvestia</LOCATION> was criticized for a front-page article last Wednesday that took a sharp look at the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>'s activities.
Speaking to foreign reporters, <PERSON>Ivan Laptev</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Izvestia</LOCATION>'s editor, sought to play down <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON>'s criticism, but he acknowledged that his paper had been singled out.
<LOCATION>Tegal</LOCATION>, a <LOCATION>Petaluma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, supplier to the semiconductor industry, has annual sales of about $55 million. 
Some people on <LOCATION>Wall Street</LOCATION> -- and even some in the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration -- think that Transportation Secretary <PERSON>Samuel Skinner</PERSON> may have played a second-hand role in the stock slide. 
<PERSON>Mr. Skinner</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>LBO</ORGANIZATION> comments "probably helped discourage some of the banks from participating" in the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> deal, says <PERSON>Louis Marckesano</PERSON>, airline analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> brokerage house. "The government is putting its nose where it doesn't belong, and <PERSON>Skinner</PERSON> is at the head of the pack." 
Many others -- indeed, most industry officials and members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> -- absolve <PERSON>Mr. Skinner</PERSON>, saying that the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> deal was flawed from the start.
But whether he single-handedly sparked the crash or had nothing to do with it, one thing is clear in the aftermath of the price slide: <PERSON>Sam Skinner</PERSON>, by his repeated jawboning on the buy-out issue, has irritated some in the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration, so much so that some <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> officials want to rein him in. 
Yesterday, for example, the administration came out in opposition to legislation to strengthen the <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION>'s hand in blocking leveraged buy-outs -- despite statements by <PERSON>Mr. Skinner</PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> that suggested he looked favorably on it, without explicitly endorsing it.
Moreover, administration officials say that <ORGANIZATION>Office of Management and Budget</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>Richard Darman</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Nicholas Brady</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Council of Economic Advisers Michael Boskin</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON>Carla Hills</PERSON> all have had problems with <PERSON>Mr. Skinner</PERSON>'s jawboning. 
Secretary <PERSON>Skinner</PERSON>, for his part, says "it's silly" to blame him for the market crash. "The banks in this country and in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> couldn't put the financing together on the terms offered," he said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, where he was speaking to the <ORGANIZATION>Economic Club of Detroit</ORGANIZATION>. "They have the same kind of questions that I raised about the financial aspects of the transaction." 
Last month, <PERSON>Mr. Skinner</PERSON> forced <ORGANIZATION>Northwest Airlines</ORGANIZATION> to reduce a stake held by <ORGANIZATION>KLM Royal Dutch Airlines</ORGANIZATION> to ensure, he said, that the foreign airline wouldn't illegally control <ORGANIZATION>Northwest</ORGANIZATION>. 
"It's a regulatory scandal," says <PERSON>Timothy Pettee</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION> airline analyst, who contends that the lack of clear standards raises the specter of inconsistent decision-making and unfair treatment. 
But others say <PERSON>Mr. Skinner</PERSON> is gagged until the <ORGANIZATION>Economic Policy Council</ORGANIZATION>, a cabinet-level group that makes decisions on national economic issues, finishes its ruminations on the issue.
But although the administration has yet to reach a decision on airline buy-outs, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Brady</PERSON> in general don't have philosophical problems with leveraged buy-outs or foreign investment involving non-airline companies, and don't appear inclined to block them.
Under the original <ORGANIZATION>Northwest Airlines</ORGANIZATION> bid, <ORGANIZATION>KLM</ORGANIZATION> would have contributed 57% of the equity but received only 5% of the voting stock. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION> concluded that was a violation of the spirit, if not the letter, of the law, and persuaded <ORGANIZATION>Northwest</ORGANIZATION> to restructure the deal.
It appears that some leading administration officials believe the <ORGANIZATION>Northwest</ORGANIZATION> decision leaves the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> open to charges of protectionism and could undermine the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> position in international trade talks.
<PERSON>Mr. Skinner</PERSON>, they complain, went too far in defining "control" by <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> citizens and should be discouraged from applying the same reasoning to future buy-outs. 
<PERSON>Mr. Skinner</PERSON> plays down any rift in the administration on the foreign-ownership question. "I think that <PERSON>Darman</PERSON>, <PERSON>Brady</PERSON>, <PERSON>Boskin</PERSON> and I all have the same basic understanding of the importance of foreign investment in this country," he said yesterday. "And they all understand I have a statutory duty to enforce safety and existing law regarding foreign ownership." 
But some experts say that there isn't a correlation between an airline's debt load and its safety record. "No systematic link between finances and safety has ever been demonstrated," says <PERSON>Michael Levine</PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION>Yale University School of Organization</ORGANIZATION> and Management and formerly a top official with the <ORGANIZATION>Civil Aeronautics Board</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Skinner</PERSON> satisfied his safety concerns on the <ORGANIZATION>Northwest</ORGANIZATION> deal by requiring the airline to file certain financial information that could affect safety, including maintenance expenditures.
Several members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, generally delighted with <PERSON>Mr. Skinner</PERSON>'s activist approach to buy-outs, want the department to be able to block the deals before they become final.
That, says <ORGANIZATION>House Aviation Subcommittee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>James Oberstar</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> Democrat, is like "using a howitzer to go deer hunting." 
"If you look at 75 years worth of investment history -- including the <ORGANIZATION>Great Depression</ORGANIZATION> and every bear market since -- stocks have outperformed almost everything an individual could have owned by a long shot," says <PERSON>Barry Berlin</PERSON>, vice president at <ORGANIZATION>First Wachovia Capital Management</ORGANIZATION>. 
A dollar invested in the stock market in 1926 would have grown to $473.29 by the end of last June, according to <PERSON>Laurence Siegel</PERSON>, managing director at <ORGANIZATION>Ibbotson Associates Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
For instance, <PERSON>Ken Gregory</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> money manager, calculates that if an investor holds a basket of stocks that tracks the <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor</ORGANIZATION>'s 500-stock index, the chance of losing money is 3% to 4% over a 10-year period, compared with 15% over three years and 30% over one year. 
Stock-market investments also help balance the other assets an individual owns, says <PERSON>John Blankenship Jr.</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Institute of Certified Financial Planners</ORGANIZATION>.
People also shouldn't invest money in stocks that they'll need in the near future -- for example, for college tuition payments or retirement expenses. "You may have to sell your stocks at a time when the market takes a plunge," says <PERSON>Mr. Blankenship</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Del Mar</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION> financial planner. 
But once the basics are covered, "then I would start to invest, even if it's as little as $1,000," says <PERSON>Michael Lipper</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Lipper Analytical Services Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
Despite the strong case for stocks, however, most pros warn that individuals shouldn't try to profit from short-term developments. "It's very difficult to do," says <PERSON>Donald Holt</PERSON>, a market strategist for <ORGANIZATION>Wedbush Morgan Securities</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> brokerage firm. "Our markets move so fast and they are so volatile, there's no way the average investor can compete with the pros." 
The cost of executing stock orders varies from brokerage to brokerage and with the size of the order, but 2% of the order's value is an average, says <PERSON>Stephen Boesel</PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION>T. Rowe Price's Growth and Income</ORGANIZATION> mutual fund. 
<PERSON>George Douglas</PERSON>, first vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, says that individuals have a particular edge now in "small to medium-size niche companies with exciting earnings prospects" -- a traditional stomping ground for small investors.
This growth sector, which usually carries a price/earnings multiple about twice that of the <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor</ORGANIZATION>'s 500, happens to include some of the market's most attractive bargains right now. "It's now selling at a multiple about even with the market," says <PERSON>Mr. Douglas</PERSON>. 
Friday's correction presents "a pretty good buying opportunity, but let's not speculate at this point in the business cycle," says <PERSON>Carmine Grigoli</PERSON>, chief equity portfolio strategist at <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp.</ORGANIZATION> "Buy stocks on weakness for their long-term fundamentals," he says. 
That cuts the risk, <PERSON>Mr. Gregory</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> money manager, points out. 
<ORGANIZATION>UGI Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said its AmeriGas subsidiary completed the previously announced sale of its air separation plant and related assets in <LOCATION>Waukesha</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION>, to <ORGANIZATION>AGA Gas Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>.
The chains include <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale's</ORGANIZATION>, owned by <ORGANIZATION>Campeau Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Saks Fifth Avenue</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Marshall Field</ORGANIZATION>'s, owned by <ORGANIZATION>B.A.T Industries PLC</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION>B. Altman & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sakowitz Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, owned by <ORGANIZATION>Hooker Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which is now being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator.
Hooker is based in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. 
The combination of so many chains available for sale, the recent failures of such retailing <ORGANIZATION>LBO</ORGANIZATION>'s as <ORGANIZATION>Miller & Rhoads Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and declining investor confidence will drive down prices, retailing observers said. 
"The pricing will become more realistic, which should help management," said <PERSON>Bruce Rosenthal</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investment banker with <ORGANIZATION>Nathan S. Jonas & Co.</ORGANIZATION> "Investors aren't going to be throwing money at any of the proposed LBOs, but doing deals on the basis of ridiculous assumptions never made sense, either." 
"Competition from third parties who have cash and are prepared to buy has always existed and will continue," added <PERSON>Mr. Rosenthal</PERSON>. "But when prices were crazy, it was even harder to do an <ORGANIZATION>LBO</ORGANIZATION>. Bankers believed in the greater-fool theory that says somebody else is always willing to pay more.
At <ORGANIZATION>Saks Fifth Avenue</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Paul Leblang</PERSON>, senior vice president, marketing, agreed that lower prices will help his management team in their proposed LBO. 
To make an <ORGANIZATION>LBO</ORGANIZATION> work, now we are going to need more than just junk bonds." None believe the proposed management LBOs will be easy to complete, especially at <ORGANIZATION>B. Altman & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which is under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
"What's encouraging about this is that retail chains will be sold on the basis of their sales and earnings, not liquidation values," said <PERSON>Joseph E. Brooks</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Ann Taylor Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a specialty chain. "Retailers who had good track records of producing profits will have a better chance to buy back their companies." 
"Prices for retail chains are lower today than they were last week, which will help management," said <PERSON>Gilbert Harrison</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Financo Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, an investment-banking firm specializing in retailing acquisitions. "But the hurdle of financing still has to be resolved.
The placement was made through <ORGANIZATION>Gray Seifert Securities</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, to institutional investors.
<ORGANIZATION>National Geographic</ORGANIZATION>, the sixth-largest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> magazine, is attracting more readers than ever and offers the glossy, high-toned pages that upscale advertisers love. 
Even though <ORGANIZATION>National Geographic</ORGANIZATION> offers far more readers than does a magazine like Smithsonian, "the page costs you an arm and a leg to develop any frequency,"says Harry Glass, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> media manager for <ORGANIZATION>Bozell Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
The campaign, created by <ORGANIZATION>Omnicom Group</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>DDB Needham</ORGANIZATION> agency, takes advantage of the eye-catching photography that <ORGANIZATION>National Geographic</ORGANIZATION> is known for.
In one ad, a photo of the interior of the <LOCATION>Sainte-Chapelle</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> is paired with the headline, "The only book more respected than ours doesn't accept advertising." Another ad pictures a tree ant, magnified 80 times, with the headline, "For impact far beyond your size consider our regional editions." 
<ORGANIZATION>WCRS</ORGANIZATION> has been in discussions with <ORGANIZATION>Eurocom</ORGANIZATION> for several months.
However, when negotiations bogged down recently, <ORGANIZATION>WCRS</ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive, <PERSON>Peter Scott</PERSON>, met in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> with another French firm, <PERSON>Boulet Dru Dupuy Petit</PERSON>, or <ORGANIZATION>BDDP</ORGANIZATION>.

In fact, <PERSON>Kazuo Ishiguro</PERSON>'s "The Remains of the Day" (<ORGANIZATION>Knopf</ORGANIZATION>, 245 pages, $18.95) is both an homage to traditional English forms and a dramatic critique of them.
As the narrator <PERSON>Stevens</PERSON>, the solitary butler of <PERSON>Darlington Hall</PERSON>, mulls over such hallowed terms as "greatness," "dignity," "service" and "loyalty," we see how pious cant subverts the soul.
As he stands on a hill at the beginning of a six-day motor expedition from <LOCATION>Oxfordshire</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Cornwall</LOCATION>, where a former housekeeper resides, perhaps the victim of an unhappy 20-year marriage, perhaps (he hopes with more fervor than he will ever acknowledge) not disinclined to return to domestic service, <PERSON>Stevens</PERSON> surveys the view and thereby provides a self-portrait, a credo and the author's metaphor for the aesthetic of the novel we're reading: 
In comparison, the sorts of sights offered in such places as <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, though undoubtedly very exciting, would, I am sure, strike the objective viewer as inferior on account of their unseemly demonstrativeness." 
<PERSON>Mr. Ishiguro</PERSON>'s ability to create a fallible narrative voice that permits him to explore such intertwining domestic, cultural and political themes was abundantly clear in his previous novel, "An Artist of the Floating World," set in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> after the war.
Now shifting his scene from the country he left at five to the <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> he has lived in for nearly 30 years, he has fashioned a novel in the mode of <PERSON>Henry James</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>E.M. Forster</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Locke</PERSON> teaches English and comparative literature at <ORGANIZATION>Columbia University</ORGANIZATION>. 
Making matters worse was the fact that late Friday afternoon the <ORGANIZATION>CBOE</ORGANIZATION> halted stock-index options trading in step with the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION>'s halt in stock-index futures.
But while the <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> reopened a half hour later, the <ORGANIZATION>CBOE</ORGANIZATION> remained closed, leaving many options traders unable to make trades that might have reduced the losses. 
<ORGANIZATION>CBOE</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Alger</PERSON> "Duke" <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON>, said that, unlike the futures market, the options exchange has to open in a rotation that allows each different options series to trade.
The damage was so bad at <ORGANIZATION>Fossett Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, an options trading firm here, that it was forced to transfer its accounts to <ORGANIZATION>First Options of Chicago</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Continental Bank Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, as a result of options trading losses.
Thus, in an unprecedented arrangement underscoring the seriousness of the transfer, the <ORGANIZATION>CBOE</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Options Clearing Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, as well as the firm's owner, <PERSON>Stephen Fossett</PERSON>, put up a total of $50 million to guarantee the customer positions being transferred to the bank holding company subsidiary in case the market plunged again yesterday. 
<PERSON>S. Waite Rawls III</PERSON>, vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Continental Bank</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>First Options</ORGANIZATION>' parent company, said the firm took on about 160 accounts formerly held by <PERSON>Fossett</PERSON>, almost all of them belonging to professional floor traders. 
"<PERSON>Steve</PERSON> and his firm were still worth a lot of money," <PERSON>Mr. Rawls</PERSON> said. "A package of credit support was put together -- including the assets of <PERSON>Steve</PERSON> and his firm." 
The bailout was cobbled together over the weekend, with officials from the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Board</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>, Comptroller of the Currency and <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> as well as the options exchanges. "It was great to have the luxury of time," <PERSON>Mr. Rawls</PERSON> said. 
At one point, an options industry official had to talk the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago</ORGANIZATION>'s night watchman into giving him the home phone number of <PERSON>Silas Keene</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Fed</ORGANIZATION> president. 
Yesterday's rally in the stock, futures and options markets led <ORGANIZATION>CBOE</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Amex</ORGANIZATION> officials to conclude that the $50 million in guarantees almost certainly won't need to be tapped by First Options. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Fossett</ORGANIZATION> firm had some losses and liquidity problems during the October 1987 crash as well, <PERSON>Mr. Rawls</PERSON> said. 
A federal official said that <ORGANIZATION>Continental Bank</ORGANIZATION> worked with securities and banking regulators over the weekend to fashion the <PERSON>Fossett</PERSON> bailout, but that conditions weren't dictated by those agencies. "It was their business decision," the official said. 
Officials at <ORGANIZATION>Options Clearing Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which processes all options trades for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> exchanges, said that the $50 million guarantee was unprecedented, but was necessary to help insure the integrity of the options markets. "It was an extraordinary situation that needed extraordinary steps," said <PERSON>Paul Stevens</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>OCC</ORGANIZATION> president and chief operating officer. 
But <ORGANIZATION>CBOE</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Amex</ORGANIZATION> officials said that <ORGANIZATION>Options Clearing Corp.</ORGANIZATION> contributed $20 million to the guarantee, the <ORGANIZATION>CBOE</ORGANIZATION> put up $8 million, the <ORGANIZATION>Amex</ORGANIZATION> added $4 million and $18 million came from <PERSON>Mr. Fossett</PERSON>'s own assets. 
In a sign of its continuing problems in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auto market, <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> acknowledged that a key midsized-car plant will shut down for two weeks to cut bulging inventories of Pontiac Grand Prix models. 
Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Roger B. Smith</PERSON> said it should be "no surprise" the auto maker is moving to close permanently more North American assembly plants.
At an <ORGANIZATION>Economic Club of Detroit</ORGANIZATION> luncheon, <PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON> said announcements last week that indicated at least three and perhaps five more <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> plants in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> may close by the early 1990s reflect "a carefully conceived, calculated and executed strategic plan." 
<PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> is looking for ways to save some of the five older plants targeted last week. "I'm hoping we'll need another plant for the <ORGANIZATION>APV</ORGANIZATION>," a new plastic-bodied minivan now being assembled at a single plant in <LOCATION>Tarrytown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, he said.
But <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> is also struggling with a steep decline in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> car-market share that wasn't part of the company's strategic plans when it began the modernization program.
The latest evidence of that is the decision to idle the <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kan.</LOCATION>, plant that makes the Grand Prix less than three weeks into the new model year. 
But <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> officials confirmed they will close the <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> plant for two weeks beginning Oct. 30 because of slow sales, bringing to 10 the number of weeks it will have been closed since early June.
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> car dealers had a 92-day supply of the cars at the end of September, according to industry trade publication <ORGANIZATION>Wards Automotive</ORGANIZATION> Reports.
Union officials at the <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> plant said the company is studying the feasibility of giving the plant another product to build, contrary to <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s original plan.
Insurance-industry consultant <PERSON>Benjamin Zycher</PERSON>'s attack on Proposition 103, the landmark insurance-reform initiative approved by <LOCATION>Californians</LOCATION> last November ("Insurance Fraud, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Style," Oct. 9) is much like the industry's unsuccessful $80 million campaign against the measure: distorted and often dishonest. 
"We're very concerned about the financial well-being of the firms," said <PERSON>Martin Kuperberg</PERSON>, who runs the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> broker-dealer unit. "We've spoken to a number of people both at the {exchanges} and at the firms." 
Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> held a series of discussions with officials from the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION>, the exchanges, the <ORGANIZATION>Commodity Futures Trading Commission</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Council of Economic Advisers</ORGANIZATION> to see whether market mechanisms were working properly. 
In his first statement since the recent market gyrations began, <PERSON>Richard Breeden</PERSON>, who was sworn in as <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> chairman last week, said the "markets' trading and order routing systems generally operated quite smoothly.
Two weeks ago, for example, the agency censured <ORGANIZATION>Prudential Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ORGANIZATION> for failing to adequately keep track of customers' funds.
The move was in part a warning to firms that the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> will try to crack down on firms if their back offices aren't in order and become a danger in the event of a major market move. "It notifies the broker-dealer community that we won't tolerate this kind of action," <PERSON>Mr. Kuperberg</PERSON> said. 
Two years ago, many market makers refused to answer their phones, creating frustration and losses among investors looking to sell stocks. "The market-making firms responded pretty well," said <PERSON>Joseph Hardiman</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Nasdaq</ORGANIZATION> president. "We've had little to no complaints." 
Your <PERSON>James P. Sterba</PERSON> thought that our <PERSON>James P. Sterba</PERSON> was an impostor? ("Will the Real Jim Please Stand Up?" <ORGANIZATION>Leisure & Arts</ORGANIZATION>, Sept. 27.) How preposterous! I always thought your <PERSON>Sterba</PERSON> was the charlatan. 
But that gets too philosophical, and since there are no libraries in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> either, who can solve the riddle of the two <PERSON>Sterbas</PERSON>? 
Nearly all of the big paper losses were caused by declines of more than 20% in two airline stocks, <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>AMR Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Wall Street's arbitrage desks had loaded up on stocks of both companies after each had received takeover proposals from investors.
The bid for <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> came from <PERSON>Marvis Davis</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, and the bid for <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> came from <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
But in the wake of Friday's announcement that a <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> management-union group couldn't obtain bank financing for its agreement to buy <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> at $300 a share, <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stock plunged $56.875 yesterday to close at $222.875 a share in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading of nearly 2.3 million shares.
That was bad enough for the arbs. "On balance, the Street's biggest position has been <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>, mostly {bought} in the $280 range," said <PERSON>Frank Gallagher</PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION>Phoenix Capital Markets</ORGANIZATION>, who follows arbitrage activity. 
But the arbs were quickly hit with another dose of bad news when <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> announced that he was withdrawing his proposal to buy <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> at $120 a share.
After trading in <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> resumed, the stock fell sharply to close at $76.50 a share, down $22.125 on the day in <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> composite trading of more than 4.7 million shares. 
<PERSON>Mr. Gallagher</PERSON> estimates that arbitragers owned the equivalent of nearly 30% of <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>'s stock, or about six million shares, indicating losses of about $350 million.
<PERSON>Mr. Gallagher</PERSON> thinks that much of the heavy trading in <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> shares was "one arb passing it on to another.
Gainers among the arb's favorite stocks included <ORGANIZATION>Hilton Hotels Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which rose $9.50 a share to close at $94.50 in <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, and <ORGANIZATION>Warner Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which rose $1.875 to close at $63.375.
Hilton is soliciting bids for some or all of its hotel and casino operations; <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> is being acquired by <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which already owns about 58% of <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>. 
In October 1987, however, stocks of some potential takeover targets, such as <ORGANIZATION>Dayton Hudson Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, fell about 50%, <PERSON>Mr. Gallagher</PERSON> said. 
In an excursus of little relevance to his central point about private enforcement suits by environmental groups, <PERSON>Michael S. Greve</PERSON> informs your readers, ". . . the Clean Water Act is written upon the presumption -- the pretense, rather -- that nothing but zero risk will do; it establishes a legal standard of zero discharge" ("<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>'s Environmental Buccaneers," Sept. 18). 
Perhaps <PERSON>Mr. Greve</PERSON> was confused by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>'s meaningless statement of "the national goal" in section 101, which indeed calls for the elimination of discharges -- by 1985, no less.
Thus, you do the public a great disservice when <PERSON>Mr. Greve</PERSON> suggests, even facetiously, that the Clean Water Act prohibits the preparation of a scotch and water; your tippling readers may be led to believe that nothing but chance or oversight protects them, as they cower in the night with their scotch and waters, from the hairyknuckled knock of the <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Club</ORGANIZATION> at their doors. 
In what is believed to be the first cancellation of a loan to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> since the June 4 killings in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>, an international bank syndicate has terminated a $55 million credit for a <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION> property project. 
The syndicate, led by <ORGANIZATION>Schroders Asia Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, agreed last November to provide the loan to <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Development Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> property developer.
<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> Development and <ORGANIZATION>Schroders</ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on the move. 
Lenders had doubts about the project even before June 4, but the harsh crackdown, which caused many businesses to reassess their <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> transactions, "gave the banks the out they wanted," says an official close to the <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION> venture. 
The canceled <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION> loan leaves <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> Development, a small concern, saddled with a half-completed 32-story apartment building and heavy debts.
The company owes $11 million to the Shui On Group, the project's <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> contractor, and a significant, though unspecified, amount in legal fees to <ORGANIZATION>Coudert Brothers</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> law firm, the sources say. 
Instead, the banks secured a promise from state-owned <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Communications</ORGANIZATION> that it would lend <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> Development the entire $55 million at maturity to finance repayment of the original borrowing.
But in a letter sent in August to <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> Development, <PERSON>Schroders</PERSON> said the loan was terminated because the developer had failed to deliver adequate financial data and pay certain fees to the loan-management committee on time, according to officials close to the project.
The bank syndicate is made up mostly of <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> banks, but it includes <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s state-owned <ORGANIZATION>Citic Industrial Bank</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Dallas Morning News</ORGANIZATION>, the No. 1 paper in town, has secured exclusive rights here to <ORGANIZATION>Universal Press Syndicate</ORGANIZATION>'s features, including 26 previously carried by its struggling rival, the <ORGANIZATION>Dallas Times Herald</ORGANIZATION>.
The move was a stunning coup, nabbing some of the <ORGANIZATION>Times Herald</ORGANIZATION>'s biggest draws, including "Dear Abby," "Doonesbury," <PERSON>Erma Bombeck</PERSON>'s column and "The Far Side." It also reignited a long-running newspaper war that had cooled last year after closely held <ORGANIZATION>DTH Media Inc.</ORGANIZATION> bought the <ORGANIZATION>Times Herald</ORGANIZATION>. 
"We're very concerned," says <PERSON>Tom King</PERSON>, the editor and president of the <ORGANIZATION>El Paso Herald-Post</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Scripps Howard</ORGANIZATION> newspaper that competes with a <ORGANIZATION>Gannett Corp.</ORGANIZATION> paper. "It certainly looks like it could lead to bidding wars." 
Industry executives say the columns and cartoons give newspapers consistency and build fierce reader loyalty. "I have people tell me that <PERSON>Garfield</PERSON> is the only reason they read the {<ORGANIZATION>Arkansas</ORGANIZATION>} <ORGANIZATION>Gazette</ORGANIZATION>," says <PERSON>Walter E. Hussman</PERSON>, the publisher of the competing <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> Democrat.
In 1984, the <ORGANIZATION>Boston Herald</ORGANIZATION> stole about 10 features from the bigger <ORGANIZATION>Boston Globe</ORGANIZATION>, but only after the <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>'s owner, <PERSON>Rupert Murdoch</PERSON>, bought the features' syndicator.
In 1977, <ORGANIZATION>Universal</ORGANIZATION> pulled its features from the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION>Philadelphia Bulletin</ORGANIZATION> because of a contract dispute and because "there was no growth {there} for Universal," says <PERSON>John McMeel</PERSON>, president and co-owner of <ORGANIZATION>Universal</ORGANIZATION>. 
But the main reason for the move, <PERSON>Mr. McMeel</PERSON> says, is a joint venture between <ORGANIZATION>Universal</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>A.H. Belo Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the Morning News's parent and the owner of five television stations.
The <ORGANIZATION>Times Herald</ORGANIZATION> charges that the venture is a smokescreen, created to hide the News's plan to buy the features away. "We're very skeptical of a venture in which no one has invested a dollar, in which no one has any experience in syndicating animated features and game shows and for which there was not prior {market} research," says <PERSON>Roy E. Bode</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Times Herald</ORGANIZATION>'s editor. 
<PERSON>Willard Colston</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Times Syndicate</ORGANIZATION> and program director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Features Council</ORGANIZATION>, wanted the group to sponsor a panel discussion on the pact at its annual meeting in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> last week.
But <ORGANIZATION>Universal</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. McMeel</PERSON>, the council's president, asked directors to reconsider, and they voted down the discussion 13-12, <PERSON>Mr. Colston</PERSON> says. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Universal-Morning News</ORGANIZATION> deal also troubles syndicated writers and artists, who fear that they won't get their cut from this new type of exclusivity payment. (Creators of syndicated features generally receive about half the fee a newspaper pays for their work.) <PERSON>Mr. McMeel</PERSON> says some of the exclusivity payment fee will be used for future development of features and promises that those whose work appears in the Morning News will see "substantial immediate increases" in pay.
<PERSON>Arnold Schwartzman</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Dayton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, lawyer who has represented about 50 writers and artists, says that any new contract or renewal he negotiates will require that special payments be shared with his clients. 
A surge in sales in August helped trim inventory levels of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> businesses, <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> figures show. 
Continuing a trend that is putting intense pressure on <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, output at Japanese-owned and managed plants will rise 42% from year-earlier levels to an estimated 296,187 cars.
Some of the decline at the Big Three is production shifted to the "transplants": <ORGANIZATION>Diamond-Star Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> builds cars sold by <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> as well as <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Motors Corp</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Mazda Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> plant builds cars for its own and <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> dealers.
<ORGANIZATION>New United Motor Manufacturing Inc.</ORGANIZATION> supplies <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s Chevrolet and <ORGANIZATION>Toyota Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dealer networks. 
The only transplants to drop below 1988 levels are owned by <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Honda Motor Co</ORGANIZATION>. Part of the <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> decline reflects "trying to anticipate what sales" are going to be, said a spokesman.
<ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> also is adding the <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> 626 car at its <LOCATION>Flat Rock</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, plant, slowing output.
<ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION> is accelerating production after retooling its <LOCATION>Marysville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, plant to build the redesigned Accord. 
The overall decline in car production is matched by an almost equal drop of 10.6% in expected truck output at <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Nissan Motor Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Car and truck sales are expected to soften during the remainder of the year from unusually high, incentive-buoyed levels in August and September. 
"None of it is a surprise," said <PERSON>Edward Sullivan</PERSON>, vice president of automotive consulting at the <ORGANIZATION>WEFA Group</ORGANIZATION>, a market analysis firm in <LOCATION>Bala Cynwyd</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION> "Strong third-quarter sales stole from fourth-quarter sales." He said schedules at <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>, in particular, are still too high given market expectations, which will likely mean some trimming.
Much of the difference in <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION>'s car output compared with a year ago comes from having two fewer plants; <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION>'s now-shuttered facilities in <LOCATION>Kenosha</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION>, turned out 51,000 subcompacts and mid-size cars in the 1988 fourth-quarter before it closed in December. 
More than half the decline in <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s expected car output comes from closing its Escort plant in <LOCATION>Wayne</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, as of Nov. 22 to prepare for production of the next generation of the popular subcompact.
<ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION>'s Accord, made in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, was a close second to Escort in the just-ended 1989 model year.
Integrated said that it would continue to pursue "other alternatives" to sell the five core companies and that a group of senior executives plans to make a proposal to purchase three of the companies -- <ORGANIZATION>Integrated Resources Equity Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Resources Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Integrated Resources Asset Management Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
Meanwhile, a number of top sales producers from <ORGANIZATION>Integrated Resources Equity</ORGANIZATION> will meet this afternoon in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> to discuss their options.
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Integrated</ORGANIZATION> closed at $1.25 a share, down 25 cents.
"Two years ago, there was a lot of redemption activity and trouble with people getting through on the phone," said <PERSON>Kathryn McGrath</PERSON>, head of the investment management division of the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>.
At <ORGANIZATION>Scudder</ORGANIZATION> and at the smaller <ORGANIZATION>Ivy</ORGANIZATION> funds group in <LOCATION>Hingham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, for instance, some shareholders called early in the morning to switch money from stock funds to money market funds, but later called back to reverse the switches.
At <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity</ORGANIZATION>'s office in downtown <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Gerald Sherman</PERSON> walked in shortly after 7:30 a.m. and placed an order to switch his retirement accounts out of three stock funds and into a money market fund.
The $1.1 billion <ORGANIZATION>T. Rowe Price High Yield Fund</ORGANIZATION> was among the funds that borrowed during the <LOCATION>Campeau</LOCATION> crisis, says <PERSON>George J. Collins</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>T. Rowe Price Associates Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Amcore Financial Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it agreed to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Central of Illinois Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in a stock swap. 
Shareholders of <LOCATION>Central</LOCATION>, a bank holding company based in <LOCATION>Sterling</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, will receive <ORGANIZATION>Amcore</ORGANIZATION> stock equal to 10 times <ORGANIZATION>Central</ORGANIZATION>'s 1989 earnings, <ORGANIZATION>Amcore</ORGANIZATION> said.
The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> budget director, prodding <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to finish work quickly on 1990 budget bills, is trying to put some sting into the little-feared spending cuts that were triggered yesterday under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. 
Nevertheless, it may add to pressure on the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> to follow the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>'s lead and strip from pending budget legislation scores of costly, extraneous provisions. 
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON>Thomas Foley</PERSON> met with committee chairmen yesterday to try to move in that direction. "We are going to try to make an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> that the president would sign," the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> state Democrat told reporters.
House Republicans also are reluctant to pare down the 1,878-page measure -- at least until they are guaranteed that the provisions they care about will get another vote. "A lot of the guys . . . don't want it all to just die," said <ORGANIZATION>House GOP</ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON>Robert Michel</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>). 
If removed from the budget legislation, the extraneous provisions in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> bill -- including ones to cut capital-gains taxes, provide new aid for child care and repeal the catastrophic-illness insurance program -- could be reintroduced as separate bills. "What we're trying to explore now is how to protect these other issues," said <ORGANIZATION>House Budget Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Leon Panetta</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>). "We're not going to suddenly abandon them." 
<PERSON>Foley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michel</PERSON> had agreed to streamline the deficit-reduction bill before the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> even took it up, but <PERSON>Mr. Darman</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> Chief of Staff <PERSON>John Sununu</PERSON> had torpedoed that plan in order to press their fight for a cut in capital-gains taxes. 
When the fiscal year began on Oct. 1, the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Management and Budget</ORGANIZATION> began withholding 4.3% of the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION>'s money and 5.3% of other agencies' money, as the Gramm-Rudman law requires.
Taking a tough bargaining position, <PERSON>Mr. Darman</PERSON> said he opposes restoring the funds when <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> finally wraps up its work on 1990 spending.
<ORGANIZATION>Senate Budget</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>James Sasser</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>) insisted, "We don't do the <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> people any good whatsoever by standing by and letting these automatic cuts go into effect." 
To quicken the pain that the spending cuts are intended to inflict, <PERSON>Mr. Darman</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>OMB</ORGANIZATION> is making the cuts from each individual program, project or activity in the budget.
<PERSON>Mr. Darman</PERSON> said the new approach will give agencies "less ability to shift from one area to another . . . to fudge over things." But at least for some major spending programs, government budget experts said, <ORGANIZATION>OMB</ORGANIZATION> hasn't any significant control of individual programs, projects or activities. 
The new Financial Accounting Standards Board (<ORGANIZATION>FASB</ORGANIZATION>) was created in 1972 to replace the <ORGANIZATION>Accounting Principles Board</ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION>American Institute of Certified Public Accountants</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Francis M. Wheat</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> member, headed the panel that had studied the issues for a year and proposed the <ORGANIZATION>FASB</ORGANIZATION> on March 30, 1972.
Also, <PERSON>James Needham</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> commissioner, in April 1972 had warned that the industry might face a "federal agency writing accounting rules" if they rejected the <ORGANIZATION>FASB</ORGANIZATION> idea.
"The implication of an unsettled situation is that the thing could drop dramatically," says <PERSON>Henry Linsert Jr.</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Martek Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a four-year-old biotechnology company that is planning a private placement of stock. "The more variables that indicate risk, the more the investor is going to drive a hard bargain." 
Earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION>Staples Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Newton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, office-supplies discounter, said it would accelerate expansion plans nationwide and offer more of its stock to the public.
Unless the market goes right back up, he says, "it may take us six to nine months to find the money, instead of three." And the <LOCATION>Columbia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, company may have to settle for a lower price, he adds. 
<PERSON>Robertson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Stephens & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> investment banking concern, has a client that looked forward to making its initial public offering yesterday.
For many, the situation is especially discouraging because the market for IPOs was showing signs of strengthening after several years of weakness. "We were just beginning to look at the increase in IPOs, seeing the light at the end of the tunnel," says <PERSON>Frank Kline Jr.</PERSON>, partner in <LOCATION>Lambda</LOCATION> Funds, a <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, venture capital concern. "But the tunnel's just gotten longer." 
Companies planning to go public "are definitely taking a second look," says <PERSON>Allen Hadhazy</PERSON>, senior analyst at the <ORGANIZATION>Institute for Econometric Research</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Fort Lauderdale</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, which publishes the New Issues newsletter on IPOs.
<ORGANIZATION>Exabyte Corp.</ORGANIZATION> had been planning to sell 10% of its stock this week in an <ORGANIZATION>IPO</ORGANIZATION> that would raise up to $28.5 million.
But now, <PERSON>Peter Behrendt</PERSON>, president, says, "We're making decisions on a day-to-day basis." Debt-free and profitable, the <LOCATION>Boulder</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, computer-products concern could borrow funds if it decides against an <ORGANIZATION>IPO</ORGANIZATION> now, he says. 
<ORGANIZATION>KnowledgeWare Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> computer-software concern, says it is still planning to go ahead with its IPO this week or next -- unless conditions change. "It's a wait-and-see situation right now," says <PERSON>Terry McGowan</PERSON>, president. 
<ORGANIZATION>Sierra Tucson Cos.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, operator of addiction-treatment centers, has a planned doubling of capacity riding on an <ORGANIZATION>IPO</ORGANIZATION> scheduled for next week.
<PERSON>William O'Donnell</PERSON>, president, says he still thinks the <ORGANIZATION>IPO</ORGANIZATION> will succeed.
In a sagging market, the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve System</ORGANIZATION> "might flood the market with funds, and that should bring interest rates down," says <PERSON>Leonard T. Anctil</PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of New England</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>James G. Zafris</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Danvers Savings Bank</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Danvers</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, says the market turmoil "is an absolute non-event for small business." For small companies, he says, interest rates are far more important than what happens on stock exchanges.
<PERSON>Peter Drake</PERSON>, biotechnology analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Vector Securities International</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, thinks market uncertainty may encourage small companies to form more strategic alliances with big corporations.
<PERSON>Alan Wells</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Bollinger</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Wells, Lett & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> merger specialist, thinks panicky investors may lose their enthusiasm for leveraged buy-out and giant takeover deals.
And <PERSON>William E. Wetzel Jr.</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION> management professor and director of <ORGANIZATION>Venture Capital Network Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, says the market's gyrations will underline the investors' lack of control in big stock investments.
As financial markets rebounded, trading volume in the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION>'s huge <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor</ORGANIZATION>'s 500 stock-index futures pit soared, reaching near-record levels for the first time since October 1987. 
"Guys were minting money in there today," said <PERSON>John Legittino</PERSON>, a futures broker for <ORGANIZATION>Elders Futures Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. 
Several of Wall Street's largest securities firms, including <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, were also large buyers, traders said.
"With the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> around here, bragging rights are a thing of the past," said one trader, referring to the federal investigation of futures trading that so far has resulted in 46 indictments lodged against individuals on the <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Board of Trade</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>General Accounting Office</ORGANIZATION> has just completed an <ORGANIZATION>FHA</ORGANIZATION> financial audit showing a loss of $4.2 billion for fiscal 1988.
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> should not consider any expansion of <ORGANIZATION>FHA</ORGANIZATION> until a comprehensive, proven plan for <ORGANIZATION>FHA</ORGANIZATION> solvency and reform is established. 
Ignoring the <ORGANIZATION>FHA</ORGANIZATION> losses, a few of my colleagues have pushed for expansion of <ORGANIZATION>FHA</ORGANIZATION> mortgage guarantees by including wealthier home purchasers in the program.
Recently, a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Appropriations bill similarly removed the current <ORGANIZATION>FHA</ORGANIZATION> mortgage guarantee ceiling and increased it to 95% of the median home price in higher-cost areas.
Out of concern for the potentially damaging effects of this proposal, and still awaiting the <ORGANIZATION>GAO</ORGANIZATION> report on <ORGANIZATION>FHA</ORGANIZATION> losses, I suggested the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> instead work on ways to eliminate or substantially curtail this vast loan-guarantee expansion.
<PERSON>Sen. Nickles</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Okla.</LOCATION>) sits on the Appropriations and Budget committees. 
<PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>, who faced rising doubt about his bid for <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION>AMR Corp.</ORGANIZATION> even before a <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION> buy-out came apart Friday, withdrew his $7.54 billion offer. 
Separately, bankers representing the group trying to buy <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION> met with other banks about reviving that purchase at a lower price, possibly around $250 a share, or $5.65 billion.
<PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>, who vowed Wednesday to "go forward" with the bid, said he was dropping it "in light of the recent change in market conditions." He said he might now sell his <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> stake, buy more shares, or make another offer at a lower price. 
The <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> real-estate developer acted after the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> buyers failed to obtain financing for their earlier $300-a-share bid, which sparked a selling panic among that snowballed into a 190-point drop Friday in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 
News about <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION>, whose shares never reopened after trading was halted Friday for the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> announcement, sent both stocks nosediving in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> tumbled $56.875 to $222.875 on volume of 2.3 million shares, and <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> declined by $22.125 to $76.50 as 4.7 million shares changed hands.
Some said Friday's market debacle had given <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> an excuse to bail out of an offer that showed signs of stalling even before problems emerged with the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> deal.
After reaching an intraday high of $107.50 the day <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> disclosed his bid Oct. 5, <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION>'s stock had retreated as low as $97.75 last week. 
"He still hasn't proven his mettle as a big-league take-out artist," said airline analyst <PERSON>Kevin Murphy</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley & Co.</ORGANIZATION> "He's done this thing where he'll buy a little bit of a company and then trade out of it.
<PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> withdrew his bid before the <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> board, which is due to meet tomorrow, ever formally considered it.
<ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> had weighed a wide range of possible responses, from flat rejection to recapitalizations and leveraged buy-outs that might have included either employees, a friendlier buyer such as <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON>Robert Bass</PERSON>, or both. 
<ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> had also sought to foil <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> by lobbying for legislation that would have bolstered the authority of the <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION> to reject airline buy-outs.
Yesterday, <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> tried to put the blame for the collapse of the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> deal on <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, saying it was rushing through a bill to protect <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> executives. 
"I believe that the perception that legislation in this area may be hastily approved contributed to the collapse of the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> transaction, and the resulting disruption in the financial markets experienced this past Friday," <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> wrote members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> declined to comment, and <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> didn't respond to requests for interviews. 
<PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> never said how much <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> stock he had bought, only that his holdings were "substantial." However, he only received federal clearance to buy more than $15 million of the stock on Sept. 20, when the price rose $2 a share to $78.50.
Some analysts said <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Robert Crandall</PERSON> might seize the opportunity presented by the stock price drop to protect the nation's largest airline with a defensive transaction, such as the sale of stock to a friendly holder or company employees.
However, other knowledgeable observers said they believed <PERSON>Mr. Crandall</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> board might well decide to tough it out without taking any extra steps. 
Ray <ORGANIZATION>Neidl of Dillon Read & Co.</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> "is stepping back and waiting for the dust to settle.
But others remained skeptical. "I was never sure <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> really wanted to take <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION>," said <PERSON>John Mattis</PERSON>, a bond analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "What happened with <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> was a gracious way for him to bow out." <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> never obtained financing for his bid. 
Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Chase Manhattan Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the two lead lenders on the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> buy-out, met with other banks yesterday to determine if they would be willing to finance the buy-out at a lower price.
The first <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> deal unraveled after <ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION> and Chase couldn't raise $7.2 billion.
<ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Chase</PERSON> had agreed to commit $3 billion, and said they were "highly confident" of raising another $4.2 billion. 
Officials familiar with the bank talks said the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> buy-out group -- <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> pilots, management, and <ORGANIZATION>British Airways PLC</ORGANIZATION> -- is now willing to pay higher bank fees and interest, but isn't likely to boost its $965 million equity contribution. 
<LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON>, whose $275-a-share offer was rejected by <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>'s board, hasn't shown signs of pursuing a $300-a-share back-up bid he made last month. 
Also, because <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Stephen Wolf</PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> executives have joined the pilots' bid, the board might be forced to exclude him from its deliberations in order to be fair to other bidders.
"We've been spending a lot of time in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> talking to TV production people," says <PERSON>Mike Parks</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Call Interactive</ORGANIZATION>, which supplied technology for both <ORGANIZATION>ABC Sports</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s consumer minutes. "With the competitiveness of the television market these days, everyone is looking for a way to get viewers more excited." 
One of the leaders behind the expanded use of 900 numbers is <ORGANIZATION>Call Interactive</ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture of giants <ORGANIZATION>American Express Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>American Telephone & Telegraph Co</ORGANIZATION>. Formed in August, the venture weds <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION>'s newly expanded 900 service with 200 voice-activated computers in <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neb.</LOCATION>, service center. 
<ORGANIZATION>Blair Entertainment</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> firm that advises TV stations and sells ads for them, has just formed a subsidiary -- 900 <PERSON>Blair</PERSON> -- to apply the technology to television. 
<ORGANIZATION>MTV</ORGANIZATION> used one to give away the house that rock star <PERSON>Jon Bon Jovi</PERSON> grew up in.
For several years, <ORGANIZATION>Turner Broadcasting System's Cable News Network</ORGANIZATION> has invited viewers to respond nightly to topical issues ("Should the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military intervene in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>?"), but even the hottest controversies on <ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION> log only about 10,000 calls. 
<ORGANIZATION>Capital Cities/ABC Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>CBS Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>National Broadcasting Co.</ORGANIZATION> unit are expected to announce soon a joint campaign to raise awareness about hunger.
<ORGANIZATION>ABC Sports</ORGANIZATION> was looking for ways to lift deflated halftime ratings for "Monday Night Football." <PERSON>Kurt Sanger</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>ABC Sports</ORGANIZATION>'s marketing director, says that now "tens of thousands" of fans call its 900 number each week to vote for the best punt return, quarterback sack, etc. 
Profit from the calls goes to charity, but <ORGANIZATION>ABC Sports</ORGANIZATION> also uses the calls as a sales tool: After thanking callers for voting, <PERSON>Frank Gifford</PERSON> offers a football videotape for $19.95, and 5% of callers stay on the line to order it.

<PERSON>Diane Seaman</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>NBC-TV</ORGANIZATION> vice president, says <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> has been able to charge premium rates for this ad time.
"Hard Copy," the new syndicated tabloid show from <ORGANIZATION>Paramount Pictures</ORGANIZATION>, will use its 900 number for additional purposes that include research, says executive producer <PERSON>Mark B.</PERSON> von <PERSON>S. Monsky</PERSON>. "For a piece on local heroes of World War II, we can ask people to leave the name and number of anyone they know who won a medal," he says. "That'll save us time and get people involved." 
<ORGANIZATION>Fox Broadcasting</ORGANIZATION> experimented with this concept last year when viewers of "Married . . . With Children" voted on whether <PERSON>Al</PERSON> should say "I love you" to Peg on Valentine's Day. 
<ORGANIZATION>Gehl Co.</ORGANIZATION>, initial public offering of two million shares of common stock, of which 1,450,635 shares are being offered by the company and 549,365 shares by holders, via <ORGANIZATION>Blunt</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Ellis & Loewi Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Robert W.

"The stock market ain't going to do much of anything" for a while, says <PERSON>John Neff</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION> Management, who runs the $8.3 billion Windsor Fund.
"This is not a grossly overvalued market, but it's not cheap either," says <PERSON>George Collins</PERSON>, president of the mutual fund company <ORGANIZATION>T. Rowe Price Associates</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>. 
The common view, says <PERSON>Abby Cohen</PERSON>, strategist for <PERSON>Drexel Burnham Lambert</PERSON>, is that there will be "mild economic growth, modest profit expansion, and things are going to be hunky-dory.
The market "is going to wind down," says <PERSON>Gerald W. Perritt</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> money manager. "Things are a little less overpriced" after Friday's jolt in the market.
After Friday's decline, <PERSON>Mr. Perritt</PERSON>'s firm ran statistical tests on 100 high-quality stocks, using old-fashioned value criteria devised by <PERSON>Benjamin Graham</PERSON>, an analyst and author in the 1930s and 1940s who is widely considered to be the father of modern securities analysis.
<ORGANIZATION>Nicholas Parks</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> money manager, expects the market to decline about 15%. "I've been two-thirds in cash since July, and I continue to think that having a defensive position is appropriate," he says.
"Generalizations about value aren't useful," says <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> money manager <PERSON>John LeFrere</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Delta Capital Management</ORGANIZATION>.
For instance, he says, <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Unisys</ORGANIZATION> might look cheap, but investors might continue to do better with stocks like <ORGANIZATION>Walt Disney</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Procter & Gamble</ORGANIZATION> and Coca-Cola, strong performers in recent years. 
Money manager <PERSON>Robert Ross</PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION>Duncan Ross Associates Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>British Columbia</LOCATION>, says stocks would have to fall 15% to 20% before they are competitive with less risky investment alternatives.
<PERSON>Fredric Russell</PERSON>, a money manager in <LOCATION>Tulsa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Okla.</LOCATION>, says Friday's cave-in "is going to have more of a permanent impact on the psyche of many investors than Wall Street would want to admit." 
There are still bulls out there. "I still think we will have a 3000 <ORGANIZATION>Dow</ORGANIZATION>, whether it's six months or 12 months from now I don't know," says <PERSON>David Dreman</PERSON>, managing partner of <ORGANIZATION>Dreman Value Management</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. "We're doing a little buying" in some stocks "that have really been smashed down." 
Yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Dean Witter</PERSON> all increased the proportion of assets they recommend investors commit to stocks.
Dean Witter now recommends 85%, <ORGANIZATION>Goldman</ORGANIZATION> 65% and <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION> 50%. 
Some investors say Friday's sell-off was a good thing, because it deflated a lot of crazy takeover speculation. "It was a healthy cleansing," says <PERSON>Michael Holland</PERSON>, who runs <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Asset Management</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
Friday's big fall was "just a blunder by the stock market," says <PERSON>John Connolly</PERSON>, chief strategist for <PERSON>Dean Witter</PERSON>. "It was an overreaction to an event {the failure of a management and union group to get bank financing for a takeover of <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>} that doesn't mean that much to lots of stocks." Many investors have nagging worries, however.
Not even all the brokerage firms see clear sailing ahead. "Disappointing profits are likely to get worse in the next two quarters," says <PERSON>Mary Farrell</PERSON>, a market strategist at <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION>.
The issue exploded this year after a <ORGANIZATION>Federal Bureau of Investigation</ORGANIZATION> operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Wendy Gramm</PERSON>, the agency's chairman, told the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Agriculture Committee</ORGANIZATION> that she expects the study to be released within two weeks and the rule changes to be completed by Thanksgiving. 
Currently, most traders on commodity exchanges specialize in trading either for customer accounts, which makes them brokers, or for their own accounts as socalled locals. "The tests indicate that dual and non-dual traders are similar in terms of the trade executions and liquidity they provide to the market," <PERSON>Mrs. Gramm</PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> panel. 
Members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> have proposed restricting dual trading in bills to reauthorize <ORGANIZATION>CFTC</ORGANIZATION> operations.
The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> bill would force the <ORGANIZATION>CFTC</ORGANIZATION> to suspend dual trading if an exchange can't show that its oversight system can detect dual-trading abuses. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Merc</ORGANIZATION> banned dual trading in its <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor</ORGANIZATION>'s 500-stock index futures pit in 1987.
But at a meeting last week, <PERSON>Tom Donovan</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Trade</ORGANIZATION>'s president, told commodity lawyers: "Dual trading is definitely worth saving.
In fact, some auto executives suggest that slackened demand for their cars in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> is a blessing; otherwise they wouldn't be able to keep up with demand in the more profitable local market. 
"We are very lucky to easily change an export loss to domestic plus," says <PERSON>Hong Tu Pyo</PERSON>, managing director of domestic marketing for <ORGANIZATION>Hyundai Motor Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
Demand is so strong that all of the domestic makers -- <ORGANIZATION>Hyundai</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Kia Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Daewoo Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> and even upstart <ORGANIZATION>SsangYong Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> -- plan to build more factories.
At that point domestic sales will slow down," says <PERSON>Kim Yoon Kwon</PERSON>, director of marketing for <ORGANIZATION>Daewoo Motor</ORGANIZATION>. 
The reason for the tremendous demand is simple: South Koreans suddenly have a lot more money. "We never thought we'd own a car," says <PERSON>Kwang Ok Kyong</PERSON>, who just bought a <ORGANIZATION>Daewoo LeMans</ORGANIZATION> on a five-year loan.
A part of the construction-oriented conglomerate <ORGANIZATION>SsangYong Group</ORGANIZATION>, it took over the dying <ORGANIZATION>Dong-A Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> in 1986.
SsangYong began making variations of the Jeep-like "Korando" vehicle. (Dong-A had had a technology agreement with Jeep maker <ORGANIZATION>American Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, now a part of <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION>) The most popular style is the stretched "Family," which resembles a <ORGANIZATION>Ford Bronco</ORGANIZATION> or Chevy Blazer.
<ORGANIZATION>Hyundai</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Daewoo</ORGANIZATION> seem unconcerned about the SsangYong threat, but <LOCATION>Kia</LOCATION>, the scrappy No.3 auto maker, is selling four-wheel-drive vehicles through its <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> unit.
<LOCATION>Kia</LOCATION>, the only Korean car maker that has seen its overseas sales grow in 1989, aims at <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>'s common man.
Its advantage has been the peppy little Pride, sold as the <ORGANIZATION>Ford Festiva</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
<ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Mazda Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION> have equity interests in <LOCATION>Kia</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Daewoo Motor</ORGANIZATION>, a 50-50 joint venture with <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Daewoo Group</ORGANIZATION> conglomerate, is the only auto maker that appears to be hurting.
Shipments of its Lemans to <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s Pontiac division are off about 65% from a year ago, versus a 44% decline for <ORGANIZATION>Hyundai</ORGANIZATION> and an 18% increase for <LOCATION>Kia</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Hyundai</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>Korean</LOCATION> market leader with a 58% share, also plans to jump into minicars at the same time.
It turns out <PERSON>Mr. Friend</PERSON>'s client, <ORGANIZATION>Machelle Parks of Cincinnati</ORGANIZATION>, didn't like the way defense attorney <PERSON>Tom Alexander</PERSON> acted during the legal proceedings.
<PERSON>Ms. Parks</PERSON>'s mother also gets to cuff <PERSON>Mr. Alexander</PERSON>.
So does <PERSON>Mr. Friend</PERSON> and his law partner, <PERSON>Nick Nichols</PERSON>. 
The bizarre arrangement grows out of <PERSON>Mr. Alexander</PERSON>'s representation of <ORGANIZATION>Derr Construction Co.</ORGANIZATION>, one of several defendants in a wrongful death lawsuit brought by <PERSON>Ms. Parks</PERSON>, the widow of a construction worker killed in January 1987 while working on a new <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> convention center.
Last month, <PERSON>Mr. Friend</PERSON> says, <PERSON>Mr. Alexander</PERSON>'s associate agreed that <PERSON>Derr</PERSON> would pay $50,000 as part of an overall settlement. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Alexander</PERSON> scuttled the deal at the last minute, angering the plaintiff's side. "I never agreed to it," <PERSON>Mr. Alexander</PERSON> says, adding that "it's not necessary to pay these nuisance settlements." 
When <PERSON>Ms. Parks</PERSON> and her mother heard about what had happened, <PERSON>Mr. Friend</PERSON> says, they volunteered that they would like to give <PERSON>Mr. Alexander</PERSON> a good walloping.
<PERSON>Mr. Friend</PERSON> says he passed that along to his adversary, and soon they were talking about the ground rules under which <ORGANIZATION>Derr</ORGANIZATION> could keep its money and the plaintiffs could take a shot at <PERSON>Mr. Alexander</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Friend</PERSON> says he agreed to strike <PERSON>Mr. Alexander</PERSON> above the belt.
However, he acknowledges they "have the option of taking a swat at me if they really want to." <PERSON>Mr. Friend</PERSON> says his side is "dead serious." Although they don't contemplate delivering any disabling blows, he says that <PERSON>Mr. Alexander</PERSON> will be asked to sign a release from liability, just in case. 
This <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> company and its <ORGANIZATION>Union Federal Savings Bank</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary said more than 99% of their 7 1/4% convertible subordinated debentures due 2011 were tendered for conversion into <ORGANIZATION>UnionFed</ORGANIZATION> common stock.
As stocks recovered, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollar rebounded, but bond prices plunged and <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bill rates soared. 
Early yesterday, strategists at several investment firms, including <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Dean Witter Reynolds</ORGANIZATION>, urged customers to buy stocks and cut back on bonds.
"Investors had expected the worst from the stock market, and so they piled into government bonds last Friday," said <PERSON>Steven Einhorn</PERSON>, chairman of the investment policy committee at <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ORGANIZATION> "But when we didn't get the worst, there was some movement out of bonds and back into stocks" yesterday.
<PERSON>Mr. Einhorn</PERSON> early yesterday told <ORGANIZATION>Goldman</ORGANIZATION> traders and salesmen that he recommends investors increase their stock holdings. 
Speculation that the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> stands ready to act as a safety net for the financial system helped restore investor confidence yesterday, said <PERSON>Mitchell Shivers</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>MLX</ORGANIZATION>, which also makes aircraft and heavy-duty truck parts, said the debt was accumulated during its acquisition of nine businesses that make up the group, the biggest portion of which was related to the 1986 purchase of a <ORGANIZATION>Hillman Co.</ORGANIZATION> unit. 
<PERSON>William P. Panny</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>MLX</ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive, said the pact "will provide <ORGANIZATION>MLX</ORGANIZATION> with the additional time and flexibility necessary to complete the restructuring of the company's capital structure." 
<ORGANIZATION>MLX</ORGANIZATION> has filed a registration statement with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> covering a proposed offering of $120 million in long-term senior subordinated notes and warrants. 
The stock of <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION> continued to be pounded amid signs that <ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION> may balk at any hasty reformulation of the aborted $6.79 billion buy-out of <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>' parent. 
<ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stock plummeted a further $24.875 to $198 on volume of more than 2.8 million shares in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading.
<LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> financier <PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON>, who put <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> in play with a $5.4 billion bid two months ago, last night proffered both a ray of hope and an extra element of uncertainty by saying he remains interested in acquiring <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>.
Even as <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Chase Manhattan Corp.</ORGANIZATION> scrambled to line up bank financing for a revised version of the lapsed labor-management bid, <ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION>, a 15% partner in the buying group, indicated it wants to start from scratch.
Its partners are <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION>'s pilots, who were to own 75%, and <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> management at 10%. 
Adding insult to injury, <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION>'s 25,000-member Machinists' union, which helped scuttle financing for the first bid, yesterday asked <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Stephen Wolf</PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> directors to resign.
<PERSON>John Peterpaul</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Machinists</ORGANIZATION> union general vice president, attacked <PERSON>Mr. Wolf</PERSON> as "greedy and irresponsible" for pursuing the buy-out.
Although <PERSON>Mr. Wolf</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Pope</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer, stood to pocket $114.3 million for stock and options in the buy-out, <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> executives planned to reinvest only $15 million in the new company. 
Confusion about the two banks' hurried efforts to round up financing for a new bid that the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> board hasn't even seen yet helped send <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stock spiraling downward.
Late in the day, <PERSON>Mr. Wolf</PERSON> issued a onepage statement calling <PERSON>Mr. Peterpaul</PERSON>'s blast "divisive and uncalled for." But he gave few details on the progress toward a new bid, saying only, "We are working toward a revised proposal for majority employee ownership." 
In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION> Chairman Lord King was quoted in the Times as declaring he is "not prepared to take my shareholders into a hasty deal." Observers said it appeared that <ORGANIZATION>British Air</ORGANIZATION> was angered at the way the bid has degenerated into confusion, as well as by the banks' effort to round up financing for what one called "a deal that isn't a deal." 
A group of <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION>'s noncontract employees said in a statement, "The fact that <PERSON>Wolf</PERSON> and other officers were going to line their pockets with literally millions of dollars while instituting severe pay cuts on the nonunion employees of <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> is not only deplorable but inexcusable." The machinists also asked for an investigation by the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> into possible securities-law violations in the original bid for <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON>, as well as in the response by <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>. Last week, just before the bank commitments were due, the union asked the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Labor Department</ORGANIZATION> to study whether the bid violated legal standards of fairness governing employee investment funds. 
<PERSON>Mr. Wolf</PERSON> has eschewed merger advice from a major Wall Street securities firm, relying instead only on a takeover lawyer, <PERSON>Peter Atkins</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom</ORGANIZATION>. 
The huge drop in <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stock prompted one takeover stock trader, <PERSON>George Kellner</PERSON>, managing partner of <PERSON>Kellner</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>DiLeo & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, to deny publicly rumors that his firm was going out of business.
<PERSON>Mr. Kellner</PERSON> said that despite losses on <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> stock, his firm's health is "excellent." 
At a meeting Sept. 1 to consider the labor-management bid, the board also was informed by its investment adviser, <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, of interest expressed by buy-out funds including <ORGANIZATION>Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Forstmann Little & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, as well as by <PERSON>Robert Bass</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley</ORGANIZATION>'s buy-out fund, and <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
The proposed merger comes as K mart's profit is declining and sales at its core discount stores are rising more slowly than at such competitors as <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart Stores Inc</ORGANIZATION>. K mart, based in <LOCATION>Troy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, recently said net income would fall for the third consecutive quarter, after a 16% drop in the first half of its current fiscal year. 
But the <ORGANIZATION>Makro</ORGANIZATION> chain, which operates as a joint venture between K mart and <ORGANIZATION>SHV Holdings N.V.</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, has only six stores and annual sales that one analyst estimated at about $300 million. 
Six-year-old Pace, based in <LOCATION>Aurora</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, operates 41 warehouse-club stores.
"The company turned the corner fairly recently in profitability," said <PERSON>Margo McGlade</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, who had been forecasting a 46% jump in Pace's net income from operations this year and another 42% increase next year. "Warehouse productivity is really beginning to take off." 
<PERSON>Ms. McGlade</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION> raised a more fundamental question about the deal. "If K mart can't get its act together in discounting, why is it spending time worrying about other growing markets?" She said, "I would say K mart's number one job is to address its market-share loss {in discount stores}, which longer-term will lead to improved profit margins.
It also operates <ORGANIZATION>Waldenbooks</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Pay Less Drug Stores</ORGANIZATION> and Builders Square home improvement stores. 
<PERSON>Mr. Kossuth</PERSON>, 52 years old, succeeds <PERSON>Ermanno Pascutto</PERSON>, 36, who resigned to join <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Futures Commission</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Kossuth</PERSON> was vice president and director, corporate finance, of <ORGANIZATION>Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> investment dealer. 
An ebullient <PERSON>Kenneth Iverson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Nucor</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, says the company's plant eventually will make a ton of steel in 1.5 man hours, compared with four to six man hours at a conventional mill. 
"We've had the Russians and <LOCATION>Chinese</LOCATION>, and people from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> visiting us," <PERSON>Mr. Iverson</PERSON> beams. "Everyone in the world is watching us very closely." 
Already, <ORGANIZATION>USX Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Armco Inc.</ORGANIZATION> are studying <LOCATION>Nucor</LOCATION>'s technology to see if they can adopt it.
"There's a revolution ahead of us that will ultimately change the way we market and distribute steel," says <PERSON>William Dennis</PERSON>, vice president, manufacturing and technology, for the <ORGANIZATION>American Iron Ore</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Steel Institute</ORGANIZATION>. 
"The technology revolution is going to be very threatening to established producers," says <PERSON>Peter Marcus</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "They've got too much invested in the old stuff and they can't get their workers to be flexible." 
Nucor's plant in <LOCATION>Crawfordsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION>, ultimately will produce only one million tons annually, a drop in the 40-million-ton-a-year flat-rolled steel bucket, and it will be years before such plants can compete in the high-profit market.
"At this point, the minimill capacity won't make a great dent in the integrated market, but it does challenge them to develop new markets," says <PERSON>James McCall</PERSON>, vice president, materials, at <ORGANIZATION>Battelle</ORGANIZATION>, a technology and management-research giant based in <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>. 
In the past, says <ORGANIZATION>Armco</ORGANIZATION>'s chief economist <PERSON>John Corey</PERSON>, steelmakers made a product and set it out on the loading dock. "We said: `We've got a product: if you want it, you can buy it, '" he says, adding: "Now we're figuring out what people need, and are going back to make it." 
<ORGANIZATION>Armco</ORGANIZATION>'s sales representatives visit the <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> assembly plant in <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>, two or three days a week.
When they determined that <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> needed parts more quickly, <ORGANIZATION>Armco</ORGANIZATION> convinced a steel service center to build a processing plant nearby so shipments could be delivered within 15 minutes. 
For example, when <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> began talking about plastic-bodied cars, the <LOCATION>American Iron</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Steel Institute</ORGANIZATION> began a major lobbying effort to show auto makers how they could use steel more efficiently by simply redesigning how a car door is assembled. 
<ORGANIZATION>Battelle</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. McCall</PERSON> thinks steelmakers should concentrate more on construction.
<ORGANIZATION>Weirton Steel Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Weirton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>W. Va.</LOCATION>, for example, is touting to homeowners fashionable steel doors, with leaded glass inserts, as a secure and energy-efficient alternative to wooden or aluminum ones.
<ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> is funneling drilling pipe to steel-hungry <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
But unfortunately, that segment is much smaller than the bread-and-butter flat-rolled steel. "It's like everyone climbing out of the QE II and getting into a lifeboat," says <PERSON>John Jacobson</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>AUS Consultants</ORGANIZATION>. "After a while, someone has to go over the side." Although he doesn't expect any bankruptcies, he does see more plants being sold or closed. 
<PERSON>Robert Crandall</PERSON>, with the <ORGANIZATION>Brookings Institute</ORGANIZATION>, agrees. "Unless there is an enormous rate of economic growth or a further drop in the dollar, it's unlikely that consumption of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> produced steel will grow sufficiently to offset the growth of minimills." 
Moreover, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> can expect more competition from low-cost producing <LOCATION>Pacific Rim</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Latin American</LOCATION> countries.
*<ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>LTV</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Bethlehem</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Inland</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Armco</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>National Steel</ORGANIZATION> 
The <LOCATION>Hackensack</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, company said holders would receive for each $1,000 face amount, $750 face amount of a new issue of secured senior subordinated notes, convertible into common stock at an initial rate of $6.50 a share, and 50 common shares.
With a jazz-piano tape playing softly in the background, the soothing hands of <PERSON>Sabina Vidunas</PERSON> begin to work on <PERSON>Ms. Foster</PERSON>'s neck and shoulders. "It's like an oasis in this room," <PERSON>Ms. Foster</PERSON> purrs.
The room in question is the directors' lounge of <ORGANIZATION>H.J. Heinz Co.</ORGANIZATION>, 60 floors above the bustle of <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Ms. Vidunas</PERSON> has been seeing some 15 clients a visit since the program was started at <LOCATION>Heinz</LOCATION> last year.
They also insist that touching is a basic need, as powerful as the need for food or sleep, and that the office is as good a place as any to do it. "The blood flows to your head, you feel lightheaded and you don't feel tension around the head or neck," says <PERSON>Minnie Morey</PERSON>, an operations supervisor at the Social Security office in <LOCATION>Grand Rapids</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, where massages began last month. "When you leave the room after your massage, people say you look like you're glowing." Adds <PERSON>Candice Ohlman</PERSON>, the 35-year-old masseuse who plies her trade in the Grand Rapids office, "They fall in love with my hands." 
Three years ago, the <ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION>'s office in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, opened its doors to on-site massage.
Last year, the research and development division of <ORGANIZATION>Weyerhaeuser Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the large wood-products concern, invited a masseuse to its <LOCATION>Tacoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, offices.
<PERSON>Russell Borner</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Park Ridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, says he has been working for the past year at a huge chemical and manufacturing concern in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> -- unbeknownst to the company's executives.
"This is common with a lot of large companies," says <PERSON>Mr. Borner</PERSON>, who worked for <ORGANIZATION>American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ORGANIZATION> for 23 years before choosing his current trade.
<PERSON>Elisa Byler</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> masseuse, won over officials at <ORGANIZATION>Emerson Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a maker of electrical and electronic equipment, by providing documents and other articles trumpeting the therapeutic benefits of massage.
"I pull my hair back, wear a little makeup and look corporate," says <PERSON>Ms. Byler</PERSON>, who has been visiting <ORGANIZATION>Emerson</ORGANIZATION> since January. "If I go in there as I normally dress, they'd ask, `Who is this hippie? '" 
The self-proclaimed father of on-site massage is <PERSON>David Palmer</PERSON>, a 41-year-old <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> masseur whose mission is to save the touch-starved masses.
To help do this, <PERSON>Mr. Palmer</PERSON> developed a portable massage chair three years ago that he hopes will bring "structured touching" into mainstream <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Palmer</PERSON>, who serves as president of the <ORGANIZATION>On-Site Massage Association</ORGANIZATION> and writes an industry newsletter, says some 4,000 practitioners -- out of about 50,000 certified masseurs across the country -- now use massage chairs in the workplace, as well as on street corners, in airports and malls, and at conventions and other gatherings where weary people can be found. 
<PERSON>Scot MacInnis</PERSON>, a masseur in <LOCATION>Boulder</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, had a scary experience while massaging a man in a natural-foods supermarket as part of a store promotion.
<PERSON>Linda Aldridge</PERSON>, who does full-body work in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>, says that while on-site massage is better than nothing, tired workers should realize it is only the tip of the iceberg. 
"Nothing traded on Friday, and people weren't really sure where the market should have opened" yesterday, said <PERSON>Raymond Minella</PERSON>, co-head of merchant banking at <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co.</ORGANIZATION> "But we had a fairly active day yesterday." 
At <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the leading underwriter of junk bonds, "I was prepared to be in a very bad mood tonight," said <PERSON>David Feinman</PERSON>, a junk bond trader. "Now, I feel maybe there's a little bit of euphoria." But before the stock market rebounded from a sharp early sell-off yesterday, he said, "You couldn't buy {junk bonds} and you couldn't give them away." 
Bonds issued by <PERSON>Kroger</PERSON>, <PERSON>Duracell</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Safeway</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>American Standard</ORGANIZATION> also showed big gains, recovering almost all their losses from Friday and early yesterday. 
"Liquidity hasn't returned to the vast middle ground of the market," said <PERSON>Mr. Minella</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Merrill</ORGANIZATION>. 
"The deadbeats are still deadbeats," said <PERSON>Mr. Feinman</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Paul Asquith</PERSON>, associate professor at the <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Sloan School of Management</ORGANIZATION>, citing a pattern of junk-bond default rates that are low in the early years after issuance and rise later, says, "We're now in a period where we're starting to see defaults from the big issue years of 1984 to 1986." 
<PERSON>Mark Bachmann</PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Standard & Poor's Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, confirms that there is "increasing concern about the future liquidity of the junk bond market." 
"Junk bonds are a highly stratified market," said <PERSON>Lewis Glucksman</PERSON>, vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.</ORGANIZATION> "There's a whole bunch of stuff that's money good and a whole bunch of stuff that's not so good." 
Almost $8 billion of junk bonds that are considered untradeable include issues from <ORGANIZATION>SCI</ORGANIZATION> TV, <ORGANIZATION>Gillette Holdings</ORGANIZATION> (not related to <ORGANIZATION>Gillette Co.</ORGANIZATION>), <ORGANIZATION>Interco</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Seaman Furniture</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Allied Stores</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Federated Department Stores</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>National Gypsum</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>M.D.C. Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Micropolis</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Leaseway Transportation and Price Communications</ORGANIZATION>. 
"Sometimes a shakeout is healthy," said <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Feinman</PERSON>. "People will learn to be more circumspect.
During the Korean War, Gen. <PERSON>Douglas MacArthur</PERSON> demanded and got, in addition to his <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> command in <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>, his own naval command in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>NavforJapan</ORGANIZATION>.
In 1941, <PERSON>Raeder</PERSON> and the <LOCATION>German</LOCATION> navy threatened to attack the <LOCATION>Panama Canal</LOCATION>, so we created the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Command</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Southern Command</ORGANIZATION> has grown even bigger since the war because <PERSON>Raeder</PERSON>'s ghost sometimes runs through the E ring dressed like Gen. <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Command</ORGANIZATION>'s huge bureaucracy is needed to analyze whether leaders of coups against Gen. <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> meet the War Powers Act's six points, <PERSON>Cap Weinberger</PERSON>'s seven points, the <ORGANIZATION>Intelligence Committee</ORGANIZATION>'s 32 points and <PERSON>Woodrow Wilson</PERSON>'s 14 points necessary to justify <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> support.
The ghost of the Soviet brigade discovered in <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> back in the '70s costs just a few hundred million: the price of the <ORGANIZATION>Caribbean Command</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Key West</LOCATION> that President <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> created in 1980.
The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> headquarters on the third deck of the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> used to burn a lot of incense to him, but the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> headquarters on the fourth deck made them stop it.
You see, <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> had this thing about the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> and the Marines -- he wanted to make them part of the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> but Secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>Navy James Forrestal</ORGANIZATION> blocked him.
To keep him quiet we invent a new unified command every year or so run by the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> and put more of the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Marines</ORGANIZATION> under it.
But we still hear him moaning at night because the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> has a few ships left, and to satisfy him the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>'s sea lift forces were given to a new <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> bureaucracy in <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, its space operations to another command in <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, the frogmen to a new <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> bureaucracy in <LOCATION>Fort Bragg</LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Indian Ocean</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> forces to an <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> bureaucracy in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. 
When the shah died, President <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> was so scared that the shah's ghost would blame him for shoving him out to make way for the ayatollah that he declared the <PERSON>Carter Doctrine</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr. Carter</PERSON> said he would go to war to stop anyone from trying to grab <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>.
So <PERSON>Mr. Carter</PERSON> formed three new <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> divisions and gave them to a new bureaucracy in <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION> called the <ORGANIZATION>Rapid Deployment Force</ORGANIZATION>.
After <PERSON>Mr. Carter</PERSON> was defeated in 1980, the shah's ghost claimed the credit and then went after President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Cap Weinberger</PERSON>.
Cap added four more divisions to the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>, two active and two reserve; two carrier groups to the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>; a division -- equivalent to the <ORGANIZATION>Marines</ORGANIZATION>; and the C-5B, KC-10, C-17 and a thousand tactical aircraft to the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION>.
He bought $4 billion in prepositioning ships and $7 billion in ammo and equipment to fill them, and parked them at a new $6 billion base at <LOCATION>Diego Garcia</LOCATION> in the middle of the <LOCATION>Indian Ocean</LOCATION>.
Before they let him go he added a thousand bureaucrats to the <ORGANIZATION>RDF</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION> and renamed it Central Command.
He gave those bureaucrats charge of all naval operations in the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Indian Ocean</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> figured it would be good training for those soldiers -- someday maybe they would get the whole <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>.
But the shah still kept leaping out at Cap, so Cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $7 billion of loading barges, ramps, etc., in order that those seven new <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> divisions and three <ORGANIZATION>Marine</ORGANIZATION> brigades could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the <LOCATION>Zagros</LOCATION> mountains. 
Then suddenly <PERSON>Ike</PERSON>'s ghost came to visit and said, "What the hell are you doing planning for a land war in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> 12,000 miles away?
So the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> found itself paying about $2 billion in baksheesh to various Arab potentates for basing rights around the <LOCATION>Indian Ocean</LOCATION>. 
But then it turned out that President <PERSON>Siad Barrah</PERSON> was not at all a nice person and the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> pointed out that the base he promised us in <LOCATION>Berbera</LOCATION> had silted up about a hundred years ago and anyway was 1,244 miles from the mouth of the <LOCATION>Gulf</LOCATION>. (But who's counting.) Still, <PERSON>Berbera</PERSON> was the best we could get, so we stay in bed with President <PERSON>Barrah</PERSON>.
Predictably, some <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> guys said: "Do we still need to keep all 18 <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> divisions on active duty and all those extra land-based aircraft without bases and all those <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> guys playing admiral in <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>?
And why not save the costs of a thousand bureaucrats by abolishing <ORGANIZATION>Central Command</ORGANIZATION> and putting responsibility for <LOCATION>Gulf</LOCATION> naval operations back where it belongs, afloat with the task force commander in the Gulf?
<PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> came clanking in like <PERSON>Marley</PERSON>'s ghost dragging those chains of brigades and air wings and links with <PERSON>Arab</PERSON> despots.
He wouldn't leave until <PERSON>Mr. Cheney</PERSON> promised to do whatever the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> systems analysts told him. 
So next day <PERSON>Mr. Cheney</PERSON> went out and did just that: He canceled the 600-ship <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> and cut back one carrier and 20 frigates.
<PERSON>Mr. Lehman</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Reagan Navy</ORGANIZATION> secretary, is a managing director of <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Robert D. Paster</PERSON>, 49 years old, vice president and <ORGANIZATION>Space Shuttle Main Engine</ORGANIZATION> program manager, was named president of the <ORGANIZATION>Rocketdyne</ORGANIZATION> division of this aerospace concern, succeeding <PERSON>Richard Schwartz</PERSON>, who resigned to become president of <ORGANIZATION>Hercules Aerospace Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Wilmington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Del</LOCATION>. 
"It was crazy," said <PERSON>Neil Weisman</PERSON>, general partner of <ORGANIZATION>Chilmark Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION> "It was like flying without a pilot in the front of the plane." 
<ORGANIZATION>Quotron Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> unit, blamed the 30-minute foul-up on "a timing problem in our software" caused by the enormous early volume -- about 145 million shares in the first hour of <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> trading.
<PERSON>Holly Stark</PERSON>, a vice president who heads the trading desk at <ORGANIZATION>Dillon Read Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said that once she figured out the Quotron numbers were wrong, she called brokers to tell them. "It's been kind of annoying, to say the least," she said.
To confuse matters further, when <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION> stock finally opened on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> at 11:08 a.m., the price was listed at $324.75 a share, up about $45 from Friday; in fact, its true price was $224.75, down $55. 
When the market opened at 9:30 a.m. EST, a reporter for the <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> newswire miscalculated the industrial average's drop as a 4% decline when it really was down 0.7%. "It was a case of human error, which we found almost immediately and corrected," a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Reuter</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> said. 
<PERSON>Quotron</PERSON> said that snafu, which lasted nine minutes, resulted from a failure to adjust for a 4-for-1 stock split at <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris Cos</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Nissan Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's Infiniti division likes to insist that every dealer construct and furnish a building in a <LOCATION>Japanese</LOCATION> style.
"Infiniti has it down to the ashtrays," says <PERSON>Jay Ferron</PERSON>, a partner at <ORGANIZATION>J.D. Power & Associates</ORGANIZATION>, an auto research firm. 
In <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>, for example, <PERSON>David Peterson</PERSON> has built a Lexus dealership with the showroom on the second floor. 
<PERSON>Lee Seidman</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> says Infiniti "was a bear on interiors" but at least let him retrofit an existing building -- without the stream.
<ORGANIZATION>Dictaphone Corp.</ORGANIZATION> was caught off guard in 1974 when its main competitor, <ORGANIZATION>Lanier Office Products of Japan</ORGANIZATION>, introduced a microcassette dictation recorder half the size of standard cassette devices.
By 1979, designers and engineers at <ORGANIZATION>Dictaphone</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Pitney Bowes</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, had produced a working model of a "picocassette" recorder. 
To date, says <PERSON>Emil Jachmann</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Dictaphone</ORGANIZATION> vice president, it has "broken even or shown a small loss." 
"It gave me great pride to see the inventor of the microcassette in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> look at the pico and shake his head and say `unbelievable, '" says <PERSON>Mr. Jachmann</PERSON>. 
The studies are on exhibit at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> this month and will travel to <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Institute of Design</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>. 
ONE DAY <PERSON>Carl Barrett</PERSON> of Mobile, <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, was raking some sycamore leaves, but the rake kept riding up over the piles.
So <PERSON>Mr. Barrett</PERSON>, then vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>Alabama Steamship Association</ORGANIZATION>, took a steel-toothed garden rake and taped it to the underside of a leaf rake about nine inches up.
One customer, <PERSON>Donald Blaggs</PERSON> of Mobile, says the <PERSON>Barrett Rake</PERSON> allowed him to do his lawn in 2 1/2 hours, two hours less than usual. 
<PERSON>Richard Mason</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Ames Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Parkersburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>W. Va.</LOCATION>, says the <PERSON>Barrett</PERSON> rake "makes sense," but it would be "tough" to explain to consumers. 
<PERSON>John Stoner</PERSON>, marketing director for <ORGANIZATION>True Temper Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Black & Decker</ORGANIZATION>, says people don't want to move a leaf pile. "They either pick it up," he says, "or they start pulling from a fresh direction." 
Odds and Ends NO MORE STUBBED toes or bruised shins, promises <ORGANIZATION>Geste Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Goshen</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION>, the designer of a bed support to replace traditional frames.
Four tubular steel "Bedfellows," each roughly in the shape of a "W," are attached to the bottom of the box spring in a recessed position. . . . Nearly half of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> consumers say they'll pay up to 5% more for packaging that can be recycled or is biodegradable, according to a survey commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION>Michael Peters Group</ORGANIZATION>, a design consultant. 
<ORGANIZATION>General Dynamics Services Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>General Dynamics Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, won a $48.2 million <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> contract to establish maintenance facilities for tracked vehicles in <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Grumman Corp.</ORGANIZATION> was given a $15 million <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> contract for aircraft-electronics improvements. 
<ORGANIZATION>Hughes Aircraft Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, got a $10.3 million <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> contract for airborne-radar equipment. 
Closely held <ORGANIZATION>Intelligence in Education</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>Larchmont</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, is an educational publisher and consultant. 
But opponents fear overcrowding. "This city already has too many tourists, and it can't hold them all," says <PERSON>Pierluigi Beggiato</PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION>Venice hoteliers association</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>C. Olivetti & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, have formed a consortium to lobby for holding the expo in <LOCATION>Venice</LOCATION>. 
The three establishments -- two in <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION>Krakow</LOCATION> -- accept only foreign currency and are joint ventures between Polish firms and Western companies.
But <PERSON>Bogdan Gumkowski</PERSON>, who runs the casino at <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Marriott Hotel</ORGANIZATION>, said the ventures would help <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> service its $39 billion foreign debt by pouring dollars into the state firms in the joint ventures -- the <ORGANIZATION>LOT</ORGANIZATION> airline and Orbis tourist organization. 
<LOCATION>Algeria</LOCATION> plans to increase natural-gas sales to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> According to the Middle East Economic Survey, the North African nation is holding talks with <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> for adding a fourth pipe to a section of the Trans-Mediterranean pipeline, expanding capacity by up to six billion cubic meters a year from 12.5 billion.
<LOCATION>Algeria</LOCATION> also wants to build a pipeline through <LOCATION>Morocco</LOCATION> and across the <LOCATION>Strait of Gibraltar</LOCATION> to supply <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> with up to 15 billion cubic meters a year by the late 1990s. 
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Union of Mineworkers</ORGANIZATION> agreed to suspend the strike by diamond workers and resume negotiations with <ORGANIZATION>De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> over their wage dispute, <PERSON>De Beers</PERSON> said.
The strike at five De Beers mines began last Thursday, with 9,500 out of a total 10,000 <ORGANIZATION>NUM</ORGANIZATION> members employed on De Beers mines participating, according to the union, while <PERSON>De Beers</PERSON> said there were 7,800 participants.
A 35-nation environmental conference opened in <LOCATION>Sofia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Bulgaria</LOCATION>.
West German Environment Minister <PERSON>Klaus Toepfer</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> is convinced of the need for cooperation, "especially with our neighbors in the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION>, because we are directly affected by their ecological progress or lack of it." The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> joined every European country except <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION> at the meeting. 
<PERSON>Angel Gurria</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s top debt negotiator, said the country's creditor banks are responding positively to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s debt-reduction package. 
<PERSON>Mr. Gurria</PERSON>'s optimism contrasts with some bankers' views that the deal may require a lot of arm twisting by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Treasury</ORGANIZATION> in order to succeed.
<PERSON>Mr. Gurria</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s under-secretary of the ministry of finance, met yesterday with European bankers in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, at the half-way point on a so-called road show to market the package around the world. 
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s top film actress, <PERSON>Liu Xiaoqing</PERSON>, paid $4,555 in back taxes and fines in <LOCATION>Shandong</LOCATION> province, the <ORGANIZATION>People's Daily</ORGANIZATION> reported.
The amount is equal to about 30 years earnings for the average peasant, who makes $145 a year. . . . <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> will spend $9.45 million for urgent maintenance on <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Potala Palace</PERSON>, former home of the <PERSON>Dalai Lama</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>China News Service</ORGANIZATION> said.
The <PERSON>Dalai Lama</PERSON>, who was just awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, lives in exile in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. 
In early trading in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Tuesday, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> currency was changing hands at about 142.15 yen, up from <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s Monday close of 140.74 yen, and at about 1.8665 marks, down a bit from late trading Monday in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
"Trading in dollar/mark looked like the Dow's shadow, to a point," said <PERSON>Jeffrey M. Mondschein</PERSON>, managing director in charge of foreign-exchange operations at <ORGANIZATION>Continental Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>.
"If you take away the stock-market brouhaha of the last few days, you still have lower {<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>} interest rates, lower {<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>} capacity utilization, and concern about quarterly earnings and general economic strength -- or lack thereof," said <PERSON>Mr. Mondschein</PERSON>, "so you wonder what the level of the dollar should be." 
But the real fireworks began in <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> and early <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> activity where traders were whipsawed by an inaccurate report of the stock market's opening and a statement by <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Board</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Alan Greenspan</PERSON>. 
A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> confirmed there was an error and that it was quickly corrected. 
Nonetheless, <PERSON>Peter Stein</PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION>Commerzbank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, said: "It's crazy; it's absolute madness." 
Later, news wires reported that <PERSON>Mr. Greenspan</PERSON> said a speech he delivered last week in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> had been misinterpreted.
At the time, many traders took it to be a signal that the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> wouldn't lower interest rates to weaken the dollar, and that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> was at odds with its major trading partners in seeking to stabilize a high-flying <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> currency at a lower level. 
The dollar promptly fell nearly two pfennig to 1.8560. "It was up and down, up and down, up and down," said <PERSON>Marcus Croonen</PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION>DG Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>. "It was a bad day." 
<PERSON>Roberto Bianchi</PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Union Bank of Switzerland</ORGANIZATION>, described the market's mood as confused. "Everybody keeps repeating that it's OK, it's not the same as 1987, the central banks stand ready to stabilize the market, and yet there is a lot of uncertainty." 
Yet <PERSON>Heiko Thieme</PERSON>, an investment strategist for <ORGANIZATION>Deutsche Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, contended that Europeans hadn't purchased many American shares this year.
He expects the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade deficit to keep improving and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economy to expand at 2% to 2.5% next year. 
Thus, with little risk of losing profits through a deteriorating currency, "what you have here is a unique buying opportunity," said <PERSON>Mr. Thieme</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stock market. 
<PERSON>George Kuster</PERSON>, a manager at <ORGANIZATION>Gulf & Occidental Investment S.A.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION>, agrees but only to a point.
Nonetheless, <PERSON>Mr. Kuster</PERSON> added: "I don't trust the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market that much" because of the dollar's volatility. "My clients lost a lot of money in the 1970s because of the dollar, so I can afford not to gain" from <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> equities.
On the <ORGANIZATION>Commodity Exchange</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, gold for current delivery rose $4 to $367.30 an ounce in moderate trading.
The Dow Jones industrials rose 3.4%. "Bids were lowered too much," said <PERSON>Gary Rosenbach</PERSON>, a market maker and manager of equity trading at <ORGANIZATION>Needham & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
On Friday, the market makers, who must be prepared to buy stock when no one else will, were frantically cutting the prices at which they would take stocks off sellers' hands, in reaction to plunging prices on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, according to <PERSON>Mr. Rosenbach</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Joseph Hardiman</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Securities Dealers</ORGANIZATION>, which oversees trading on <ORGANIZATION>Nasdaq</ORGANIZATION>, said that between 9 a.m. and 9:30 a.m., the market's Small Order Execution System was deluged with six times the normal volume of quotation updates from market makers and had to be shut down for nearly 25 minutes after trading began so computers could digest the data. 
They said it was reasonable to expect a rash of selling and to lower prices in anticipation of it. "Market makers saw sell orders first and that's why they (lowered bids)," said <PERSON>Brian Finnerty</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton</ORGANIZATION> market maker. "The buyers sat back and didn't come in until a half hour or 45 minutes later." 
E.E. "Buzzy" <PERSON>Geduld</PERSON>, president of <PERSON>Herzog</PERSON>, <PERSON>Heine</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Geduld</LOCATION>, a giant market-making firm, said, "Stocks looked ugly at 9:30.
But <ORGANIZATION>Sun Microsystems</ORGANIZATION> eased 1/4 to 17 1/4 on 3.6 million shares and <ORGANIZATION>Lotus Development</ORGANIZATION> was unchanged at 29 7/8. 
<ORGANIZATION>National Pizza</ORGANIZATION> also said it settled its dispute with PepsiCo's <ORGANIZATION>Pizza Hut</ORGANIZATION> unit that had threatened to scuttle the proposed acquisition.
<ORGANIZATION>McCaw Cellular Communications</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>LIN</ORGANIZATION> suitor, rose 1 1/4 to 41 1/4. 
The stock rose after <PERSON>Grayhound</PERSON> said it agreed to enter into a five-year joint venture with <ORGANIZATION>Lermer Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a maker of airline-interior equipment. 
<ORGANIZATION>Polaroid Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's patent-infringement damages case against <ORGANIZATION>Eastman Kodak Co.</ORGANIZATION>, one of the highest stakes corporate trials ever, is getting scant attention on Wall Street. 
The highest patent damage award to date was in 1986, when <ORGANIZATION>Smith International Inc.</ORGANIZATION> was ordered to pay $205 million to <ORGANIZATION>Baker Hughes Inc.</ORGANIZATION> for infringing on a patent on an oil drilling bit seal.
You might find something, but the chances are low," said <PERSON>Michael Ellman</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Wertheim Schroder & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
And <PERSON>Eugene Glazer</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said: "If you hired an attorney to be there all the time and give you a (prediction) of the eventual award, I would be willing to bet that he would be off" by a lot. 
A 75-day trial in the early 1980s determined that <LOCATION>Kodak</LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION>Rochester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, infringed on patents of <LOCATION>Polaroid</LOCATION>, of <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>.
Two analysts who have read the transcripts, <PERSON>David Nelson</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Calvert D. Crary</PERSON>, a litigation analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Labe, Simpson & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, think <PERSON>Judge A. David Mazzone</PERSON> will decide in <LOCATION>Kodak</LOCATION>'s favor on the "willful and deliberate" issue. 
<PERSON>Mr. Crary</PERSON> said testimony by <PERSON>Kodak</PERSON>'s patent counsel, <PERSON>Francis T. Carr</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Kenyon & Kenyon</ORGANIZATION>, showed that "he worked with <PERSON>Kodak</PERSON> continuously from the outset of the project" in an effort to avoid infringement. "<PERSON>Carr</PERSON> told <PERSON>Kodak</PERSON> on many occasions to avoid various features because of <LOCATION>Polaroid</LOCATION>'s patent positions," and <PERSON>Kodak</PERSON> followed his advice in every instance, <PERSON>Mr. Crary</PERSON> said. 
But <PERSON>Irving Kayton</PERSON>, a patent expert at <ORGANIZATION>George Mason University School of Law</ORGANIZATION> who is familiar with the case, said the fact that seven patents were infringed "suggests that infringement was willful.
Observers also wonder whether <PERSON>Judge Mazzone</PERSON> will use the lost-profits method of determining damages, which <LOCATION>Polaroid</LOCATION> favors because it would result in a larger award, or the reasonable royalty method.
Polaroid claims it could have manufactured and sold all the instant cameras and film sold by <PERSON>Kodak</PERSON> if <PERSON>Kodak</PERSON> hadn't entered the market.
Moreover, <PERSON>Polaroid</PERSON> contends it could have sold them at a higher price -- and thus made higher profits -- because it wouldn't have been forced to match <PERSON>Kodak</PERSON>'s lower prices. 
<ORGANIZATION>Kodak</ORGANIZATION> hired <PERSON>Robert Buzzell</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Polaroid</LOCATION> brought in <PERSON>Robert J. Dolan</PERSON>. "There's nothing that says that people at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard Business</ORGANIZATION> school have to agree with each other," said <PERSON>Mr. Buzzell</PERSON>. 
Excluding the British snack-food business acquired in July, snack-food international tonnage jumped 40%, with sales strong in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>.
Led by <PERSON>Pizza Hut</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Taco Bell</ORGANIZATION>, restaurant earnings increased about 25% in the third quarter on a 22% sales increase.
The new product has performed well in a market test in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Calloway</PERSON> said. 
After a four-year, $7.7 billion acquisition binge that brought a major soft-drink company, soda bottlers, a fast-food chain and an overseas snack-food giant to <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Calloway</PERSON> said he doesn't expect any major acquisition in the next year or so.
The offering for the language school unit was announced by <PERSON>Robert Maxwell</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of London-based <ORGANIZATION>Maxwell Communication Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION>Macmillan</ORGANIZATION>. 
After the offering is completed, <ORGANIZATION>Macmillan</ORGANIZATION> will own about 56% of the <LOCATION>Berlitz</LOCATION> common stock outstanding.
Five million shares will be offered in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, and 3.4 million additional shares will be offered in concurrent international offerings outside the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ORGANIZATION> will manage the offering. 
<ORGANIZATION>Macmillan</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Berlitz</PERSON> intends to pay quarterly dividends on the stock.
Proceeds from the borrowings under the credit agreement will be used to pay an $80 million cash dividend to <ORGANIZATION>Macmillan</ORGANIZATION> and to lend the remainder of about $128 million to <ORGANIZATION>Maxwell Communications</ORGANIZATION> in connection with a promissory note. 
<LOCATION>Berlitz</LOCATION>, which is based in <LOCATION>Princeton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, provides language instruction and translation services through more than 260 language centers in 25 countries.
In the past five years, more than 68% of its sales have been outside the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Macmillan</ORGANIZATION> has owned <LOCATION>Berlitz</LOCATION> since 1966. 
That compared with the year-earlier $1.25 billion, or $2.10 a share -- which was inflated by a 15-cents-a-share gain from the sale of some <ORGANIZATION>MCI Communications Corp.</ORGANIZATION> stock and by an unspecified amount from a payment by <ORGANIZATION>Fujitsu Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> relating to a software dispute.
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Armonk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, remained upbeat.
The computer giant, whose <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> results have been dismal for years, noted that revenue rose again in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in the third quarter, following an increase in the second period.
Securities analysts, however, remained downbeat. "I think 1990 will be another mediocre year," said <PERSON>Steve Milunovich</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Jay Stevens</PERSON> of <PERSON>Dean Witter</PERSON> actually cut his per-share earnings estimate to $9 from $9.50 for 1989 and to $9.50 from $10.35 in 1990 because he decided sales would be even weaker than he had expected.
"A key part of the question is, how soon does this disk-drive come and how soon does production ramp up?" said <PERSON>Steve Cohen</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>SoundView Financial Group</ORGANIZATION>. "And the input I've had from customers is that it still could be a while." 
On leasing, <PERSON>Bob Djurdjevic</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Annex Research</ORGANIZATION> said he thinks <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> has hurt itself unnecessarily.
<PERSON>Bob Bardagy</PERSON>, executive vice president of marketing at <ORGANIZATION>Comdisco Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a huge leasing firm, said: "To put it mildly, <ORGANIZATION>IBM Credit</ORGANIZATION> has been doing some of the worst economic deals of any leasing company we have ever seen." 
In addition, <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>'s growth in software in the third quarter was just 8.8%, well below historical levels even when adjusted to reflect last year's payment from <ORGANIZATION>Fujitsu</ORGANIZATION> and the stronger dollar.
For one thing, there is an old master on the wall -- "Samuel Anointing <PERSON>David</PERSON>," a big baroque canvas painted by <PERSON>Mattia Preti</PERSON>, a 17th-century Neapolitan. 
The collection was at the heart of a grandiose plan <PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> had in which the art was to do double duty -- as an investment for <ORGANIZATION>CenTrust</ORGANIZATION> and as decoration for the S&L's new office tower, designed by <PERSON>I.M. Pei</PERSON>.
Besides that, some of the paintings that were to grace the walls of <ORGANIZATION>CenTrust</ORGANIZATION> actually ended up hanging in the chairman's estate on <ORGANIZATION>La Gorce</ORGANIZATION> Isle off <LOCATION>Miami Beach</LOCATION>. 
The acquisitions, officials said in a letter to <PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON>, were "unsafe, unsound and unauthorized." So far, <PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> has unloaded but three of his masterpieces, he won't say to whom.
"It's not like selling Chevrolets," <PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> says, as he takes a drag on a goldbanded <LOCATION>St. Moritz</LOCATION> cigarette. "The last six months has established the quality of the collection.
Despite <PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON>'s characteristic hauteur, the 50-year-old, chain-smoking dynamo is finding that getting CenTrust -- <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s largest thrift institution -- out of its riskiest investments is much tougher than getting into them had been.
<PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> has a plan to bring in $150 million by selling off 63 of <ORGANIZATION>CenTrust</ORGANIZATION>'s 71 branches, but it has yet to be approved by regulators. 
Embittered shareholders (some of whom are suing) say the chairman and his collection epitomize the excesses of speculation that set off the national S&L crisis. (<ORGANIZATION>CenTrust</ORGANIZATION> shares have fallen sharply in price from a high of $15.125 in 1986 to close yesterday at $2.875.) Gallery directors, meanwhile, say <PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> and others of his ilk have left an indelible mark on the art world -- and not for the better. 
Collectors don't say "It's a van Gogh" anymore, laments <PERSON>Harry Brooks</PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION>Wildenstein & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> gallery. "They say, `<PERSON>Johnny Payson</PERSON> got $53 million for his, so certainly $10 million isn't too much for mine. ' The great collectors we depended on, such as <PERSON>Paul Mellon</PERSON> or <PERSON>Norton Simon</PERSON>, have stopped buying, and the new buyers are brilliant men who made money in the stock market or in takeovers and rushed into collecting. . . ." <PERSON>Mr. Payson</PERSON>, an art dealer and collector, sold <PERSON>Vincent van Gogh</PERSON>'s "Irises" at a <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s auction in November 1987 to <LOCATION>Australian</LOCATION> businessman <PERSON>Alan Bond</PERSON>. (Trouble is, <PERSON>Mr. Bond</PERSON> has yet to pay up, and until he does, <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s has the painting under lock and key.) 
When <PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> moved in on the art market, he let it be known that virtually no piece was too costly to be considered by <ORGANIZATION>CenTrust</ORGANIZATION>. 
He established his reputation as a freespender in January last year at <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s auction of the <LOCATION>Linda</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Gerald Guterman</PERSON> collection in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
The rest were withdrawn for lack of acceptable bids.) Afterward, <PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> is said by <PERSON>Mr. Guterman</PERSON> to have phoned <PERSON>Mr. Guterman</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> developer selling the collection, and gloated. 
"He says he `stole them, '" recalls <PERSON>Mr. Guterman</PERSON>. "And he tells me, `If you want to see your paintings, you'll have to come to my house in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. '" <PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> denies phoning and gloating. "It's just not true," he says. 
<PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> quickly became more aggressive in his collecting, with the help of <PERSON>George Wachter</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s expert in old masters whom he met at an exhibition of the Guterman items.
<PERSON>Mr. Wachter</PERSON>, who became his principal adviser, searched galleries in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Monaco</ORGANIZATION>.
And, according to one dealer, <PERSON>Mr. Wachter</PERSON> had a penchant for introducing <PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> with the phrase: "He can buy anything." 
<PERSON>Nicholas Hall</PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION>Colnaghi U.S.A. Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> gallery in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, sold <PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> "Abraham and <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> in the Wilderness" by <PERSON>Giovanni Battista Tiepolo</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr. Hall</PERSON> says <PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> "was known to spend a lot of money.
<PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> thus developed a close, symbiotic relationship with <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> was eager to assemble a collection for the headquarters <ORGANIZATION>CenTrust</ORGANIZATION> has been moving into for the greater part of a year.
Sotheby's, the auction house founded in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> 1744 and now under the umbrella of <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, was hoping to stir up interest in old masters as it strove to build its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> business.
European dealers continued to dominate the action in old masters, which <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> had lately been touting in this country. 
Last October, <PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> paid out $12 million of <ORGANIZATION>CenTrust</ORGANIZATION>'s cash -- plus a $1.2 million commission -- for "Portrait of a Man as Mars." The painting, attributed to <LOCATION>Flemish</LOCATION> artist <PERSON>Peter Paul Rubens</PERSON>, was purchased privately through <PERSON>Sotheby</PERSON>'s, not at auction. 
The art collection might have come to rival the <ORGANIZATION>Medicis</ORGANIZATION>' had the <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> comptroller's office not got wind of <PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON>'s aesthetic adventure. 
The state gave <ORGANIZATION>CenTrust</ORGANIZATION> 30 days to sell the <ORGANIZATION>Rubens</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> says that at one point he did indeed have eight or nine of the paintings at home and that the rest were in storage at <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's</ORGANIZATION>.
It came on the heels of a number of local newspaper articles suggesting that <PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> has benefited handsomely from his association with <ORGANIZATION>CenTrust</ORGANIZATION>.
Adding to <PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON>'s problems, dealers (some with vested interests) insist that he, relying rather too heavily on <PERSON>Sotheby</PERSON>'s advice, paid much too much for several pieces in the CenTrust collection.
<PERSON>David Tunick</PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION>David Tunick Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> gallery, says scholars question the authenticity of the Rubens.
<PERSON>Victor Wiener</PERSON>, the executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Appraisers Association of America</ORGANIZATION>, agrees that <PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> paid very dearly for the <PERSON>Rubens</PERSON> and adds that getting rid of it any time soon for a similar sum would be quite a feat. "It's not beyond credibility the <ORGANIZATION>Rubens</ORGANIZATION> will someday be worth $12 million, but whether it could be sold for that amount tomorrow remains to be seen." 
<PERSON>Jonathan H. Kress</PERSON>, the son of the painting's former owner, <PERSON>Mrs. Rush Kress</PERSON>, dismisses the price talk as "sour grapes." Dealers contemptuous of the purchase price, he says, were themselves interested in buying the <LOCATION>Rubens</LOCATION> but lost out. 
<ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the investment-banking firm, in its annual tally of investment returns, reported that old masters appreciated 51% in the year ended June 1, the greatest return of any of 13 assets it tracked. (Impressionist and modern paintings, not tracked by <ORGANIZATION>Salomon</ORGANIZATION>, are ranked even higher at 74% by <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's</ORGANIZATION>.) 
<ORGANIZATION>Salomon</ORGANIZATION>, moreover, gets its data on art appreciation from <LOCATION>Sotheby</LOCATION>'s, whose prices go up with clients like <PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> in its thrall.
In January, the <LOCATION>Preti</LOCATION> painting that now hangs at <ORGANIZATION>CenTrust</ORGANIZATION> was expected to bring no more than $700,000 at auction until <PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> came along with his $1.15 million. 
<PERSON>Mr. Hall</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Colnaghi</LOCATION> gallery says $1.15 million "would have been an impossible price for anyone to ask for a <LOCATION>Preti</LOCATION> four years ago." But from his vantage point, it isn't that <PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON>, a customer of his too, overpaid for the work, "a gargantuan painting by an artist who is not a household word." (The painting is 10 feet wide, seven feet high.) Rather, "It just shows things have changed." 
Everybody was out buying Monets." <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s vice president <PERSON>Diana Levitt</PERSON> says the auction house has been "assisting" <PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> in selling the paintings.
And while <PERSON>Sotheby</PERSON>'s chief rivals in the art world, private art dealers, "won't be happy to hear it," she adds, "a number of {the artworks} have already been sold, and at a substantial profit." <PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> claims to have sold three paintings, at more than a 10% profit.
He furthermore denies that he relied too heavily on <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s or <PERSON>Mr. Wachter</PERSON>.
But in art-world parlance, <PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON>'s holdings are "burnt." That is, he is being compelled to put them on the market too soon, and has already gotten offers that are less than he paid for some of the art works. "After a few years, you can argue there has been natural appreciation," says <PERSON>Susan Theran</PERSON>, the publisher of <PERSON>Leonard</PERSON>'s Annual Price Index of <ORGANIZATION>Art Auctions</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Wachter</PERSON> says <PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> was a quick study who worked intensely and bought the best pictures available at the moment. "On occasion, he paid a high price," <PERSON>Mr. Wachter</PERSON> concedes, but he says those who bid less and dropped out were dealers who would then have marked up the paintings to resell them at a profit to collectors. 
<PERSON>Naomi Bernhard Levinson</PERSON>, a fine-arts appraiser at <ORGANIZATION>Bernhard Associates</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, considers it "definite conflict of interest for an auction house to both advise a client on purchases and to set price estimates on the paintings to be purchased." Sotheby's, she says, is "wearing both hats." 
"I can't see why there would be a conflict of interest," says <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Ms. Levitt</PERSON>. "Estimates are based on the previous price of similar works sold at auction and current market conditions, and are not affected by any knowledge of who the potential buyer could be." Frequently, clients express interest in paintings but don't end up bidding, she adds, "so we don't know who the potential buyer will be." 
<PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> says that he has feelers out over much of the globe and that potential buyers from as far away as <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> have examined the collection. 
One dealer, <ORGANIZATION>Martin Zimet of French & Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, says he "would have loved to buy" a <PERSON>Jan Davids de Heem</PERSON> painting from the bank. "I tried to steal the picture -- to buy it attractively -- and {<ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s} wouldn't do it.
Meanwhile, <PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>CenTrust</ORGANIZATION> executives are getting squeamish about opulence.
<PERSON>Mr. Paul</PERSON> has been characterized as "the <PERSON>Great Gatsby</PERSON> or something," complains <PERSON>Karen E. Brinkman</PERSON>, an executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION>CenTrust</ORGANIZATION>.
He retains his current positions as chief strategic officer of <ORGANIZATION>AM International</ORGANIZATION> and president of <ORGANIZATION>AM Ventures</ORGANIZATION>. 
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> chose <PERSON>Martin Allday</PERSON>, a longtime friend from <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, to be chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Allday</PERSON> would succeed <PERSON>Martha Hesse</PERSON>, who is resigning.
The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Ms. Hesse</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> businesswoman who previously held posts at the <ORGANIZATION>Energy Department</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>FERC</ORGANIZATION>, is leaving to become a vice president of <ORGANIZATION>First Chicago Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Allday</PERSON>, an attorney in <LOCATION>Midland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, has been solicitor at the <ORGANIZATION>Interior Department</ORGANIZATION>.
He met <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> in the 1950s, when the president was a young oil man in <LOCATION>Midland</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Mr. Allday</PERSON> was a lawyer for an oil firm. 
<PERSON>Mr. Allday</PERSON>'s appointment is subject to confirmation by the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
<LOCATION>BRIDGEPORT</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION> - <PERSON>Christopher Kimball</PERSON>, founder, president and publisher of <PERSON>Cook</PERSON>'s magazine, said he is leaving the magazine by year end to launch a new men's consumer magazine. 
<PERSON>Mr. Kimball</PERSON> started <PERSON>Cook</PERSON>'s, a glossy epicurean magazine, in 1979 and it was purchased in 1983 by the <ORGANIZATION>New Yorker Magazine</ORGANIZATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>New Yorker</ORGANIZATION>'s parent, <ORGANIZATION>Advance Publications Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, sold it to <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Bonnier Magazine Group</ORGANIZATION> in 1986.
The magazine is now published by <ORGANIZATION>Pennington Publishing</ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <LOCATION>Bonnier</LOCATION> based in <LOCATION>Bridgeport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>The Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION> that day said <ORGANIZATION>Bausch & Lomb</ORGANIZATION> could start selling them in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
<ORGANIZATION>Bausch & Lomb</ORGANIZATION> sold the softies under a sublicense from <ORGANIZATION>National Patent Development</ORGANIZATION>, which had gained the rights from the <ORGANIZATION>Czechoslovakia Academy of Sciences</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Otto Wichterle</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Czech</LOCATION>, invented them in 1962. 
Last month the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Contact Lens Institute</ORGANIZATION> cautioned users that serious eye infections could result from wearing lenses more than seven days at a stretch. 
Although <PERSON>Bausch</PERSON> remains the leader among the six majors, <ORGANIZATION>Johnson & Johnson</ORGANIZATION>, with its new disposables, is coming on fast. 
<PERSON>G. William Ryan</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Post-Newsweek Stations</ORGANIZATION>, was named chief executive officer of the unit of this media company, effective Jan. 1.
He will succeed <PERSON>Joel Chaseman</PERSON>, who will remain a vice president of the company and continue to represent <ORGANIZATION>Post-Newsweek</ORGANIZATION> stations in several industry organizations, the company said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION> won a pretrial order blocking <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales of <ORGANIZATION>Justin Products Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's "My Own" line of portable audio players for children. 
Judge <PERSON>John E. Sprizzo</PERSON> issued the order in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> federal court, where <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> has accused the tiny company of illegally knocking off the "My First <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>" line.
The judge held that the combination of colors used for the <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> products is distinctive and subject to protection under <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> state law, rather than federal law.
<PERSON>Justin</PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON>Charles E. Baxley</PERSON>, said <PERSON>Justin</PERSON> would ask an appeals court to set aside the order temporarily, pending an expedited appeal.
He also repeated <PERSON>Justin</PERSON>'s denial of <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>'s charges. 
"Their likelihood of reversing us is very slim," said <PERSON>Lewis H. Eslinger</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>'s attorney, who said he doubts <ORGANIZATION>Justin</ORGANIZATION> will go ahead with a trial. 
<PERSON>Hydro-Quebec</PERSON> said it notified <ORGANIZATION>Central Maine Power Co.</ORGANIZATION> it will cancel a $4 billion contract to supply electricity to the <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> utility. 
The provincially owned utility said it is tearing up the deal because "the contract's objectives can't be fulfilled." <ORGANIZATION>Hydro-Quebec</ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> regulators' refusal to approve the contract earlier this year halted work on transmission lines and stopped negotiations for resale of electricity carried through <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> to other utilities. "It would now be physically impossible to begin deliveries in 1992," a <ORGANIZATION>Hydro-Quebec</ORGANIZATION> official said.
Under the contract <ORGANIZATION>Hydro-Quebec</ORGANIZATION> was to supply 400 megawatts of power to <ORGANIZATION>Central Maine Power</ORGANIZATION> starting in 1992, 600 megawatts starting in 1995 and 900 megawatts starting in 
<ORGANIZATION>Hydro-Quebec</ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> regulators' refusal to approve the contract means <ORGANIZATION>Central Maine Power</ORGANIZATION> has lost its place in line. "We won't sign any new contracts {with deliveries} beginning earlier than 2000," the <ORGANIZATION>Hydro-Quebec</ORGANIZATION> official said.
He said <ORGANIZATION>Hydro-Quebec</ORGANIZATION> already has some "customers in mind" for the power that was to be delivered to <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>. "Nothing has happened since we signed the contract to undermine our conviction that Hydro-Quebec was the lowest-cost, most environmentally acceptable choice for meeting a part of our customers' energy needs through the year 2020," said <LOCATION>Central Maine</LOCATION> senior vice president <PERSON>Donald F. Kelly</PERSON>. 
Central <PERSON>Maine</PERSON> said it is evaluating "many energy options" to make up for the lost future power, including new energy generation and management proposals from <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>, and possibly new Canadian purchases. 
As president, <PERSON>Mr. Lung</PERSON>, 42 years old, succeeds his father, <PERSON>Mervin D. Lung</PERSON>, 66, who founded the company in 1959.
<PERSON>David Lung</PERSON> has been with <PERSON>Patrick</PERSON> since 1970, and has served as vice president for administration and purchasing since 1987. 
<PERSON>Honeywell</PERSON> said it is negotiating the sale of a second stake in <ORGANIZATION>Yamatake-Honeywell</ORGANIZATION>, but indicated it intends to hold at least 20% of the joint venture's stock long term.
A 20% stake would allow <ORGANIZATION>Honeywell</ORGANIZATION> to include <ORGANIZATION>Yamatake</ORGANIZATION> earnings in its results. 
<ORGANIZATION>Honeywell</ORGANIZATION> said its <ORGANIZATION>Defense and Marine Systems</ORGANIZATION> group incurred delays in shipping some undisclosed contracts during the third quarter, resulting in lower operating profit for that business. 
<PERSON>George W. Koch</PERSON>, 63 years old, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Grocery Manufacturers of America Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, was elected a director of this maker of spices, seasonings and specialty foods, succeeding <PERSON>Erskin N. White Jr.</PERSON>, 65, who resigned. 
But the music has its charm, and <PERSON>Mr. Glass</PERSON> has constructed his solo program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex. "Opening" (1981), from <LOCATION>Glassworks</LOCATION>, introduces the audience to the Glass technique: Never straying too far from the piano's center, <PERSON>Mr. Glass</PERSON> works in the two octaves on either side of middle C, and his fingers seldom leave the keys.
With "Planet News," music meant to accompany readings of <PERSON>Allen Ginsberg</PERSON>'s "Wichita Vortex Sutra," <PERSON>Mr. Glass</PERSON> gets going.
Not only is the typical <ORGANIZATION>Glasswork</ORGANIZATION> open-ended, it is also often multiple in its context(s). "Mad Rush" began its life as the accompaniment to the <PERSON>Dalai Lama</PERSON>'s first public address in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, when <PERSON>Mr. Glass</PERSON> played it on the organ at <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s Cathedral of <LOCATION>St. John</LOCATION> the Divine.
Later it was performed on <ORGANIZATION>Radio Bremen</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, and then <PERSON>Lucinda Childs</PERSON> took it for one of her dance pieces.
Parts 1, 2, and 5 come from the soundtrack of <ORGANIZATION>Errol Morris</ORGANIZATION>'s acclaimed film, "The Thin Blue Line," and the two other parts from incidental music to two separate dramatizations of the <LOCATION>Kafka</LOCATION> story of the same name.
Admirers of <PERSON>Mr. Glass</PERSON> may agree with the critic <PERSON>Richard Kostelanetz</PERSON>'s sense that the 1974 "Music in Twelve Parts" is as encyclopedic and weighty as "The Well-Tempered Clavier." But while making the obvious point that both composers develop variations from themes, this comparison ignores the intensely claustrophobic nature of <PERSON>Mr. Glass</PERSON>'s music.
Its supposedly austere minimalism overlays a bombast that makes one yearn for the astringency of neoclassical <PERSON>Stravinsky</PERSON>, the genuinely radical minimalism of <LOCATION>Berg</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Webern</LOCATION>, and what in retrospect even seems like concision in <LOCATION>Mahler</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Spiegelman</PERSON> is professor of English at <ORGANIZATION>Southern Methodist University</ORGANIZATION> and editor of the <ORGANIZATION>Southwest Review</ORGANIZATION>. 
The violent temblor, which lasted about 15 seconds and registered 6.9 on the <PERSON>Richter</PERSON> scale, also caused the collapse of a 30-foot section of the <LOCATION>San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge</LOCATION> and shook Candlestick Park.
The tremor was centered near <LOCATION>Hollister</LOCATION>, southeast of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, and was felt as far as 200 miles away.
The quake, which also caused damage in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, knocked out electricity and telephones, cracked roadways and disrupted subway service in the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> vowed to veto a bill allowing federal financing for abortions in cases of rape and incest, saying tax dollars shouldn't be used to "compound a violent act with the taking of an unborn life." His pledge, in a letter to Democratic <PERSON>Sen. Byrd</PERSON>, came ahead of an expected <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> vote on spending legislation containing the provision. 
<LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>'s Politburo met amid speculation that the ruling body would oust hard-line leader <PERSON>Honecker</PERSON>, whose rule has been challenged by mass emigration and calls for democratic freedoms.

<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> met with South Korean President <PERSON>Roh</PERSON>, who indicated that <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> plans to further ease trade rules to ensure that its economy becomes as open as the other industrialized nations by the mid-1990s.
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> assured <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> would stand by its security commitments "as long as there is a threat" from <LOCATION>Communist North Korea</LOCATION>. 
The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration is seeking an understanding with <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to ease restrictions on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> involvement in foreign coups that might result in the death of a country's leader.
A <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said that while <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> wouldn't alter a longstanding ban on such involvement, "there's a clarification needed" on its interpretation.

<PERSON>Christie</PERSON>'s and <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's</ORGANIZATION>, the two major <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> houses, are about to offer a large number of impressionist and modern paintings at estimates unheard of even five years ago.
This season <ORGANIZATION>Lorinda de Roulet</ORGANIZATION> (sister of <PERSON>John Whitney Payson</PERSON>, for whom "Irises" by <PERSON>Vincent van Gogh</PERSON> was sold for $53.9 million in November of 1987, to the <LOCATION>Australian Alan Bond</LOCATION>, who still hasn't taken possession because he hasn't yet paid off the loan <PERSON>Sotheby</PERSON>'s offered him at the sale) has consigned another biggie to <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's</ORGANIZATION>. "Au Lapin Agile" is a 1905 Rose Period <PERSON>Picasso</PERSON> being billed as "the most important 20th-century picture ever to come up for auction." It may sell for more than any previous Picasso -- the record is $47.85 million set in May for "Self Portrait: <PERSON>Yo Picasso</PERSON>." 
<ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s also weighs in with the <PERSON>John T. Dorrance Jr.</PERSON> collection of impressionists at an estimated $100 million-plus (to be offered tomorrow) and a juicy assortment of paintings from other sources, more than 35 of which are expected to sell in November for at least $1 million each. 
<PERSON>Christie</PERSON>'s has snagged the 15 impressionist and modern paintings being pruned from <PERSON>Paul Mellon</PERSON>'s vast collection, including the probable $30 million-plus "Rue Mosnier, <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, Decorated With Flags on June 30, 1878" by Edouard Manet (purchased by <ORGANIZATION>Mellon</ORGANIZATION> at the <PERSON>Jacob Goldschmidt</PERSON> sale in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> in 1958 for $316,400) and a van <PERSON>Gogh</PERSON>, "Trunk of an Old Yew Tree, Arles," estimated at $25 million-plus. 
Other one-owner collections include <PERSON>Billy Wilder</PERSON>'s more modest but choice offerings, and the <PERSON>George N. Richard</PERSON> collection -- piled on top of <PERSON>Christie</PERSON>'s estimated $150 million -- $200 million of other impressionist goodies.
"A strong art market is bringing out paintings I never expected to see on the market," says <PERSON>David Nash</PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's Fine Arts Division</ORGANIZATION>.
<LOCATION>Philadelphia Museum</LOCATION> head <ORGANIZATION>Anne d'Harnoncourt</ORGANIZATION> insists that even though <PERSON>John Dorrance</PERSON> may have been the chairman of her <ORGANIZATION>Board of Trustees</ORGANIZATION>, "We weren't expecting the pictures we didn't get." 
Although <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s points out that it is "an international organization" not specifically concerned with potential losses to <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> museums, others are up in arms: "Donations have always been the main source of increased museum collections," says <PERSON>Edward H. Able Jr.</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>American Association of Museums</ORGANIZATION>. "Now there is a hemorrhaging of this country's patrimony." According to a study conducted by the <ORGANIZATION>Association of Art Museum Directors</ORGANIZATION>, the drop in the dollar value of donated works of art since 1986 is more than 50%. "This is just the tip of the iceberg, because no major collector has died recently," says <PERSON>Christopher Burge</PERSON>, president of <PERSON>Christie</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. "The next 10 years are going to be a wasteland for <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> museums." 
Major attractions have out-of-town tryouts. "Au <PERSON>Lapin Agile</PERSON>," some of the Mellon paintings, and others went around the world on a series of whistle-stop exhibition tours; <PERSON>Billy Wilder</PERSON>'s pictures went to a party at the <ORGANIZATION>Beverly Hills Hotel</ORGANIZATION>; and the Dorrance paintings hung for five days in the <LOCATION>Philadelphia Museum</LOCATION> of Art. (Even <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's PR</ORGANIZATION> department couldn't have pulled that one off; <PERSON>Dorrance</PERSON>'s executors "requested" it.) 
The weak dollar makes our market a playground for foreign bidders, and our sorry balance of trade has given them plenty of dollars to play with. "In many ways the Japanese -- particularly Japanese corporations -- dictate art price levels," says <PERSON>Susan Seidel</PERSON> of <PERSON>William Beadleston</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> private dealing concern. "They are willing to pay almost anything." 
For some, the social status that can be acquired in this way is the point of the game. "They buy the co-op, they buy the cars," says <PERSON>Ms. Seidel</PERSON>. "Then they buy `brand names' like <PERSON>Picasso</PERSON> to put on the wall." 
Big-bucks buyers trust that the market will continue its strong surge. "In October of '87 people saw that everything else went down but art went up," <PERSON>Desmond Corcoran</PERSON> of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Alex Reid & Lefevre Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> gallery points out.
In a lower key, <PERSON>Mr. Corcoran</PERSON> finds the world "full of strange speculators" and the auction estimates "incredible," and suggests the <ORGANIZATION>Dorrance</ORGANIZATION> sale as a sort of early warning system: "These pictures are not absolutely top quality," he says. "So if the market absorbs those, what comes three weeks later will do just fine." 
If all goes well, if the Picasso hits $75 million, and <ORGANIZATION>Mellon</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Dorrance</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON> and the rest get what they bargained for, the uncomfortable, questioning buzz in the art marketplace will trail off into sighs of relief, only to begin anew slightly louder than before, as the cycle starts over in the spring.
In response to your extracts from <PERSON>David Fenton</PERSON>'s memo ("How a PR Firm Executed the Alar Scare," editorial page, Oct. 3): For the past 10 years, the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION> has known about the carcinogenic hazards of <LOCATION>Alar</LOCATION>, and has carried on proceedings to remove the chemical from the market.
I was fascinated to read political publicist <PERSON>David Fenton</PERSON>'s self-serving celebration of his own work in creating the illusion that <PERSON>Alar</PERSON> was "an intolerable risk" to Americans -- particularly <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> children -- when used on apples. (The one "fact" that caught my eye -- the alleged $700,000 paid by the apple growers to <ORGANIZATION>Hill & Knowlton</ORGANIZATION> -- was overstated by more than a factor of two.) 
While I doubt the media were as gullible and malleable as <PERSON>Mr. Fenton</PERSON>'s memo suggests, the Alar scare was created, mostly out of thin air, just as <PERSON>Mr. Fenton</PERSON> claims, and the media that were taken in can learn something from this episode.
<PERSON>Mr. Fenton</PERSON> says it was not the intent of the <ORGANIZATION>NRDC</ORGANIZATION> to have school systems ban apples.
Am I also to believe that <PERSON>Meryl Streep</PERSON> did not intend to harm apple growers by condemning the use of <PERSON>Alar</PERSON>?
My family and I will continue to believe the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION> and the surgeon general and follow their nutritional guidelines to eat a balanced diet that includes many fresh fruits and vegetables. 
<LOCATION>Colts Neck</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION> 
<PERSON>Stanislav Ovcharenko</PERSON>, who represents the Soviet airline <ORGANIZATION>Aeroflot</ORGANIZATION> here, has some visions that are wild even by the current standards of perestroika. 
In his office overlooking the runway of <LOCATION>Shannon Airport</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Ovcharenko</PERSON> enthusiastically throws out what he calls "just ideas": 
First, he suggests, <ORGANIZATION>GPA Group Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, the international aircraft leasing company based in <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>, could lease some of its <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> jetliners to the Soviet airline.
Then <PERSON>Aer Lingus</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Irish</LOCATION> flag carrier, could teach <ORGANIZATION>Aeroflot</ORGANIZATION> pilots to fly the <ORGANIZATION>Boeings</ORGANIZATION>, and the fleet could be based here at <LOCATION>Shannon Airport</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Aer Rianta</PERSON>, the Irish airport authority, could build a cargo terminal in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Aeroflot</ORGANIZATION> could lease some of its cargo planes to <LOCATION>Aer Lingus</LOCATION>, through <ORGANIZATION>GPA</ORGANIZATION>, for a joint-venture cargo airline.
And then there is his notion of an Irish-Soviet charter airline to ferry Armenians to <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> via <LOCATION>Shannon</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>GPA</ORGANIZATION> is indeed talking about leasing Western planes to <ORGANIZATION>Aeroflot</ORGANIZATION> and even about buying Soviet-built Tupolev 204s.
<PERSON>Aer Rianta</PERSON> already has so many ventures with <ORGANIZATION>Aeroflot</ORGANIZATION> that its chief executive is studying Russian. 
They're very friendly." Moreover, he says, <LOCATION>Irish</LOCATION> companies are small but spunky. "We have to study their experience very well," he says. "We must find any way to get business." The two groups have been working together since the late 1970s, long before Soviet joint ventures were the rage in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>.
Aeroflot carried about 125 million passengers last year, and <LOCATION>Shannon Airport</LOCATION>, the airline's largest transit airport outside the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, saw 1,400 Aeroflot flights and 250,000 passengers pass through.
Tankers from the <LOCATION>Latvian</LOCATION> port of <LOCATION>Ventspils</LOCATION> each year unload 25 million gallons of fuel into a special tank farm at the airport.
What <ORGANIZATION>Aeroflot</ORGANIZATION> doesn't pour into its own gas-guzzling <LOCATION>Ilyushins</LOCATION> is bartered to the airport authority, which resells it to 11 Western carriers including <ORGANIZATION>Air France</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Trans World Airlines</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>International Airlines</ORGANIZATION>.
Last year, the Irish airport authority, in a joint venture with <ORGANIZATION>Aeroflot</ORGANIZATION>, opened four hard-currency duty-free shops at <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>'s Sheremetyevo Airport.
<ORGANIZATION>Aer Rianta</ORGANIZATION> now manages duty-free sales on all Aeroflot international flights out of <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>.
Duty-free shops in <LOCATION>Leningrad</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Pulkova Airport</LOCATION> opened in July, and hard-currency shops in <LOCATION>Leningrad</LOCATION> hotels and on the Soviet-Finnish frontier are coming soon. 
<PERSON>Aer Rianta</PERSON> is talking about similar joint ventures in Tashkent and in <LOCATION>Sochi</LOCATION>, a <LOCATION>Black Sea</LOCATION> resort, and even has a computer-assembly project cooking with the <LOCATION>Georgian</LOCATION> city of <LOCATION>Tbilisi</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Aeroflot</ORGANIZATION>'s international fleet of 285 planes is being repainted and refurbished at <LOCATION>Shannon Airport</LOCATION>.
Thanks to a new air-traffic agreement and the ability of <LOCATION>Irish</LOCATION> travel agents to issue <LOCATION>Aeroflot</LOCATION> tickets, tourists here are taking advantage of <ORGANIZATION>Aeroflot</ORGANIZATION>'s reasonable prices to board flights in <LOCATION>Shannon</LOCATION> for holidays in <LOCATION>Havana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kingston</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>.
A formal blessing of sorts was bestowed on this friendship in April when <PERSON>Mikhail</PERSON> and <PERSON>Raisa Gorbachev</PERSON> stopped here for talks with Irish Prime Minister <PERSON>Charles Haughey</PERSON>.
When it opened in 1939, <PERSON>Shannon</PERSON> was the first landfall in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> for thirsty airplanes flying from <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>.
Advances in aircraft fuel efficiency over the years made a <LOCATION>Shannon</LOCATION> stop unnecessary for most Western air fleets, but Aeroflot still flies inefficient Ilyushins that can't make it from <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Managua</LOCATION> on one hop. 
As a result, <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> didn't spurn the Soviets after they shot down a <ORGANIZATION>Korean Air Lines</ORGANIZATION> jetliner over the Sea of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> in 1983, though it suspended direct <ORGANIZATION>Moscow-Shannon</ORGANIZATION> flights for two months.
In fact, <PERSON>Aer Lingus</PERSON> started ferrying Russians from <LOCATION>Shannon</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> when <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> stripped Aeroflot of its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> landing rights. 
And, with those contacts in place, it could be relatively simple to add <PERSON>Aer Lingus</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>GPA</ORGANIZATION> to the team.
One variation that appealed to me at first was the "Money Smart Term Life" policy offered by <ORGANIZATION>Amex Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> unit, to the parent company's credit-card holders.
However, <ORGANIZATION>Monarch Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Springfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, has developed a "combination plan" of annuity and insurance coverage that it says does not violate the new regulations and that allows policy loans without tax consequences.
Companies "aren't comfortable playing these games, but they realize they're under pressure to make their policies look good," says <PERSON>Timothy Pfiefer</PERSON>, an actuarial consultant at <LOCATION>Tillinghast</LOCATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Towers Perrin Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the big <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> consulting firm.
At a back-yard barbecue, for example, a friend boasts that she'll only have to pay premiums on her <PERSON>John Hancock</PERSON> policy for seven years and that her death benefits will then be "guaranteed." I call her agent, <PERSON>David Dominici</PERSON>. 
Offered by insurers that include <ORGANIZATION>Security-Connecticut Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Jackson National Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>National Travelers Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while I'm still alive.
I compared one universal policy for $130,000 face amount from such an insurer, <ORGANIZATION>American Life Insurance Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neb.</LOCATION>, with a similar offering from <ORGANIZATION>Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S.</ORGANIZATION>, which operates through 11,000 commissioned salesmen.
After one year I could walk away from the <LOCATION>Ameritas</LOCATION> policy with $792, but Id get only $14 from the <ORGANIZATION>Equitable</ORGANIZATION>.
At age 65, when I'd stop paying premiums, the <LOCATION>Ameritas</LOCATION> offering would have a projected cash value $14,000 higher than the other, even though the <ORGANIZATION>Equitable</ORGANIZATION>'s policy illustration assumed a fractionally higher interest rate. 
<ORGANIZATION>USX Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and its Japanese partner, <ORGANIZATION>Kobe Steel Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, agreed to form a joint venture to build a new plant to produce hot-dipped galvanized sheet products, mainly for the automotive market. 
<ORGANIZATION>Bethlehem Steel Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>LTV Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Armco Inc.</ORGANIZATION> all have plans to build additional lines for such coated corrosion-resistant steel. 
"There's too much capacity," contended <PERSON>Charles Bradford</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ORGANIZATION>. "I don't think there's anyone not building one." He does add, however, that transplanted Japanese car makers are boosting the levels of U.S.-made steel in their autos, instead of relying heavily on imported steel.
<ORGANIZATION>USX</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Kobe Steel</PERSON> hope to reach a definitive agreement establishing the 50-50 partnership by the end of the year, with construction tentatively slated for the spring of 1990 and production by 1992. 
Analysts hailed the sweetened pension package, which they said had been the subject of rumors for several months. "This tells you <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> is serious about continuing to manage their cost structure and is committed to 20%-a-year earnings growth," said <PERSON>Jack Grubman</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
But other analysts expressed disappointment that the cost-cutting move won't result in even greater earnings growth. "This is a good move, but it only gets you to where people's expectations already are," in terms of earnings growth, said <PERSON>Joel D. Gross</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Gross</PERSON> said he had hoped that a cost savings of $450 million would result in even greater growth than the 20% annual earnings increase <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> has told analysts it expects in the future. 
<PERSON>Industriali Riunite</PERSON>, an <LOCATION>Italian</LOCATION> holding company. 
In composite trading yesterday on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at $43.375, up 87.5 cents. 
<ORGANIZATION>USACafes Limited Partnership</ORGANIZATION> said it completed the sale of its <LOCATION>Bonanza</LOCATION> restaurant franchise system to a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Metromedia Co.</ORGANIZATION> for $71 million in cash. 
USACafes, which is nearly half-owned by <PERSON>Sam</PERSON> and <PERSON>Charles Wyly</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, said it will distribute proceeds from the sale to unit holders as a liquidating dividend as soon as possible.
<ORGANIZATION>SciMed Life Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, said a federal appeals court vacated an earlier summary judgment in its favor. 
A lower court in <LOCATION>St. Paul</LOCATION> had ruled in September 1988 that a heart catheter SciMed manufactures doesn't infringe on a patent owned by <ORGANIZATION>Advanced Cardiovascular Systems</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Eli Lilly & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>SciMed</ORGANIZATION> said it "remains committed" both to the "vigorous defense" of its position that the catheter doesn't infringe the <ORGANIZATION>Lilly</ORGANIZATION> unit's patent, and to the pursuit of its own counterclaims, which allege <ORGANIZATION>Lilly</ORGANIZATION> engaged in antitrust violations and other wrongful acts. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading Friday, <ORGANIZATION>Lyondell</ORGANIZATION> was unchanged at $18.50 a share. 
While some 100 million ounces of silver once held by <PERSON>Mr. Hunt</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Middle Eastern</ORGANIZATION> associates aren't hanging over the market anymore, the price surge of 1979-80 precipitated an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver consumers to economize on silver use, <PERSON>Mr. Edgar</PERSON> says. 
Some analysts contend that silver is cheap now that prices are languishing at levels last seen in the mid-1970s. "Bargain hunters believe that silver offers the best value amongst precious metals," says <PERSON>Frederick R. Demler</PERSON>, analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
Scrap merchants are converting smaller quantities of metal into silver, while low prices are discouraging exports from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
Silver prices could also be boosted by strikes in leading producing nations <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Demler</PERSON> says. 
"There's just too much silver around," says <PERSON>Tom Butler</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Samuel Montagu & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> bullion house. 
This year alone, inventories at the <ORGANIZATION>Commodity Exchange of New York</ORGANIZATION> jumped "by a staggering 46 million to 221 million ounces" because of producer deliveries, de-stocking by fabricators and sales by disenchanted investors, says <PERSON>Rhona O'Connell</PERSON>, London-based precious metals analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton</ORGANIZATION>. 
Moreover, while <LOCATION>Asian</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Middle Eastern</ORGANIZATION> investors hoard gold and help underpin its price, silver doesn't have the same mystique, dealers say. 
Investors have gotten burned on silver so often that they are far more partial to gold, says <PERSON>Urs Seiler</PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Union Bank of Switzerland</ORGANIZATION>.
Friday's 44-cent-a-barrel price drop to $19.98 in the expiring November contract for <ORGANIZATION>West Texas Intermediate</ORGANIZATION> crude may well set the tone for trading this week in petroleum futures on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Mercantile Exchange</ORGANIZATION>.
On Friday, one analyst said, rank-and-file workers ratified a new labor agreement ending a three-month strike at the <LOCATION>Highland Valley</LOCATION> mine in <LOCATION>British Columbia</LOCATION>. 
In <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, the analyst added, employees at the <LOCATION>Cananea</LOCATION> mine, who have been out of work since late August when the mine was declared bankrupt by the government, accepted a 35% cut in the 3,800-man work force.
That brought in considerable fund selling, which continued until the close of trading. "In general, it was a bearish close," said <PERSON>Ben Hanauer</PERSON>, a copper trader at <ORGANIZATION>Rudolph Wolff & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a major commodities trading and brokerage firm.
But whether this price break has implications for this week, he said, "we will know more when the <ORGANIZATION>London Metal Exchange</ORGANIZATION> copper stock levels are released Monday morning." Another analyst said he expected <ORGANIZATION>LME</ORGANIZATION> inventories to be down by about 15,000 tons when the weekly report is issued. 
<PERSON>Bernard Savaiko</PERSON>, senior commodities analyst at <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said that when traders saw the market wasn't reacting positively to the forecasts of lower <ORGANIZATION>LME</ORGANIZATION> stocks, they perceived a bearish sign.
<PERSON>Terry L. Haines</PERSON>, formerly general manager of Canadian operations, was elected to the new position of vice president, <ORGANIZATION>North American</ORGANIZATION> sales, of this plastics concern.
Also, <PERSON>Larry A. Kushkin</PERSON>, executive vice president, <ORGANIZATION>North American</ORGANIZATION> operations, was named head of the company's international automotive operations, another new position.
He remains an executive vice president, the company said, and his new position reflects "the growing importance of the world automotive market as a market for <PERSON>A. Schulman</PERSON>'s high performance plastic materials." <ORGANIZATION>Gordon Trimmer</ORGANIZATION> will succeed <PERSON>Mr. Haines</PERSON> as manager of Canadian operations, and <PERSON>Mr. Kushkin</PERSON>'s former position isn't being filled at this time, the company said. 
Jurors in <ORGANIZATION>U.S. District Court</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> cleared <PERSON>Harold Hershhenson</PERSON>, a former executive vice president; <PERSON>John Pagones</PERSON>, a former vice president; and <PERSON>Stephen Vadas</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dean Ciporkin</PERSON>, who had been engineers with <PERSON>Cordis</PERSON>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Cordis</ORGANIZATION> sold its pacemaker operations two years ago to <ORGANIZATION>Telectronics Holding Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. 
For every dollar earned over $8,880, <ORGANIZATION>Social Security</ORGANIZATION> recipients lose 50 cents of their <ORGANIZATION>Social Security</ORGANIZATION> benefits; it's like a 50% marginal tax.

<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official reserve assets rose $6.05 billion in September, to $68.42 billion, the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury Department</ORGANIZATION> said. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> reserve assets consist of foreign currencies, gold, special drawing rights at the <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> reserve position -- its ability to draw foreign currencies -- at the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION>. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> holdings of <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> special drawing rights last month rose $247 million, to $9.49 billion, and its reserve position at the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> increased $142 million, to $8.79 billion.

The <LOCATION>Maynard</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, company is in a transition in which it is trying to reduce its reliance on mid-range machines and establish a presence in workstations and mainframes. 
"Until the new mainframe products kick in, there won't be a lot of revenue contribution at the high end, and that's hurt us," said <PERSON>Mark Steinkrauss</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION>'s director of investor relations.
<ORGANIZATION>DEC</ORGANIZATION> shares rose $1.375 to $89.75 apiece in consolidated <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> trading yesterday.
"I think the next few quarters will be difficult," said <PERSON>Steven Milunovich</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION>. "Margins will remain under pressure, and when the new mainframe does ship, I'm not sure it will be a big winner." <PERSON>Mr. Milunovich</PERSON> said he was revising his estimate for <ORGANIZATION>DEC</ORGANIZATION>'s current year from $8.20 a share to "well below $8," although he hasn't settled on a final number. 
One troubling aspect of <ORGANIZATION>DEC</ORGANIZATION>'s results, analysts said, was its performance in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
That gain probably translated into about 5% to 7% in dollar terms, well below recent quarters' gains of above 20%, reckons <PERSON>Jay Stevens</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Dean Witter Reynolds</ORGANIZATION>. "That was a disappointment" and a sign of overall computer-market softness in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Stevens</PERSON> said. 
<PERSON>Marc Schulman</PERSON>, with <ORGANIZATION>UBS Securities</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, dropped his estimate of <ORGANIZATION>DEC</ORGANIZATION>'s full-year net to $6.80 a share from $8.
Although overall revenues were stronger, <PERSON>Mr. Schulman</PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION>DEC</ORGANIZATION> "drew down its European backlog" and had flat world-wide orders overall. "The bottom line is that it's more hand to mouth than it has been before," he said. 
<PERSON>Mr. Schulman</PERSON> said he believes that the roll-out of <ORGANIZATION>DEC</ORGANIZATION>'s new mainframe will "occur somewhat more leisurely" than many of his investment colleagues expect.
At <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Nikkei</ORGANIZATION> index of 225 selected issues was up 112.16 points to 35486.38.
In early trading in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Monday, the <ORGANIZATION>Nikkei</ORGANIZATION> index rose 101.98 points to 35588.36. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Tokyo Stock Price Index</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Topix</ORGANIZATION>) of all issues listed in the <ORGANIZATION>First Section</ORGANIZATION>, which gained 22.78 points Thursday, was up 14.06 points, or 0.53%, at 2679.72. 
In turmoil caused by the previous Friday's plunge in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> stocks, the <ORGANIZATION>Nikkei</ORGANIZATION> marked a sharp 647.33-point fall Monday.
The <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> market's resiliency helped participants to regain confidence gradually as they spent more time on analyzing factors that caused the Friday plunge and realized these problems were unique to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> stocks and not directly related to <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Sapporo</ORGANIZATION> gained 80 to 1,920 and <PERSON>Kirin</PERSON> added 60 to 2,070. 
<ORGANIZATION>Kajima</ORGANIZATION> advanced 40 to 2,120 and <PERSON>Ohbayashi</PERSON> added 50 to 1,730. 
<ORGANIZATION>Fujisawa</ORGANIZATION> added 80 to 2,010 and <LOCATION>Mochida</LOCATION> advanced 230 to 4,400. 
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> was weak throughout Friday's trading, however, on what dealers attributed to generally thin interest ahead of the weekend and this week's potentially important <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> trade figures for September.
The key corporate news of the day was that <ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION> decided to withdraw from a management-led bid for <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>. 
British <ORGANIZATION>Airways</ORGANIZATION> rose initially after announcing its withdrawal from the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> deal.
The next most active top-tier stock was <ORGANIZATION>B.A.T Industries</ORGANIZATION>, the target of Sir <PERSON>James Goldsmith</PERSON>'s #13.4 billion bid.
In other active shares, <ORGANIZATION>Trusthouse Forte</ORGANIZATION> shed 10 to 294 on volume of 6.4 million shares after a <ORGANIZATION>Barclays De Zoete Wedd</ORGANIZATION> downgrading, while <PERSON>Hillsdown Holdings</PERSON>, a food products concern, was boosted 2 to 271 after it disclosed it would seek shareholder approval to begin share repurchases. 
Elsewhere in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, share prices closed higher in <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION>.
Prices were lower in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION>.
Share prices closed higher in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> and were lower in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>. 
Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION>.
That approach flopped: Last Christmas Day, a <ORGANIZATION>USAir Group Inc</ORGANIZATION>. DC-9 jetliner flew about seven passengers from <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>. 
"They're trying to keep planes flying on days they'd normally park them," says <PERSON>Roger Bard</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Mr. Mitchell Travel Service</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Burnsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION> 
<ORGANIZATION>IF CONTINENTAL Airlines</ORGANIZATION> has its way, couples like <PERSON>Marlo Thomas</PERSON> and <PERSON>Phil Donahue</PERSON> may find it a hassle to qualify for some new discounts. 
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION> unit, recently unveiled a marketing program offering free companion tickets to business-class and first-class passengers on international flights.
That irritates many women who haven't taken their husbands' last name. "What a bunch of nonsense," says <PERSON>Jessica Crosby</PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Women Business Owners</ORGANIZATION>. "This sets things way back." 
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s logic: It doesn't want business companions abusing the promotion by falsely claiming to be related. "We accommodate their choice of names by allowing them to demonstrate" family affiliation with legal documents, says <PERSON>Jim O'Donnell</PERSON>, a senior vice president. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Lambda Legal Defense</ORGANIZATION> and Education Fund of <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> has received complaints from homosexual couples whom the airline doesn't recognize as family. "It's certainly discrimination," says attorney <PERSON>Evan Wolfson</PERSON>, whose group forced <ORGANIZATION>Trans World Airlines</ORGANIZATION> this year to change a rule that allowed travelers to transfer frequent flier awards only to family members. 
WHEN HURRICANE Hugo careened through the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> coast states, it downed electric and telephone lines, shot coconuts through cottage rooftops, shattered windows and uprooted thousands of lives.
Since the hurricane, <ORGANIZATION>Midway Airlines Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>AMR Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, trimmed their one-way fares to the <LOCATION>Virgin Islands</LOCATION> to $109 from prices that were at times double that before the storm.
The fares are code-named <LOCATION>Hugo</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Compassion</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Virgin Islands Aid</LOCATION>. 
In <LOCATION>Myrtle Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, the damaged <ORGANIZATION>Yachtsman Resort</ORGANIZATION> offers daily rates as low as $35, or as much as 22% below regular prices. 
Says <PERSON>Michele Hoffman</PERSON>, a clerk in the resort's front office: "We don't have the outdoor pool, the pool table, ping pong table, snack bar or VCR, but we still have the indoor pool and <PERSON>Jacuzzi</PERSON>." 
Next month, <ORGANIZATION>Northwest Airlines</ORGANIZATION> says, a 108-year-old Lansing, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, woman is taking it up on the offer to fly with her 72-year-old son to <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>THE NATION</ORGANIZATION>'S carriers also provide discounts to <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> workers, retired military personnel and medical students.
<ORGANIZATION>WEIRTON STEEL Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it completed a $300 million sale of 10-year notes, the final step in the 1984 buy-out of the company from <ORGANIZATION>National Steel Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
The 10 7/8% notes were priced at 99.5% to yield 10.958% in an offering managed by <ORGANIZATION>Bear, Stearns & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Lazard Freres & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the company said.
<LOCATION>Weirton</LOCATION>, of <LOCATION>Weirton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>W. Va.</LOCATION>, said $60.3 million of the proceeds were used to prepay the remaining amounts on the note outstanding to <ORGANIZATION>National Intergroup Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION>National Steel</ORGANIZATION>.
WHEN JAMES <PERSON>SCHWARTZ</PERSON> was just a lad his father gave him a piece of career advice. "He told me to choose an area where just by being mediocre I could be great," recalls <PERSON>Mr. Schwartz</PERSON>, now 40.
It should be noted that <PERSON>Mr. Schwartz</PERSON>, who operates out of <LOCATION>Englewood</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, is a puckish sort who likes to give his colleagues the needle.
But reform hasn't taken hold yet. "The industry is still pretty much in its Wild West days," says <PERSON>Scott Stapf</PERSON>, director of investor education for the <ORGANIZATION>North American Securities Administrators Association</ORGANIZATION>. 
Nobody can estimate the toll, but <PERSON>John Gargan</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, planner and head of one trade group, the <ORGANIZATION>International Association of Registered Financial Planners</ORGANIZATION>, thinks the danger to investors from incompetence is "humongous," far greater than that from crookery.
For most investors "the benefits just aren't worth the risks," says <PERSON>Barbara Roper</PERSON>, who follows financial-planning issues for the <ORGANIZATION>Consumer Federation of America</ORGANIZATION>, a consumer-advocacy organization based in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. 
A lot of bad things can happen in 12 years. "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out our problem," says <PERSON>Kathryn McGrath</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>'s division of investment management. 
So the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> has proposed to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> that much of the job of oversight be turned over to an industry-funded, self-regulatory organization patterned on the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Securities Dealers</ORGANIZATION>, which operates in the brokerage business.
<PERSON>Mr. Schwartz</PERSON>, the puckish planner from <LOCATION>Englewood</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, says that allowing the business to police itself would be "like putting <PERSON>Dracula</PERSON> in charge of the blood bank." <PERSON>Mr. Gargan</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION> planner who heads one trade group, favors simply assessing the industry and giving the money to the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> to hire more staff. 
When the <ORGANIZATION>IAFP</ORGANIZATION> recently assembled other industry groups to discuss common standards that might be applied to planners, <PERSON>Mr. Gargan</PERSON>'s group was excluded.
That may be because <PERSON>Mr. Gargan</PERSON>, smarting at what he considered slurs on his membership standards made by the rival group, enrolled his dog, <PERSON>Beauregard</PERSON>, as a member of the <ORGANIZATION>IAFP</ORGANIZATION>. Then he sent the pooch's picture with the certificate of membership -- it was made out to "<LOCATION>Boris</LOCATION> `Bo' Regaard" -- to every newspaper he could think of.) 
In 1986 the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> attorney general's office got an order from a state court in <LOCATION>Albany</LOCATION> shutting down <ORGANIZATION>First Meridian Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION>Albany</LOCATION> financial-planning firm that had invested $55 million on behalf of nearly 1,000 investors.
And, the attorney general added, <ORGANIZATION>First Meridian</ORGANIZATION>'s president, <PERSON>Roger V. Sala</PERSON>, portrayed himself as a "financial expert" when his qualifications largely consisted of a high-school diploma, work as a real-estate and insurance salesman, and a stint as supervisor at a highway toll booth.
<ORGANIZATION>Harry Manion</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Sala</PERSON>'s attorney, says his client denies any wrongdoing and adds that the attorney general's contentions about <ORGANIZATION>First Meridian</ORGANIZATION>'s business practices are incorrect.
As for <PERSON>Mr. Sala</PERSON>'s qualifications, "the snooty attorneys for the state of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> decided <PERSON>Mr. Sala</PERSON> wasn't qualified because he didn't have a <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> degree," says <PERSON>Mr. Manion</PERSON>. 
Two such actions, both filed earlier this year in <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> state court in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, could be particularly embarrassing to the industry: both name <PERSON>J. Chandler Peterson</PERSON>, an <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> financial planner who is a founder and past chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>IAFP</ORGANIZATION>, as defendant. 
The other suit was filed by two men in a dispute over $100,000 investments each says he made with <PERSON>Mr. Peterson</PERSON> as part of an effort to purchase the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Scottsdale</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Scottsdale</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz</LOCATION>.
One plaintiff, a doctor, testified in an affidavit that he also gave <PERSON>Mr. Peterson</PERSON> $50,000 to join a sort of investment club which essentially gave the physician "the privilege of making additional investments" with <PERSON>Mr. Peterson</PERSON>. 
Wearing a business suit and western-style hat and boots, he opened up his briefcase and dumped $1 million in cash on a table in front of the directors, says <PERSON>Myron Diebel</PERSON>, the bank's president. "He said he wanted to show the color of his money," recalls <PERSON>Mr. Diebel</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Emshwiller</PERSON> is a staff reporter in <ORGANIZATION>The Wall Street Journal</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> bureau. 
<ORGANIZATION>East Rock Partners Limited Partnership</ORGANIZATION> said it proposed to acquire <ORGANIZATION>A.P. Green Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> for $40 a share. 
In an Oct. 19 letter to <ORGANIZATION>A.P. Green</ORGANIZATION>'s board, <ORGANIZATION>East Rock</ORGANIZATION> said the offer is subject to the signing of a merger agreement by no later than Oct. 31. 
The company is a <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>, maker of refractory products. 
<LOCATION>East Rock</LOCATION> also said in the filing that it boosted its stake in <ORGANIZATION>A.P. Green</ORGANIZATION> to 8.7%.
New York-based <PERSON>John Kuhns</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert MacDonald</PERSON> control <ORGANIZATION>East Rock Partners Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the sole general partner of <ORGANIZATION>East Rock Partners L.P.</ORGANIZATION>
The sole limited partner of the partnership is <ORGANIZATION>Westwood Brick Lime Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, an indirect subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Westwood Group Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
Both <LOCATION>Westwood Brick</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Westwood Group</ORGANIZATION> are based in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Rorer Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> will report that third-quarter profit rose more than 15% from a year earlier, though the gain is wholly due to asset sales, <PERSON>Robert Cawthorn</PERSON>, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said. 
<PERSON>Asilone</PERSON>, an antacid, was sold to <ORGANIZATION>Boots PLC</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
Thrombinar, a drug used to stanch bleeding, was sold to <ORGANIZATION>Jones Medical Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Cawthorn</PERSON> attributed the decline in third-quarter operating profit to the stronger dollar, which reduces the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars; to accelerated buying of Rorer products in the second quarter because of a then-pending July 1 price increase, and to higher marketing expenses for <PERSON>Rorer</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Maalox</ORGANIZATION> antacid, whose sales and market share in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> had slipped in the first half of 1989.
He said <PERSON>Rorer</PERSON> opted to sell <ORGANIZATION>Asilone</ORGANIZATION> and Thrombinar to raise revenue that would "kick start" its increased marketing efforts behind <ORGANIZATION>Maalox</ORGANIZATION>, still its top-selling product with about $215 million in world-wide sales in 1988. "We had underfunded <PERSON>Maalox</PERSON> for a year," he said, because the company was concentrating on research and development and promoting other drugs. 
He said <PERSON>Rorer</PERSON> will spend $15 million to $20 million more on <ORGANIZATION>Maalox</ORGANIZATION> advertising and promotion in the second half of 1989 than in the year-earlier period.
<ORGANIZATION>MGM Grand Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it filed a registration statement with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> for a public offering of six million common shares. 
<ORGANIZATION>Vickers PLC</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> defense and engineering company, said an investment unit controlled by <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> financier <PERSON>Ron Brierley</PERSON> raised its stake in the company Friday to 15.02% from about 14.6% Thursday and from 13.7% the previous week. 
<ORGANIZATION>I.E.P. Securities Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <PERSON>Mr. Brierley</PERSON>'s Hong Kong-based Industrial Equity (<LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>) <LOCATION>Ltd.</LOCATION>, boosted its holdings in Vickers to 38.8 million shares. 
"<PERSON>Ron Brierley</PERSON> clearly views our company as a good investment," a <ORGANIZATION>Vickers</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said.
Vickers makes tanks for the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> army, <ORGANIZATION>Rolls Royce</ORGANIZATION> cars, and has marine and medical businesses. 
The disorders, which 20 years ago struck middle-age and older people, "now strike people at the height of productivity," says <PERSON>Robert M.A. Hirschfeld</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>National Institute of Mental Health</ORGANIZATION>, who spoke at the presentation of the study's findings. 
"We all like stress, but there's a limit," says <PERSON>Paul D'Arcy</PERSON>, of <PERSON>Rohrer</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Hibler & Replogle</ORGANIZATION>, a corporate psychology and management consulting firm.
<PERSON>Mr. Schantz</PERSON> was vice president and chief operating officer of the <ORGANIZATION>Acrylic</ORGANIZATION> division of <ORGANIZATION>Polycast Technology Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Separately, the board expanded to six members with the election of <PERSON>David L. Holewinski</PERSON>, a consultant.
<ORGANIZATION>Colgate Palmolive Co.</ORGANIZATION> reported third-quarter net income rose 27%, bolstered by strong sales in its Latin American business and surprisingly healthy profits from <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> operations. 
<PERSON>Reuben Mark</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Colgate</ORGANIZATION>, said earnings growth was fueled by strong sales in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
Results were also bolstered by "a very meaningful increase in operating profit at <ORGANIZATION>Colgate</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> business," he said. 
Operating profit at <ORGANIZATION>Colgate</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> household products and personal care businesses, which include such well-known brands as Colgate toothpaste and <PERSON>Fab</PERSON> laundry detergent, jumped more than 40%, the company said.
"We've done a lot to improve (<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>) results and a lot more will be done," <PERSON>Mr. Mark</PERSON> said. "Improving profitability of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> operations is an extremely high priority in the company." 
Separately, <ORGANIZATION>Colgate</ORGANIZATION> Wednesday finalized an agreement with <ORGANIZATION>MacroChem Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a tiny dental products and pharmaceutical concern based in <LOCATION>Billerica</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, to market in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> four of <ORGANIZATION>MacroChem</ORGANIZATION>'s FDA-approved dental products.
<ORGANIZATION>Whittle Communications Limited Partnership</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Knoxville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, will launch its first media property targeting Hispanic women. 
The television element of "La Familia" includes a series of two-minute informational features to air seven days a week on the Spanish-language <ORGANIZATION>Univision</ORGANIZATION> network, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Univision Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which is 80%-owned by <ORGANIZATION>Hallmark Cards Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
"When elephants start fighting, ants get killed," says <PERSON>Murray Riese</PERSON>, co-owner of <ORGANIZATION>National Restaurants</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> franchisee for <LOCATION>Pizza</LOCATION> Hut, <PERSON>Roy Rogers</PERSON> and other chains. 
The chains "used to offer discounts during winter when business was slow, but in the last year or so, discounting has become a 12-month thing," says <PERSON>Donald Harty</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Charisma Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> franchisee of <ORGANIZATION>Grand Metropolitan PLC</ORGANIZATION>'s Burger King chain.
And <PERSON>Bill Konopnicki</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Safford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, licensee of <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's Corp.</ORGANIZATION> who is chairman of the company's <ORGANIZATION>National Operators Advisory Board</ORGANIZATION>, says some fast-food outlets "could be in serious trouble, based on the amount of discounting that seems to be going on." 
But early this year, <ORGANIZATION>PepsiCo Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Taco Bell</ORGANIZATION> unit and <ORGANIZATION>Wendy's International Inc.</ORGANIZATION> slashed prices and stepped up promotions, says <PERSON>John Rohs</PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Wertheim Schroder & Co</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Joe Mack</PERSON>, a district manager for <ORGANIZATION>Cormack Enterprises Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a Burger King operator in <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neb.</LOCATION>, says discounting is so prevalent that "we have to serve 15% to 20% more customers" to keep sales level. "It's almost as if you're doing extra work to give away the food," he says. 
<PERSON>Alan D'Agosto</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Panda's Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, an operator of <ORGANIZATION>Arby</ORGANIZATION>'s restaurants in <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION>, says: "All we're doing is keeping the customers coming, but we aren't increasing sales." With fast-food outlets on every corner, he, like many, doesn't think he has a choice in the price war: "Our customers say that they won't go into a fast-food store unless they get a coupon." 
If the battle continues much longer, many fast-food businesses will close or merge, predicts <PERSON>Vincent Morrissey</PERSON>, who owns a string of <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> Fried Chicken stores in the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>. "The industry is overbuilt," he says. "Fast-food franchisers have managed to squeeze in stores into every corner available." 
The <ORGANIZATION>National Restaurant Association</ORGANIZATION> says quick-service restaurant units in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> rose 14% to 131,146 between 1983 and 1987, the last year for which figures are available.
With the market so crowded, says a spokesman for <PERSON>Wendy</PERSON>'s in <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, "If you're doing well, you're doing well at someone else's expense." 
According to <PERSON>Mr. Rohs</PERSON>, inflation-adjusted, same-store sales at company-owned <ORGANIZATION>Wendy</ORGANIZATION>'s units in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> have trailed year-earlier levels throughout 1989, except for August. "McDonald's has also been running negative all year," the analyst says. 
Spokesmen for <PERSON>Wendy</PERSON>'s and McDonald's criticized <PERSON>Mr. Rohs</PERSON>'s calculations.
<PERSON>Jack Greenberg</PERSON>, executive vice president and chief financial officer of <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's</ORGANIZATION>, says the company doesn't compute, much less disclose, inflation-adjusted, same-store sales.
Profit margins at company-owned McDonald's outlets in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> "are holding up quite nicely," says <PERSON>Mr. Greenberg</PERSON>.
Big franchise groups "can ride out the storm a lot longer," says <PERSON>Mr. Harty</PERSON>, the Burger King operator in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Morrissey</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> Fried Chicken franchisee, notes that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties, or portion of sales, that they must pay franchisers. 
But once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program, the franchiser can demand full participation to the very end, says <PERSON>Lew Rudnick</PERSON>, a principal of <ORGANIZATION>Rudnick & Wolfe</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> law firm with franchise industry clients.
<ORGANIZATION>Basf AG</ORGANIZATION> said it moved its headquarters for <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and the headquarters for the <ORGANIZATION>Asia/Australia</ORGANIZATION> regional division to <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>, effective Oct. 
The central offices for both regions were previously located in <LOCATION>Ludwigshafen</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Basf</LOCATION> headquarters. 
In <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>, where humor has long been the only way to express political criticism, they're not laughing about their new leader <PERSON>Egon Krenz</PERSON>.
"You have to have clear feelings about someone before you can make jokes," says an East German mother of two who loves swapping political barbs with her friends. "With <PERSON>Krenz</PERSON>, we just don't know what to expect." <PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON> doesn't seem to be the knee-jerk hardliner many initially thought he was when the 52-year-old <PERSON>Politburo</PERSON> member was selected last week to succeed <PERSON>Erich Honecker</PERSON>.
According to <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>ADN</ORGANIZATION> news agency, <PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON> spoke to Soviet leader <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON> by telephone over the weekend and acknowledged <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> could learn from <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>'s glasnost policies.
Already last week, <PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON> started overhauling <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>'s heavily censored and notoriously boring news media.
<PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON> is not only closely identified with his mentor, <PERSON>Mr. Honecker</PERSON>, but also blamed for ordering violent police action against protesters this month and for praising <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> for sending tanks against student demonstrators. "I hope he grows with the job," says <PERSON>Rainer Eppelmann</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Protestant</ORGANIZATION> pastor in <LOCATION>East Berlin</LOCATION>. "The most important thing is that he have a chance." 
Although <PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON> is dedicated to <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>'s conservative vein of communism, there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades.
Unlike <PERSON>Mr. Honecker</PERSON>, who tended to lecture people about socialist values, <PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON> enjoys asking questions. 
Indeed, one of his first actions as leader was to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> and wander among the workers -- a la <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>.
Rather than trying to "lecture us," says one congressional aide who attended the two-hour meeting, <PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON> "wanted to listen." Rep. <PERSON>Ronnie Flippo</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>), one of the members of the delegation, says he was particularly impressed by <PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON>'s ready admission that <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> needed to change. 
<PERSON>Barbara Donovan</PERSON>, an expert on <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Radio Free Europe</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Munich</LOCATION>, says <PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON> may project a smooth image, but she doubts he's a true reformer.
Even if he is, she adds, he appears to have only limited room for maneuver within the <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION>Politburo</ORGANIZATION>. 
The sudden growth of the opposition movement, together with the steady outflow of citizens escaping through <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>, has plunged the country into its deepest political crisis since an anti-Soviet workers' uprising in 1953. 
"He doesn't have any honeymoon period," says a <LOCATION>Western</LOCATION> diplomat based in <LOCATION>East Berlin</LOCATION>. "But if he's sharp and quick, he has a chance." The diplomat adds that <PERSON>Mr. Krenz</PERSON> has several things going for him.
<ORGANIZATION>Manhattan National Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Michael A. Conway</PERSON>, president and chief executive officer, was elected chief executive of the holding company's two principal insurance subsidiaries. 
<PERSON>Mr. Conway</PERSON>, 42 years old, was elected chairman, president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Manhattan Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> and president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Manhattan National Life Insurance Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Harry Rossi</PERSON>, 69, chairman of the holding company, also remains chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Manhattan National Life Insurance Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Conway</PERSON> was executive vice president and chief investment officer of <ORGANIZATION>Union Central Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION>, in 1987, when <ORGANIZATION>Union Central</ORGANIZATION> bought a 54% interest in <ORGANIZATION>Manhattan National Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
He resigned as an officer of <ORGANIZATION>Central Life</ORGANIZATION> to accept the <ORGANIZATION>Manhattan National</ORGANIZATION> presidency. 
<ORGANIZATION>Supplemental Security Income</ORGANIZATION> payments to the disabled also will rise 4.7%, starting with checks received on Dec. 29, 1988, increasing the maximum <ORGANIZATION>SSI</ORGANIZATION> payment to $386 from $368 a month. 
A <ORGANIZATION>Labor Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the unusually high number of initial claims for state unemployment benefits reflects the impact of Hurricane Hugo on southern states, particularly <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>.
The euphoria was such that investors responded to good earnings reports of companies such as <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>, while ignoring the disappointing profits of companies such as <ORGANIZATION>Caterpillar</ORGANIZATION>, analysts said. 
Among other stocks involved in restructurings or rumored to be so: <ORGANIZATION>Holiday Corp.</ORGANIZATION> gained 1 7/8 to 73 and <ORGANIZATION>Honeywell</ORGANIZATION> rose 2 7/8 to 81 1/2. 
One floor trader noted in astonishment that nobody seemed to mind the news that <ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION> isn't making a special effort to revive the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> buy-out.
Takeover enthusiasm may have been renewed when an investor group disclosed yesterday that it had obtained all the financing required to complete its $1.6 billion leveraged buy-out of <ORGANIZATION>American Medical International</ORGANIZATION>. "That's put some oomph back into this market," said <PERSON>Peter VandenBerg</PERSON>, a vice president of equity trading at <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton</ORGANIZATION>. 
But some traders thought there was less to the rally than met the eye. "There is no strength behind this rally," asserted <PERSON>Chung Lew</PERSON>, head trader at <ORGANIZATION>Kleinwort Benson North America</ORGANIZATION>. "It's traders squaring positions.
By Wednesday, the outstanding October contracts amounted to 8,524, representing about $1.13 billion in stock, noted <PERSON>Donald Selkin</PERSON>, head of stock-index futures research at <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities</ORGANIZATION>, who expects a volatile expiration today. "There has been a tremendous increase" in <ORGANIZATION>MMI</ORGANIZATION> positions, <PERSON>Mr. Selkin</PERSON> said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris</ORGANIZATION> added 1 1/8 to 44 1/2 in <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> composite trading of 3.7 million shares, <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola Co.</ORGANIZATION> gained 2 3/8 to 70 3/8, <ORGANIZATION>Merck</ORGANIZATION> gained 1 3/8 to 77 3/8 and <ORGANIZATION>American Telephone & Telegraph</ORGANIZATION> advanced 7/8 to 43 3/8 on 2.5 million shares. 
<ORGANIZATION>IMA Acquisition</ORGANIZATION>, an investor group that includes <ORGANIZATION>First Boston</ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON>Pritzker</PERSON> family of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>Chemical Bank</ORGANIZATION> had made arrangements for 23 other banks to provide $509 million in bank financing for the buy-out offer.
Elsewhere on the takeover front, <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner</ORGANIZATION> advanced 2 5/8 to 136 5/8 and <ORGANIZATION>Warner Communications</ORGANIZATION> tacked on 7/8 to 63 7/8.
The <ORGANIZATION>Delaware Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> affirmed a ruling that barred <ORGANIZATION>Chris-Craft Industries</ORGANIZATION> from voting its <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> preferred stock as a separate class in deciding on the companies' proposed merger. 
<ORGANIZATION>Paramount Communications</ORGANIZATION> climbed 1 1/4 to 58 1/2 and <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> rose 1 1/2 to 64; both media companies have long been mentioned as potential acquisition candidates.

In a filing with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Terra</PERSON> said he sold 263,684 <ORGANIZATION>First Illinois</ORGANIZATION> common shares from Aug. 9 to Aug. 28 for $9.9375 to $10.5625 a share.
<PERSON>Mr. Terra</PERSON> said in the filing that he sold the stock to decrease his position in the <LOCATION>Evanston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, banking concern.
When <PERSON>Rune Andersson</PERSON> set out to revive flagging Swedish conglomerate <ORGANIZATION>Trelleborg AB</ORGANIZATION> in the early 1980s, he spurned the advice of trendy management consultants. 
<PERSON>Mr. Andersson</PERSON> is anxious to strengthen <ORGANIZATION>Trelleborg</ORGANIZATION>'s balance sheet.
On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION>Trelleborg</ORGANIZATION>'s directors announced plans to spin off two big divisions -- minerals processing, and building and distribution -- as separately quoted companies on <ORGANIZATION>Stockholm's Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Trelleborg</ORGANIZATION>'s internationally traded "Bfree" series stock plunged SKr29 ($4.48) to SKr205 ($31.65) in volatile trading Monday in <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Andersson</PERSON> says he is confident that taking parts of the company public will help erase the "conglomerate stigma" that has held down <ORGANIZATION>Trelleborg</ORGANIZATION>'s share price.
A family foundation set up by late founder <PERSON>Henry Dunker</PERSON> controls 59% of <ORGANIZATION>Trelleborg</ORGANIZATION>'s voting shares outstanding.
Applying prowess gained during earlier stints at appliance maker <ORGANIZATION>AB Electrolux</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Andersson</PERSON> and a handful of loyal lieutenants aggressively stripped away dead wood -- and got quick results. 
The treatment turned <ORGANIZATION>Trelleborg</ORGANIZATION> into one of <LOCATION>Scandinavia</LOCATION>'s biggest and fastest-growing industrial concerns.
Many analysts expect <PERSON>Mr. Andersson</PERSON>, who owns 1.7% of the company, to be named <ORGANIZATION>Trelleborg</ORGANIZATION>'s new chairman when <PERSON>Ernst Herslow</PERSON> steps down next year.
Last month, in his boldest move yet, <PERSON>Mr. Andersson</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Trelleborg</ORGANIZATION> joined forces with <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Noranda Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in a joint $2 billion hostile takeover of another big Canadian mining concern, <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. Industry analysts suggest that the conquest of Falconbridge could vault <ORGANIZATION>Trelleborg</ORGANIZATION> from a regional Scandinavian success story to a world-class mining concern. 
"Trelleborg isn't in the same league yet as mining giants such as <ORGANIZATION>RTZ Corp.</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>Anglo-American Corp.</ORGANIZATION>," says <PERSON>Mike Kurtanjek</PERSON>, a mining analyst at <ORGANIZATION>James Capel & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. "But we certainly like what we've seen so far." 
Analysts say its chances of success will likely hinge on how well <ORGANIZATION>Trelleborg</ORGANIZATION> manages to cooperate with <LOCATION>Noranda</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>Falconbridge</LOCATION> venture. 
<ORGANIZATION>Noranda</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Trelleborg</ORGANIZATION> each came close to winning Falconbridge alone before the successful joint bid.
Some analysts say <ORGANIZATION>Noranda</ORGANIZATION> would prefer to break up <LOCATION>Falconbridge</LOCATION>, and that the <LOCATION>Swedes</LOCATION> -- relatively inexperienced in international mining operations -- could have problems holding their own with a much bigger partner like <ORGANIZATION>Noranda</ORGANIZATION> operating on its home turf. 
<PERSON>Mr. Andersson</PERSON> insists that <ORGANIZATION>Trelleborg</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Noranda</ORGANIZATION> haven't discussed a Falconbridge break-up.
<ORGANIZATION>Avondale Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>, received a $23 million contract from the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> to enlarge by 50% the capacity of an auxiliary oiler.

<ORGANIZATION>Lotus Development Corp.</ORGANIZATION> is in talks to sell its Signal stock-quote service to <ORGANIZATION>Infotechnology Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> parent of Financial News Network, people familiar with the negotiations said.
<LOCATION>Lotus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, has been rumored to have the sale of the four-year-old unit under consideration for a year.
A labor-management group is preparing a revised buy-out bid for <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION> that would transfer majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands, according to people familiar with the group. 
In composite trading Friday on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> closed at $168.50 a share, down $21.625. 
The failed takeover would have given <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> employees 75% voting control of the nation's second-largest airline, with management getting 10% control and <ORGANIZATION>British Air</ORGANIZATION> 15%.
Although the pilots are expected to continue to pursue the bid, <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Stephen Wolf</PERSON> may be asked to withdraw from the buy-out effort, at least temporarily, and to return to running the company full time. 
However, the only outsider who has emerged to lead such a shareholder vote, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON>, who triggered the buy-out with a $5.4 billion bid in early August, is hanging back -- apparently to avoid being blamed for contributing to the deal's collapse. 
Three top advisers to <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON> visited <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> late last week, at least in part to confer with executives at <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON> had paid $6 million for <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>'s backing of his last bid.
On Friday, <ORGANIZATION>British Air</ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying it "does not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> in the foreseeable future." However, several people said that <ORGANIZATION>British Air</ORGANIZATION> might yet rejoin the bidding group and that the carrier made the statement to answer questions from <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> regulators about how it plans to use proceeds of a securities offering previously earmarked for the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> buy-out. 
Speculation has also arisen that the <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> executive most closely identified with the failure to gain bank financing, chief financial officer <PERSON>John Pope</PERSON>, may come under pressure to resign.
Despite the buy-out group's failure to obtain financing, <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> remains obligated to pay $26.7 million in investment banking and legal fees to the group's advisers, <ORGANIZATION>Lazard Freres & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison</ORGANIZATION>. 
Alusuisse of America Inc.</ORGANIZATION> plans to sell its <ORGANIZATION>Consolidated Aluminum Corp.</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary as part of its strategy to focus more on aluminum packaging in the <LOCATION>U.S. 
<ORGANIZATION>Alusuisse</ORGANIZATION> is a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Swiss Aluminium Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>, producer of aluminum, chemicals and packaging products.

<ORGANIZATION>The Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION>American Home Products Corp.</ORGANIZATION> agreed to recall certain generic drugs that were produced by its Quantum Pharmics unit in <LOCATION>Amityville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION> 
The <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> requested the recall of Quantum's mioxidil tablets, chlorazepate dipotassium tablets and meclofenamate sodium capsules because, it said, the size of the production runs submitted for testing to gain <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> approval was in each case misrepresented as much larger than it actually was. 
<ORGANIZATION>American Home Products</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, agreed to recall four other products, trazadone, doxepin, diazepam and lorazapam, because of concerns about data submitted in their original approval applications before the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION>. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>American Home Products</ORGANIZATION> rose 75 cents to $105 on Friday.

Dealers say the budding trade in <PERSON>Mr. Jackson</PERSON>'s canceled checks is unusual. "I don't know of any living ballplayer that's ever done it," says <PERSON>Jack Smalling</PERSON>, a dealer in Ames, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, and a recognized expert in the field of baseball autographs. 
An initial batch of <PERSON>Mr. Jackson</PERSON>'s checks was on sale at a baseball-card show held in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> over Labor Day weekend.
"For someone who has everything else -- <PERSON>Reggie</PERSON>'s jersey, cap and cards -- his checks might be a nice addition," says <PERSON>William Vizas</PERSON>, owner of <PERSON>Bill</PERSON>'s Sports Collectibles in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, who examined the checks at the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> card show. 
But these players were dead. "Maybe three years ago, there were a lot of {Ty} Cobbs in the hobby, and awhile back there were <PERSON>Babe Ruth</PERSON> checks," says <PERSON>Mr. Smalling</PERSON>. 
However, the thought of a living player selling his checks rubs some people the wrong way. "Maybe I'm a little stuffy, but I wouldn't sell them," sniffs <PERSON>Bob Machon</PERSON>, owner of <LOCATION>Papa</LOCATION>'s Sports Cards in <LOCATION>Menlo Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION> "Who knows how much they'll be worth 100 years from now?" 
"I would say he's definitely not in need of money," says <PERSON>Matt Merola</PERSON>, an agent of <PERSON>Mr. Jackson</PERSON>'s based in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. "He has good investments." 
<LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> passed the power-sharing accord to end the country's 14-year-old conflict, but the Christian military leader wad the plan was "full of ambiguities." The Arab League-sponsored pact, drafted during three weeks of talks at the <LOCATION>Saudi Arabian</LOCATION> resort of <LOCATION>Taif</LOCATION>, includes <LOCATION>Syrian</LOCATION> proposals for at least a partial troop pullout from <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>, and guarantees an equal number of seats for Moslems and Christians in the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>. 
The rejection by <PERSON>Aoun</PERSON>, who has demanded a total and immediate pull-out of <LOCATION>Damascus</LOCATION>'s 33,000 troops, puts the future of the agreement in doubt.

The existence of the policy became known after <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> disclosed it to seven <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> senators last week, citing the plan as an example of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of covert actions, officials said. 
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> conceded that the requirement didn't affect a decision to lend only minor support to this month's failed effort to oust <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, aides said.

"Inflation could be a real surprise," said <PERSON>Samuel D.

<PERSON>Gary Ciminero</PERSON>, economist at <ORGANIZATION>Fleet/Norstar Financial Group</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Providence</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>R.I.</LOCATION>, expects the deflator to rise 3.7%, well below the second quarter's 4.6%, partly because of what he believes will be temporarily better price behavior.

New experiments at some of the big national laboratories are still unable to find hints of nuclear fusion reactions, leaving only the finding of tritium in a <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> experiment to support <ORGANIZATION>University of Utah</ORGANIZATION> chemists' claim of achieving hydrogen fusion at room temperatures. 
Neither of the two chemists whose <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> experiments triggered the cold fusion uproar, <PERSON>Martin Fleischmann</PERSON> and <PERSON>B. Stanley Pons</PERSON>, were at the meeting.
<PERSON>Fleischmann</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pons</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Fleischmann</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pons</PERSON> said their experiments also produced large amounts of heat.
One of the seven reports presented here of excess heat production was given by <PERSON>Richard A. Oriani</PERSON>, professor of chemical engineering at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Minnesota</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Oriani</PERSON> said his skepticism of the <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> claims was initially confirmed when his first experiments last spring failed to produce results.
A cell filled with heavy water is producing 1.0 to 1.5 watts more heat than an identical electrolytic cell filled with ordinary water next to it, reported <PERSON>Turgut M. Gur</PERSON>, an associate of materials scientist <PERSON>Robert A. Huggins</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> experimental team. 
One of the few hints the excess heat might be produced by fusion came from brief remarks by chemist <PERSON>John Bockris</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Texas A&M University</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Fleischmann</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Pons</ORGANIZATION> initially reported indirect evidence of neutrons being produced in their experiment but later conceded the measurements were questionable.
Researchers at <ORGANIZATION>Sandia National Laboratories</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Albuquerque</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.M.</LOCATION>, reported they went so far as to take a "cold fusion" experiment and three neutron detectors into a tunnel under 300 feet of granite to shield the detectors from cosmic rays.
<PERSON>Shimson Gottesfeld</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Los Alamos National Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> said researchers there detected a burst of neutrons from an early cold fusion experiment last April but decided not to announce it until they could confirm it.
At the <ORGANIZATION>Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, new experiments indicated that the lithium added to the heavy water so it will conduct a current can produce previously unsuspected electrical effects on the surface of the palladium rod -- which Messrs.
<PERSON>Fleischmann</PERSON> and Pons might have misinterpreted, reported <PERSON>Philip Ross</PERSON> from the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> laboratory.

<PERSON>Mr. Ewing</PERSON> is a consultant based in <LOCATION>Winchester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, and author of "Justice on the Job: Resolving Grievances in the Nonunion Workplace" (<ORGANIZATION>Harvard Business School Press</ORGANIZATION>, 1989). 
The notification policy was part of a set of guidelines on handling coups outlined in a secret 1988 exchange of letters between the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration and the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Intelligence Committee</ORGANIZATION>. 
The existence of the guidelines has become known since President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> disclosed them privately to seven <ORGANIZATION>Republican</ORGANIZATION> senators at a White House meeting last Monday.
Officials familiar with the meeting said <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> cited the policy as an example of the sort of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of such covert actions as this month's futile effort to oust Panamanian dictator <PERSON>Manuel Noriega</PERSON>. 
According to the officials, <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> even read to the senators selections from a highly classified letter from the committee to the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> discussing the guidelines.
No notification was ever considered, officials said, apparently because the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> didn't think the coup plotters intended to kill <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON>, but merely sought to imprison him. 
However, the disclosure of the guidelines, first reported last night by <ORGANIZATION>NBC News</ORGANIZATION>, is already being interpreted on <LOCATION>Capitol Hill</LOCATION> as an unfair effort to pressure <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
It has reopened the bitter wrangling between the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> over who is responsible for the failure to oust <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> and, more broadly, for difficulties in carrying out covert activities abroad. 
A statement issued by the office of the committee chairman, <PERSON>Sen. David Boren</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Okla.</LOCATION>), charged that the disclosure is part of a continuing effort to shift the criticism for the failure of the recent coup attempt in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
Republican <PERSON>Sen. William Cohen</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, the panel's vice chairman, said of the disclosure that "a text torn out of context is a pretext, and it is unfair for those in the White House who are leaking to present the evidence in a selective fashion." 
The guideline wasn't a law, but a joint interpretation of how the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> might operate during foreign coups in light of the longstanding presidential order banning a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> role in assassinations.
Although the notification guideline wasn't carried out in this month's coup attempt, some administration officials argue that it may have led to hesitation and uncertainty on the part of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> intelligence and military operatives in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
The issue came to a head last year, officials recalled, partly because the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration had sought unsuccessfully to win committee approval of funding for new <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> coup efforts.
Though the assassination ban is a <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> order that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> never voted on, the intelligence committees can exercise influence over its interpretation.
Last week, <ORGANIZATION>Central Intelligence Agency</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>William Webster</PERSON> publicly called on <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to provide new interpretations of the assassination order that would permit the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> more freedom to act in coups. 
The administration has reacted to criticism that it mishandled the latest coup attempt by seeking to blame <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> for restrictions the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> said have hampered its freedom of action.
However, last week <PERSON>Mr. Webster</PERSON>'s two top <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> deputies said congressional curbs hadn't hampered the spy agency's role in the coup attempt in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.

"The overnight success story is part of our culture, and our society puts an emphasis on it with lotteries and <PERSON>Ed McMahon</PERSON> making millionaires out of people," says <PERSON>Michael Cunningham</PERSON>, an associate professor of psychology at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Kentucky</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>. "Other people are making it overnight, and the rest who toil daily don't want to miss that opportunity when it seems to come along." 
Adds <PERSON>Spencer Barasch</PERSON>, branch chief for enforcement at the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Fort Worth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>: "Why do people play the lottery when the odds are great against them?
The owner of the company, <PERSON>Stephen Smith</PERSON>, who has since pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges, confided to investors that he had a secret agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Amoco Oil Co.</ORGANIZATION> and said the location of his wells was confidential, according to a civil suit filed in a <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> state court by the <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> comptroller's office.
Such schemes, says <PERSON>Tony Adamski</PERSON>, chief of the financial-crimes unit of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Bureau of Investigation</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, appeal to investors' "desire to believe this is really true and that they are part of a chosen group being given this opportunity." 
For some investors, it's the appearances that leave them deceived. "The trappings of success go a long way -- wearing the right clothes, doing the right things," says <PERSON>Paul Andreassen</PERSON>, an associate professor of psychology at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Paul Wenz</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, attorney, says a promise of unrealistic returns would have made him leery.

<PERSON>William Lynes</PERSON>, a retired engineer from <ORGANIZATION>Lockheed Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, says he and his wife, Lily, warmed to the investment pitches of a penny-stock peddler from <ORGANIZATION>Stuart-James Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> after the broker told them he, too, had once worked with <ORGANIZATION>Lockheed</ORGANIZATION>. 
The Lyneses, of <ORGANIZATION>Powder Springs</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, have filed suit in <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> state court against <PERSON>Stuart James</PERSON>, alleging fraud.
"It's not uncommon for these guys to send pictures of themselves or their families to ingratiate themselves to their clients," says <PERSON>Terree Bowers</PERSON>, chief of the major-frauds section of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. "We've seen cases where salesmen will affect the accent of the region of the country they are calling.
People may be particularly vulnerable to flim-flam pitches when they are in the midst of a major upheaval in their lives. "Sometimes when people are making big changes, retiring from their jobs, moving to a new area, they lose their bearings," says <PERSON>Maury Elvekrog</PERSON>, a licensed psychologist who is now an investment adviser and principal in <ORGANIZATION>Seger-Elvekrog Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, investment-counseling firm. "They may be susceptible to some song and dance if it hits them at the right time." 
Almost all of us in comparable circumstances might be victimized in some way," says <PERSON>Jerald Jellison</PERSON>, a psychology professor at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Southern California</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Cortese</PERSON>, a 33-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Delta Air Lines</ORGANIZATION> engineer, invested some $2,000 in penny stocks through a broker who promised quick returns. "We were saving up to buy a house, and my wife was pregnant," says <PERSON>Mr. Cortese</PERSON>. "It was just before the Christmas holidays, and I figured we could use some extra cash." The investment is worth about $130 today. 
<PERSON>Ms. Brannigan</PERSON> is a staff reporter in <ORGANIZATION>The Wall Street Journal</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> bureau. 
<ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> said it signed a contract with the developers of the <ORGANIZATION>Ocean State Power</ORGANIZATION> project for the second phase of an independent $400 million power plant, which is being built in <LOCATION>Burrillville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>R.I.</LOCATION> 
GE, along with a division of <ORGANIZATION>Ebasco</ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Enserch Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, have been building the first 250-megawatt phase of the project, which they expect to complete in late 1990.
The new directors are <PERSON>Gordon M. Sprenger</PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>LifeSpan Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Peter S. Willmott</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Willmott Services Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
At the ritzy <ORGANIZATION>Fashion Island Shopping Center</ORGANIZATION>, the tanned and elegant ladies of this wealthy <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> beach community disembark from their Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs for another day of exercising their credit cards. 
The places renowned for breeding bunco, like the <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> neighborhood known as the "Maggot Mile" and <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>'s flashy strip of casinos, invariably offer fast cars, high rollers, glamorous women and lots of sunshine.
The rich image of <LOCATION>Newport Beach</LOCATION> also helps lend the con artists' operation an air of respectability. "One reason they use <LOCATION>Newport Beach</LOCATION> is that it sounds swankier than most addresses," says <PERSON>David Katz</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney who, until recently, headed a multi-agency <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> fraud task force. "<LOCATION>Newport Beach</LOCATION> is known in <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> for having a lot of rich people." 
Because only a fraction of them are ever prosecuted, nobody really knows how much money bogus telemarketing operators really harvest. "I've heard that there is $40 billion taken in nationwide by boiler rooms every year," <PERSON>Mr. McClelland</PERSON> says. "If that's true, <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> has to be at least 10% of that." 
And most of the truly big scams in <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> seem to originate in <LOCATION>Newport Beach</LOCATION> or one of the other well-heeled communities that surround this sliver-like city that hooks around a point of land on the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> coast south of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. 
In one ingenious recent example of a <LOCATION>Newport Beach</LOCATION> boiler room, prospective investors in <ORGANIZATION>Capital Trust Inc.</ORGANIZATION> were allegedly told that their investment in precious metals was insured against losses "caused by employees due to dishonesty, destruction or disappearance," according to an indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> last month.
<PERSON>Douglas Jones</PERSON>, an attorney representing <PERSON>Richard O. Kelly Sr.</PERSON>, the chairman and president of <ORGANIZATION>Capital Trust</ORGANIZATION>, says his client denies that there was any attempt to defraud investors. "There were some business deals that went bad," <PERSON>Mr. Jones</PERSON> says, "but no intent to defraud." <ORGANIZATION>Newport Beach</ORGANIZATION> operations differ from the <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> boiler rooms in style as well as in dollars.
But, says <PERSON>Mr. Katz</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney, "the interesting thing about <LOCATION>Newport Beach</LOCATION> operations is that they give themselves the indulgence of beautiful offices, with plush furnishings.
Investigators cite the case of <PERSON>Matthew Valentine</PERSON>, who is currently serving a six-year sentence at <ORGANIZATION>Lompoc Federal Prison</ORGANIZATION> for his role in <ORGANIZATION>Intech Investment Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which promised investors returns of as much as 625% on precious metals.
<PERSON>Mr. Valentine</PERSON>, who pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud in federal court in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, drove a leased Mercedes and lived in an expensive home on <ORGANIZATION>Lido Isle</ORGANIZATION>, an island in <LOCATION>Newport</LOCATION>'s harbor, according to investigators.
With the $3 million received from investors, he took frequent junkets with friends to exotic locales and leased an expensive BMW for his girlfriend, whom he met at the shop where he got his custom-tailored suits. "It's amazing the amount of money that goes up their nose, out to the dog track or to the tables in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Mr. Katz</PERSON> says. 
<ORGANIZATION>Vincent M Ciavarella</ORGANIZATION>, regional manager of <ORGANIZATION>Property Management Systems</ORGANIZATION>, insists he doesn't know of any bogus telemarketers operating in the 1.6 million square feet of office space around <LOCATION>Fashion Island</LOCATION> that his company leases for <ORGANIZATION>Irvine Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the owner and developer of the project.
<PERSON>Richard Luehrs</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Newport Harbor Area Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>, calls boiler rooms a "negative we wish we could get rid of." Actually, "we don't get much negative publicity about this," he insists, "except for the press who write about it."

AMONG THE CATFISH farmers in the watery delta land of <LOCATION>Humphreys County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Miss.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Allen D. Tharp</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Isola</LOCATION> was one of the best known and most enterprising. 
The returns landed in the hands of an <ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION> criminal investigator, <PERSON>Samuel James Baker</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr. Baker</PERSON> interviewed or wrote to hundreds of catfish farmers, live-haulers and processors throughout the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION> before coming up with detailed estimates of purchases and sales, in pounds and dollars, by <PERSON>Mr. Tharp</PERSON> and others. 
Unknown to <PERSON>Mr. Tharp</PERSON>, he had fouled his net on a special <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> project to catch catfish farmers and haulers inclined to cheat on their taxes.
The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> recently won part of its long-running battle with the <ORGANIZATION>Church of Scientology</ORGANIZATION> over exemptions when the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> held that members' payments to the church weren't deductible because the members received services in return. 
<LOCATION>San Franciscans</LOCATION> have a much higher incidence of audits than average because more of them score high under that formula, not because <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> agents envy their life styles. 
Passport applicants now must give <ORGANIZATION>Social Security</ORGANIZATION> numbers, enabling the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> to see whether Americans living abroad are filing required <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> returns. 
It prompted an <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> study that found many sellers were concealing income and treating large amounts of nondeductible travel and other personal expenses as business costs, <PERSON>Mr. Washburn</PERSON> says.
The <ORGANIZATION>Tax Court</ORGANIZATION> recently denied business deductions by <PERSON>Mr.</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mrs. Peter S. Rubin</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Cherry Hill</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, who both were part-time distributors of Amway products in addition to their regular jobs as sales people in other fields.
The <ORGANIZATION>Tax Court</ORGANIZATION> didn't believe that the <PERSON>Rubins</PERSON>, who earned $65,619 in their regular jobs, treated the sideline as a real business and derived "merely incidental elements of recreation and other personal pleasure and benefits" from it. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Direct Selling Association</ORGANIZATION>, a trade group, points out that its members, which include <ORGANIZATION>Amway Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, cooperate with the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> to distribute tax-compliance material to sales people and are helping to prepare a public-service television program on the subject. 
But many others, who want to qualify for employee benefits and unemployment compensation, become tipsters for the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>, says <PERSON>Jerry Lackey</PERSON>, who manages the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> project's force of nine agents in north and central <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Orlando</LOCATION>.
The state's tax enforcers have amassed data bases from other <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> agencies that license or register professionals and businesses; from exchange agreements with the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>, 24 other states, and two Canadian provinces, and even from phonebook Yellow Pages.
The state has combed through records relating to architects, stockbrokers, lawyers in the <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> area, construction workers from out of the state, and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states -- especially <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, which has no personal income tax.
In the early stage of checking people with incomes exceeding $500,000 who were filing nonresident returns, it squeezed $7.5 million out of a man who was posing as a <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> resident. "We think we can reclaim hundreds of millions of dollars just through the nonresident project," <PERSON>Mr. Hicks</PERSON> declares. 
"The risks for sterling of a bad trade figure are very heavily on the down side," said <PERSON>Chris Dillow</PERSON>, senior <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> economist at <ORGANIZATION>Nomura Research Institute</ORGANIZATION>.

<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Saab</ORGANIZATION> ended talks about a possible alliance after <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> concluded that the cost to modernize <PERSON>Saab</PERSON>'s car operations would outweigh the likely return.
The collapse Friday prompted speculation that <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> would intensify its pursuit of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, which is negotiating a defensive alliance with <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles</ORGANIZATION> said Friday it expects a $16 million quarterly loss, citing property-loan losses at its <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> unit.

<ORGANIZATION>Guillermo Ortiz</ORGANIZATION>'s Sept. 15 Americas column, "<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s Been Bitten by the Privatization Bug," is a refreshingly clear statement of his government's commitment to privatization, and must be welcomed as such by all Americans who wish his country well.
The <ORGANIZATION>Mexico-United States Institute</ORGANIZATION> is glad to see such a high official as <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s undersecretary of finance view his country's reforms "in the context of a larger, world-wide process" of profound change toward free-market economics, especially in the statist countries. 
Regrettably, too, <PERSON>Mr. Ortiz</PERSON> resorts to the familiar "numbers game" when he boasts that "fewer than 392 {state enterprises} currently remain in the public sector," down from the "1,155 public entities that existed in 1982." But the enterprises still in state hands include the biggest and most economically powerful ones in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>; indeed, they virtually constitute the economic infrastructure.
In language that sidesteps the issue, <PERSON>Mr. Ortiz</PERSON> writes, "The divestiture of nonpriority and nonstrategic public enterprises is an essential element of President <PERSON>Carlos Salinas</PERSON>'s plan to modernize <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s economy. . . ." Yet clearly, modernization must embrace its key industries before it can be said to have caught the "privatization bug." 
To guarantee that <ORGANIZATION>Mexicana de Aviacion</ORGANIZATION> and other companies will really be privatized, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> needs a pluri-party political system that will ensure democracy and hence accountability.

That's a big change from recent years when freight haulage was a bright spot for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> productivity, helping to restrain inflation and make <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> industry more competitive abroad. 
"Demand has caught up with the supply of certain types of freight transportation, and rates are starting to move up" at a rate "close to or slightly more than the inflation rate," said <PERSON>Clifford Sayre</PERSON>, director of logistics at <ORGANIZATION>Du Pont Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
Only 10% of the 250 shippers polled expected their freight-transport costs to decrease, compared with 30% who had looked to freight transport to reduce costs in past years. "This is the first year since transportation deregulation in 1980 that we have had such a dramatic and broad-based upturn in perceived transportation rates," said <PERSON>Bernard LaLonde</PERSON>, a transportation logistics professor at <LOCATION>Ohio State</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Robert Delaney</PERSON>, a consultant at <ORGANIZATION>Arthur D. Little Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, said "We've gotten all the benefits of deregulation in freight-cost reductions.
Not everyone believes that the good times are over for shippers. "There's still a lot of pressure on rates in both rail and truck," said <PERSON>Gerard McCullough</PERSON>, lecturer in transportation at <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>.
An official at <ORGANIZATION>Consolidated Freightways Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Menlo Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, less-than-truckload carrier, said rate discounting in that industry has begun to "stabilize." <ORGANIZATION>Consolidated Freightways</ORGANIZATION> plans to raise its rates 5.3% late this year or early next year, and at least two competitors have announced similar increases. 
Truckers are "trying to send signals that they need to stop the bloodletting, forget about market share and go for higher rates," said <PERSON>Michael Lloyd</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Bros</ORGANIZATION>.
Air-freight carriers raised their rates for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> products going across the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> by about 20% earlier this month.
Such rate increases "will increase the total cost of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> products and slow down the rate of increase of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> exports," said <PERSON>Richard Connors</PERSON>, a senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Yusen Air & Sea Service U.S.A. Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> air-freight-forwarding subsidiary of <PERSON>Nippon Yusen Kaisha</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
Some bulk shipping rates have increased "3% to 4% in the past few months," said <ORGANIZATION>Salomon</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Lloyd</PERSON>. 
Carriers boosted rates more than 10% in the North Atlantic between the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> last September, hoping to partly restore rates to earlier levels.
Ship lines operating in the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> plan to raise rates on containers carrying <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> exports to <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> about 10%, effective next April. 
Remember, though, that beta also has important limitations. "Beta is only part of the risk in a stock," says <PERSON>William F. Sharpe</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Stanford University</ORGANIZATION> emeritus professor who developed the measure. "There is risk that is not associated with market moves, and the beta doesn't tell you the magnitude of that." 
"People tend to see risk primarily on that one dimension," says <PERSON>Timothy Kochis</PERSON>, national director of personal financial planning for accountants <ORGANIZATION>Deloitte, Haskins & Sells</ORGANIZATION>. 
"That's the biggest risk of all -- the risk of not meeting your objectives," says <PERSON>Steven B. Enright</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> financial planner with <ORGANIZATION>Seidman Financial Services</ORGANIZATION>. 
Note that the younger couple's portfolio has a higher expected annual return, 10.1% vs. 8.8%, as calculated by <ORGANIZATION>Seidman Financial Services</ORGANIZATION>, which is the financial-planning affiliate of <ORGANIZATION>BDO Seidman</ORGANIZATION>.
"They may feel emotionally secure now because they are not heavily in the stock market," says <PERSON>John H. Cammack</PERSON>, a financial planner with <ORGANIZATION>Alexandra Armstrong Advisors Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. "But they may pay a price 10 or 20 years in the future."

The new <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard</ORGANIZATION> program, said analyst <PERSON>John McCarthy</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Forrester Research Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a computer-market research company, "is a key building block as people move to this new model of distributed processing." In today's computer networks, some machines often sit idle while others are overtaxed.
The program now works on all <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard</ORGANIZATION> and Apollo workstations and on computers made by <ORGANIZATION>Multiflow Computer Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Branford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard</ORGANIZATION> said it will sell versions later next year that run on <ORGANIZATION>Sun Microsystems Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment Corp.</ORGANIZATION> machines. 
A previously available program called <ORGANIZATION>Network Computing System</ORGANIZATION>, developed by <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard</ORGANIZATION>'s Apollo division, for instance, takes a task and splits it up into parts, divvying up those parts to several computers in a network for simultaneous processing.
Applications won't have to be rewritten to work with <ORGANIZATION>Task Broker</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard</ORGANIZATION> said, and the user of a computer won't be able to tell that another machine is doing the work.
The Task Broker "turns that network into -- as far as the user is concerned -- one giant computer," said <PERSON>Bill Kay</PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard</ORGANIZATION>'s workstation group. 
<ORGANIZATION>C. Olivetti & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, claiming it has won the race in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> to introduce computers based on a powerful new microprocessor chip, unveiled its CP486 computer yesterday. 
The product is the first from a <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> company based on <ORGANIZATION>Intel Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's new 32-bit 486tm microprocessor, which works several times faster than previously available chips.
<PERSON>An Olivetti</PERSON> spokesman said the company's factories are already beginning to produce the machine, and that it should be available in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> by December. "What this means is that Europeans will have these machines in their offices before Americans do," the spokesman said. 
The new chip "is a very big step in computing, and it is important that <PERSON>Olivetti</PERSON> be one of the first out on the market with this product," said <PERSON>Patricia Meagher Davis</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>James Capel & Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Ms. Davis</PERSON> said the new machines could steal some sales away from <PERSON>Olivetti</PERSON>'s own minicomputers, but would bring new sales among professionals such as engineers, stockbrokers and medical doctors.
Although <PERSON>Olivetti</PERSON>'s profits tumbled 40% in the first half of this year, she believes <PERSON>Olivetti</PERSON>'s restructuring last fall and its introduction of new products will begin to bear fruit with an earnings rebound next year, especially if it can fulfill its promise to deliver the new machines by December. "We think the worst is over" in the European information-technology market, she said. 
Depending on the type of software and peripherals used, the machines can serve either as the main computer in a network of many terminals (a role usually filled by a minicomputer), as a technical workstation or as a very fast personal computer. "It's the missing link" in <PERSON>Olivetti</PERSON>'s product line between small personal computers and higher-priced minicomputers, the <PERSON>Olivetti</PERSON> spokesman said.
He added that <PERSON>Olivetti</PERSON> will continue making its <ORGANIZATION>LSX</ORGANIZATION> minicomputer line. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION> 486 chip can process 15 million instructions per second, or <ORGANIZATION>MIPS</ORGANIZATION>, while <ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION>'s previous 386 chip could handle only 3 to 6 <ORGANIZATION>MIPS</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Olivetti</PERSON> also plans to sell the CP486 computer in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> starting next year through <ORGANIZATION>Olivetti USA</ORGANIZATION> and through its <ORGANIZATION>ISC/Bunker Ramo</ORGANIZATION> unit, which specializes in automating bank-branch networks. 
The <ORGANIZATION>British Petroleum Co</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>PLC</ORGANIZATION> said its <ORGANIZATION>BP Exploration</ORGANIZATION> unit has produced the first oil from its Don oilfield in the <LOCATION>North Sea</LOCATION>. 
Four workers at <ORGANIZATION>GTE Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's headquarters have been diagnosed as having hepatitis, and city health officials are investigating whether a cafeteria worker may have exposed hundreds of other <ORGANIZATION>GTE</ORGANIZATION> employees to the viral infection, company and city officials said. 
<ORGANIZATION>GTE</ORGANIZATION> shut down its cafeteria Tuesday afternoon after testing determined that at least one cafeteria worker employed by <ORGANIZATION>GTE</ORGANIZATION>'s private food vending contractor, <ORGANIZATION>ARA Services Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, was suffering from a strain of the virus, officials said.
"From a public health point of view we're relieved because hepatitis A is rarely life-threatening," said <PERSON>Dr. Frank Provato</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>GTE</ORGANIZATION>'s medical director. "It's a double-edged sword though, because it is also the most contagious kind of hepatitis." 
<ORGANIZATION>GTE</ORGANIZATION> officials began posting warning notices about the potential threat to exposure Wednesday morning at various places at the company, said <ORGANIZATION>GTE</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Thomas Mattausch</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Gregory Bessemer</PERSON>, who came in second in the stock division of the recently completed <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Trading Championship, says he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively when trading options. "I like to use them to feel out the market," he says. "If they don't fill it immediately, then I can start over at a new price or try again with the same price." 
<ORGANIZATION>Hoechst</ORGANIZATION> said the fertilizer market faces overcapacity in <LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION>, rising imports from <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> bloc countries and overseas, and declining demand. 
The new holding company, <ORGANIZATION>Webster/Eagle Bancorp Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, will have about $1.2 billion of assets and 19 banking offices in <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>.
In the merger, each share of <LOCATION>Webster</LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION>Waterbury</LOCATION>, will be converted into one share of the new company.
Each share of <ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Bristol</LOCATION>, will become 0.95 share of <ORGANIZATION>Webster/Eagle</ORGANIZATION>. 
In <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading Friday, <ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION> shares rose 12.5 cents to $11.
<PERSON>Frank J. Pascale</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION>, will be chairman of the new firm and <PERSON>James C. Smith</PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <PERSON>Webster</PERSON>, will take those posts at <ORGANIZATION>Webster/Eagle</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Harold W. Smith Sr.</PERSON>, chairman of <PERSON>Webster</PERSON>, will become chairman emeritus and a director of the new company.
<PERSON>Ralph T. Linsley</PERSON>, vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION>, will become vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Webster/Eagle</ORGANIZATION>.
At June 30, <PERSON>Webster</PERSON>, which owns <ORGANIZATION>First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Waterbury</ORGANIZATION>, had assets of $699 million.
Eagle, which controls <ORGANIZATION>Bristol Federal Savings Bank</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Torrington</ORGANIZATION>, had assets of $469.6 million on that date. 
<LOCATION>Becton</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Dickinson & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, for example, faces stiff competition from a Japanese supplier in the important syringe market.
The <LOCATION>Franklin Lakes</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, company is expected to report sales growth of only 5% to 6%, but should still maintain earnings growth of 10%, says <PERSON>Jerry E. Fuller</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Duff & Phelps Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
Sales for the company, based in <LOCATION>Abbott Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, rose 8.3% to $1.31 billion from $1.21 billion. 
Sales for the <LOCATION>Deerfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, company rose 5.8% to $1.81 billion from $1.71 billion. 
The <LOCATION>Murray Hill</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, company said full-year earnings may be off 33 cents a share because the company removed a catheter from the market.
Takeover speculation, which has been buoying stocks of supply houses, may also ease, says <PERSON>Peter Sidoti</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "As that wanes, you're going to see the stocks probably wane as well," he says. 
Bolstered by strong performances by its psychiatric hospitals, <ORGANIZATION>National Medical Enterprises Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, reported net income of $50 million, or 65 cents a share, for the first quarter ended Aug. 31, up from $41 million, or 56 cents a share, a year earlier.
<ORGANIZATION>Humana Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>, also reported favorable results, with net income of $66.7 million, or 66 cents, in the fourth quarter ended Aug. 31, up from $58.2 million, or 59 cents, a year earlier. 
Says <PERSON>Todd Richter</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Dean Witter Reynolds</ORGANIZATION>: "The shakeout in the publicly traded companies is over." 
The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> rejected a constitutional amendment that President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> sought to protect the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> flag from desecration. 
The vote, in which 11 <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> lawmakers voted against <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>'s position, was a victory for Democratic leaders, who opposed the amendment as an intrusion on the Bill of Rights. "We can support the <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> flag without changing the American Constitution," said <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON>George Mitchell</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>. 
In order to defuse pressure for an amendment, <PERSON>Mr. Mitchell</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON>Thomas Foley</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>) had arranged for lawmakers to pass a statute barring flag desecration before voting on the constitutional change.
In June, the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> threw out the conviction of a <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> man who set a flag afire during a 1984 demonstration, saying he was "engaging in political expression" that is protected by the First Amendment. 
In the wake of a slide in sterling, a tailspin in the stock market, and a string of problematic economic indicators, British Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON>Nigel Lawson</PERSON> promised gradual improvement in the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> economy. 
In a speech prepared for delivery to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s financial community, <PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON> summed up current economic policy as a battle to wring inflation out of the British economy, using high interest rates as "the essential instrument" to carry out the campaign.
<PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON> also dismissed the possibility of imposing direct credit controls on <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s financial system. 
<PERSON>Mr. Lawson</PERSON>'s speech, delivered at the Lord Mayor of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s annual dinner at <ORGANIZATION>Mansion House</ORGANIZATION>, came on the heels of a grueling period for the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> economy.
In a separate speech prepared for delivery at the dinner, <PERSON>Robin Leigh-Pemberton</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Bank of England</ORGANIZATION> governor, conceded that "demand pressures were even more buoyant than had been appreciated" when the British economy was heating up last year.
Although the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> market plunge prompted a 70.5-point drop in the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index, <PERSON>Mr. Leigh-Pemberton</PERSON> declared "that the experience owed nothing to the particular problems of the British economy." Specifically, he pointed out that compared with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market, the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> has far fewer highly leveraged junk-bond financings. 
Without the <ORGANIZATION>Adobe</ORGANIZATION> gain, <ORGANIZATION>Apple</ORGANIZATION>'s full-year operating profit edged up 1.5% to $406 million, or $3.16 a share, from $400.3 million, or $3.08 a share.
He surveys the prospective investors gathered in the board room of the <LOCATION>Philippine</LOCATION> government's <ORGANIZATION>Asset Privatization Trust</ORGANIZATION> for the sale of a 36% interest in the country's largest paper mill.
In October 1987, President <PERSON>Corazon Aquino</PERSON> vowed that her government would "get out of business" by selling all or part of the state's holdings in the many companies taken over by the government during the 20-year rule of <PERSON>Ferdinand Marcos</PERSON>.
In addition, the government is scheduled to unveil plans for privatizing <ORGANIZATION>Philippine Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, the national carrier, an effort that lawyer and business columnist <PERSON>Rodolfo Romero</PERSON> calls "the bellwether of privatization." All told, there are assets on the line valued at up to $1.03 billion. 
<PERSON>Ramon Garcia</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Asset Trust</ORGANIZATION>'s executive trustee, admits to what he calls "temporary setbacks." In light of the poor results recently, he says, the agency is adopting an "attitude of flexibility." 
In 1983, the loans were converted into equity, giving <ORGANIZATION>Manila</ORGANIZATION> 98% of the bank, but with the understanding that <PERSON>Mr. Ty</PERSON> had repurchase rights.
Separately, the government will try again within a month to sell the 36% stake in <ORGANIZATION>Paper Industries Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION>Picop</ORGANIZATION>, as the paper mill is known.
<PERSON>Mr. Garcia</PERSON> acknowledges the problem and says the <ORGANIZATION>Asset Trust</ORGANIZATION> will study why the bidding failed and what changes the agency may be able to offer.
<PERSON>Mr. Garcia</PERSON> says he has been notified of congressional hearings on the <ORGANIZATION>Picop</ORGANIZATION> bidding and possible legislation covering the paper mill's sale, both prompted by the criticism of the agency. 
<ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION> and other utmosts will cost no less. 
"You're not going to make it in a 5% bank account," says <PERSON>James Riepe</PERSON>, director of mutual funds at <ORGANIZATION>T. Rowe Price</ORGANIZATION>.
Several outfits -- including the <ORGANIZATION>Financial Programs</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Franklin</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>T. Rowe Price</ORGANIZATION> mutual-fund groups and the <PERSON>Edward D. Jones</PERSON> brokerage house -- are advertising "college planner" tables and charts that tell you how much you need to put aside regularly.
Not everyone is so pessimistic. "People are basically peddling a lot of fear," says <PERSON>Arthur Hauptman</PERSON>, a consultant to the <ORGANIZATION>American Council on Education</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
They have laid out about $1 billion for so-called baccalaureate zero-coupon municipal bonds -- so far offered by <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and eight other states.
And they have bought about $500 million in prepaid-tuition plans, offered in <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>.
But <PERSON>Richard Anderson</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Forum for College Financing Alternatives</ORGANIZATION>, at <ORGANIZATION>Columbia University</ORGANIZATION>, a research group partly financed by the federal government, says zeros are particularly ill-suited.
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> have backed up their guarantees with the full faith and credit of the state governments, meaning that taxpayers will pick up any slack.
<PERSON>Mr. Putka</PERSON> covers education from The <ORGANIZATION>Wall Street Journal</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> bureau. 
If you start saving for your child's eduction on Jan. 1, 1990, here's the monthly sum you will need to invest to pay for four years at <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>, Notre Dame and <ORGANIZATION>University of Minnesota</ORGANIZATION>.
But just down Seventh Avenue, where about 75% of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> fur garments are made, <PERSON>Larry Rosen</PERSON> has acquired two retail outlets, broadened his fur-making line and expanded into leather.
It also opened the door to furs made in <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> and other countries.
<PERSON>Seymour Schreibman</PERSON>, the 65-year-old owner of <ORGANIZATION>Schreibman Raphael Furs Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, treats the reverse side of a <LOCATION>Persian</LOCATION> lambskin to produce a reversible fur-and-leather garment.
This year he bought two stores, one in <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION>.
Large furriers such as <ORGANIZATION>Antonovich Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Fur Vault Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Evans Inc.</ORGANIZATION> all reported losses in their latest fiscal years.
And those who didn't move some production overseas suffer labor shortages. "The intensive labor needed to manufacture furs {in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>} is not as available as it was," says <PERSON>Mr. Schreibman</PERSON>, who is starting overseas production. 
But even those who have found a way to cope with the imports and the slump, fear that furs are losing part of their allure. "People are promoting furs in various ways and taking the glamour out of the fur business," says <PERSON>Stephen Sanders</PERSON>, divisional merchandise manager for <ORGANIZATION>Marshall Field</ORGANIZATION>'s department store in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. 
"You can't make a commodity out of a luxury," insists <PERSON>Mr. Purnick</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> furrier.
The <LOCATION>Hastings</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, concern makes piston rings, filters and fuel pumps. 
<PERSON>Thomas H. Johnson</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Coatedboard</ORGANIZATION> division of <ORGANIZATION>Mead Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, was named president of <ORGANIZATION>Manville Forest Products Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Manville</ORGANIZATION> unit, and senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Manville Corp</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Johnson</PERSON> succeeds <PERSON>Harry W. Sherman</PERSON>, who resigned to pursue other interests, in both positions.
In joining <ORGANIZATION>MIPS</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Control Data</ORGANIZATION> follows several competitors in embracing RISC as a new design approach. 
<ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Tandem Computers Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>NEC Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and Group Bull, among others, have similar arrangements with MIPs, based in <LOCATION>Sunnyvale</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. 
The accord with <ORGANIZATION>MIPS</ORGANIZATION> calls for <ORGANIZATION>Control Data</ORGANIZATION> to share its expertise in data storage, the companies said. 
Investor <PERSON>Asher Edelman</PERSON> increased his stake in <ORGANIZATION>Intelogic Trace Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and cleared the way for additional purchases. 
It wasn't clear, however, whether the actions were related to a battle between the corporate raider and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> attorney <PERSON>Martin Ackerman</PERSON> for control of <ORGANIZATION>Datapoint Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>, Texas-based data-processing systems maker. 
<ORGANIZATION>Intelogic Trace</ORGANIZATION>, a computer services company, was spun off to Datapoint holders in 1985, after <PERSON>Mr. Edelman</PERSON> gained control.
After <PERSON>Mr. Ackerman</PERSON> announced he was soliciting consents from shareholders in order to wrest control of Datapoint from <PERSON>Mr. Edelman</PERSON>, the corporate raider purchased 30% of <ORGANIZATION>Datapoint</ORGANIZATION>'s shares. 
In a <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> filing, <PERSON>Mr. Edelman</PERSON> said from Sept. 29 to Oct. 13, he acquired 309,500 shares of <ORGANIZATION>Intelogic</ORGANIZATION> common shares for $2.25 to $2.375 each.
The filing also said certain provisions which apply to persons acquiring 20% or more of <ORGANIZATION>Intelogic</ORGANIZATION> common stock, were waived by <ORGANIZATION>Intelogic</ORGANIZATION> for <PERSON>Mr. Edelman</PERSON>, who is chairman of the company.
The agreement also includes the purchase of <ORGANIZATION>Cross & Trecker</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Warner & Swasey</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>) <ORGANIZATION>AG</ORGANIZATION> unit by a <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> affiliate of <ORGANIZATION>Murata Machinery</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Cross & Trecker</ORGANIZATION> is also selling its equity interest in a <LOCATION>Japanese</LOCATION> joint venture, <PERSON>Murata Warner Swasey</PERSON>, to <ORGANIZATION>Murata Machinery</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Cross & Trecker</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Bloomfield Hills</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, machine-tool maker, said the net sales price of the total transaction is $24 million.
The <ORGANIZATION>Wiedemann</ORGANIZATION> division was one of three businesses put up for sale in <ORGANIZATION>Cross & Trecker</ORGANIZATION>'s restructuring program announced in July.
<ORGANIZATION>Cross & Trecker</ORGANIZATION> said negotiations are under way for the sale of another company, <ORGANIZATION>RobertsCorp</ORGANIZATION>. 
However, they said the company's flat revenue was a disappointment, and an indication that sales of <LOCATION>Polaroid</LOCATION>'s new conventional film in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> have been sluggish.
"I'm somewhat skeptical about the underlying demand" for Polaroid products, said <PERSON>Michael Ellmann</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Wertheim Schroder & Co.</ORGANIZATION> "If you believe that a good performance next year is contingent on an acceleration of revenue, there isn't a lot here to base optimism on." <PERSON>Alex Henderson</PERSON>, an analyst with Prudential-Bache, says <LOCATION>Polaroid</LOCATION> officials told him yesterday that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales of the company's new conventional film product, introduced in the second quarter, have been "disappointing" after a promising start. 
<PERSON>Sam Yanes</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Polaroid</LOCATION> spokesman, said "I don't know about disappointing," but added that the company hasn't been able to get the product on the shelves of some mass-merchandise, discount retailers that it had hoped would be carrying the product already.
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>Polaroid</ORGANIZATION> closed at $47, up $1.125. 
NEWSPAPERS: <ORGANIZATION>Media General Inc.</ORGANIZATION> intends to sell two of its <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> weekly newspaper chains, <ORGANIZATION>Golden West Publishing Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and Highlander Publications, which together comprise 31 papers.
<ORGANIZATION>Unilab Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Norcross</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, said it acquired the clinical laboratories of closely held <ORGANIZATION>Central Diagnostic Laboratory Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in a cash and securities transaction valued at $85 million. 
Beyond removing a competitor, the combination should provide "synergies," said <PERSON>Fred Harlow</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Unilab</ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer.
In <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, for example, Central has had a strong market position while <ORGANIZATION>Unilab</ORGANIZATION>'s presence has been less prominent, according to <PERSON>Mr. Harlow</PERSON>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it lowered ratings on about $650 million of <ORGANIZATION>Beatrice Co.</ORGANIZATION> debt, citing the closely held <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> food concern's proposed recapitalization. 
<ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION>'s said the proposed recaptilization may "limit the company's ability to realize its profit potential" and that paying dividends from a new series of preferred could squeeze "basic business operations." A <ORGANIZATION>Beatrice</ORGANIZATION> spokesman didn't return calls seeking comment. 
<ORGANIZATION>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> said a computer virus has infected one of its networks and is spreading anti-nuclear messages related to its <LOCATION>Galileo</LOCATION> space probe, which is to be launched today. 
<PERSON>Charles Redmond</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the agency discovered the virus on Monday on the collection of computer networks collectively called Internet and expected 100 university centers to be infected by today.
Although the network isn't connected to the computer systems that operate either <PERSON>Galileo</PERSON> or the shuttle, part of the network will carry analyses of <LOCATION>Galileo</LOCATION> data once the craft gets spaceborn. 
The intruder, among the broadest yet to hit a research network, appeared to affect only <ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment Corp.</ORGANIZATION> hardware that uses <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION>'s VAX/VMS operating system.
In the lingo of computer security, the <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> intruder is technically a computer worm, <PERSON>Mr. Redmond</PERSON> said.
The Galileo worm apparently was hatched on a computer in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> hooked up to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Space Physics Analysis Network</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Redmond</PERSON> said. 
<PERSON>Michael Alexander</PERSON>, a senior editor at <ORGANIZATION>Computerworld</ORGANIZATION>, a trade publication, said he was told that the worm gets into a computer center by looking for obvious passwords -- such as ones that are the same as the user's name.
In addition, <PERSON>Mr. Alexander</PERSON> said, the worm sends strange messages to other machines at the center -- such as, "<PERSON>George Orwell</PERSON> was an optimist," or "Don't feed the bats tonight." 
Activists fear that if the shuttle carrying <LOCATION>Galileo</LOCATION> into orbit should explode, or if Galileo itself crashes into the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> during the two times it flies close to the planet, fatal levels of plutonium would be released into the atmosphere. 
<PERSON>Mr. Alexander</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Computerworld</ORGANIZATION> said hackers have gone after SPAN before.
He said the <ORGANIZATION>Chaos Computer Club</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, once managed to invade SPAN and do such things as change the value of pi, messing up some calculations. 
The initial $11 million research program will conduct the most extensive testing to date of reformulated gasolines, said <PERSON>Joe Colucci</PERSON>, head of fuels and lubricants at <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> research laboratories.
"The whole idea here is the automobile and oil companies have joint customers," said <PERSON>Keith McHenry</PERSON>, a senior vice president of technology at <ORGANIZATION>Amoco Corp.</ORGANIZATION> "And we are looking for the most cost-effective way to clean up the air." 
But <PERSON>David Hawkins</PERSON>, an environmental lawyer with the <ORGANIZATION>Natural Resources Defense Council</ORGANIZATION>, said the research appears merely to be a way to promote reformulated gasoline. 
Oil and auto companies supported a move on <LOCATION>Capitol Hill</LOCATION> last week to gut <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>'s plans to require auto makers to begin selling alternative-fueled cars by 1995.
The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration has said it will try to resurrect its plan when the <ORGANIZATION>House Energy and Commerce Committee</ORGANIZATION> takes up a comprehensive clean-air bill. 
<ORGANIZATION>Hachette S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>European</LOCATION> media and publishing group, reported a small rise in its attributable first-half group profit, excluding exceptional items, to 133.8 million francs ($21.1 million) from 130.1 million francs a year earlier. 
Analysts said <PERSON>Hachette</PERSON>'s earnings in the second half might be boosted by a capital gain from the sale of the <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> headquarters of a newspaper-delivery company that is 49% owned by <PERSON>Hachette</PERSON>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Merck & Co.</ORGANIZATION> reported a 25% increase in earnings; <ORGANIZATION>Warner-Lambert Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's profit rose 22% and <ORGANIZATION>Eli Lilly & Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's net income rose 24%.
<LOCATION>Merck</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Rahway</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, continued to lead the industry with a strong sales performance in the human and animal health-products segment.
Mevacor, <ORGANIZATION>Merck</ORGANIZATION>'s new cholesterol-lowering drug, had higher sales than any other prescription medicine has ever achieved in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in the year following introduction, the company said.
Intense competition, however, led to unit sales declines for a group of <ORGANIZATION>Merck</ORGANIZATION>'s established human and animal-health products, including <ORGANIZATION>Aldomet</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Indocin</LOCATION>. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Merck</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at $75.25, up 50 cents. 
<LOCATION>Warner-Lambert</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Morris Plains</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, reported sales that were a record for any quarter and the eighth quarter in a row of 20% or more per-share earnings growth.
The segment's growth was led by sales of the cardiovascular drugs <PERSON>Lopid</PERSON>, a lipid regulator, and <PERSON>Dilzem</PERSON>, a calcium channel blocker. 
World-wide sales of <ORGANIZATION>Warner-Lambert</ORGANIZATION>'s non-prescription health-care products, such as Halls cough tablets, <PERSON>Rolaids</PERSON> antacid, and <PERSON>Lubriderm</PERSON> skin lotion, increased 3% to $362 million in the third quarter; <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales rose 5%. 
<ORGANIZATION>Warner-Lambert</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at $109.50 a share, up $1.50, in <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday. 
Earnings continued to pace sales because of a lower tax rate, profit from the renegotiation of the debt instrument received from <ORGANIZATION>Faberge Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in connection with <ORGANIZATION>Lilly</ORGANIZATION>'s sale of <ORGANIZATION>Elizabeth Arden Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in 1987, and net proceeds from the settlement of patent litigation at <ORGANIZATION>Lilly's Hybritech Inc.</ORGANIZATION> unit. 
Third-quarter sales of the <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION>, company rose 11% to $1.045 billion from $940.6 million.
<ORGANIZATION>Advanced Cardiovascular Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Cardiac Pacemakers Inc.</ORGANIZATION> units led growth in the medical-instrument systems division. 
<ORGANIZATION>Lilly</ORGANIZATION> shares closed yesterday in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> at $62.25, down 12.5 cents. 
<ORGANIZATION>US Facilities Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Robert J. Percival</PERSON> agreed to step down as vice chairman of the insurance holding company. 
In a statement, <ORGANIZATION>US Facilities</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Mr. Percival</PERSON>'s employment contract calls for him to act as a consultant to the company for two years.
<PERSON>Mr. Percival</PERSON> will be succeeded on an interim basis by <PERSON>George Kadonada</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>US Facilities</ORGANIZATION> chairman and president. 
<PERSON>Mr. Sloan</PERSON> plans to remain on the board until his current term expires in April 1991, a <LOCATION>Lance</LOCATION> spokesman said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Parsow Partnership Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Elkhorn Partners L.P.</ORGANIZATION> said they may seek proposals from third parties relating to a sale or restructuring of <ORGANIZATION>CACI International Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
In a filing with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Parsow</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Elkhorn</ORGANIZATION>, which together hold 8.685% of <ORGANIZATION>CACI</ORGANIZATION>'s common shares, said they think it is in the best interest of <ORGANIZATION>CACI</ORGANIZATION> stockholders that the company be sold. 
<ORGANIZATION>CACI</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, said it hadn't seen the filing by <LOCATION>Parsow</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Elkhorn</PERSON> and therefore had no comment. 
According to the filing, <LOCATION>Parsow</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Elkhorn</ORGANIZATION> are based in <LOCATION>Elkhorn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neb.</LOCATION>, and are controlled by the same general partner, <PERSON>Alan S. Parsow</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Paul Ely</PERSON>, general partner of <ORGANIZATION>Alpha Partners</ORGANIZATION>, a venture-capital firm based in <LOCATION>Menlo Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, was named a director of this computer company.
<PERSON>Mr. Ingersoll</PERSON> remains editor in chief of the company's recently launched daily, the <LOCATION>St. Louis Sun</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Robin Honiss</PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of this bank holding company, was elected to the additional posts of chairman, president and chief executive of the company's <ORGANIZATION>New England Savings Bank</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary.
<PERSON>William R. Attridge</PERSON> resigned those posts, as well as a seat on <ORGANIZATION>NESB</ORGANIZATION>'s board.
<ORGANIZATION>NESB</ORGANIZATION> is also the parent of <ORGANIZATION>Omnibank</ORGANIZATION>. 
The unit stabilized about midday <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> time at around 1.85 marks and 141 yen, prompting unconfirmed rumors that the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> had intervened to blunt the unit's tumble.
<PERSON>Marc M. Goloven</PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION>Manufacturers Hanover Trust</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said that while the figures appear to indicate a sadly deteriorating <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade performance, there's still enough positive news in the data to justify buying dollars. 
He said that while the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade gap with <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> has widened significantly, the trade deficit with Western <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> continues to narrow.
In <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Wednesday, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> currency opened for trading at 142.55 yen, unchanged from Tuesday's <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> close.
Later, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> currency fell to about 142.25 yen on news reports of the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> earthquake. 
Some analysts remain bullish and point out that the dollar continues to be well bid despite key rate increases in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, several weeks of aggressive dollar sales by the world central banks -- some traders estimate that the barrage of sales topped $12 billion -- and a 190-point plunge on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 
They note that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unit is trading at the upper end of the presumed target zones established by the <ORGANIZATION>Group of Seven</ORGANIZATION> trading partners.
The <ORGANIZATION>G-7</ORGANIZATION> comprises <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
They say that the recent injection of liquidity into the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> banking system has been modest, and they don't anticipate significant easing by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION>. 
But other analysts contend that while the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>'s move to loosen credit hasn't been aggressive, it nevertheless sends a clear signal that, at least for now, the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> has relaxed its grip on credit. 
On the <ORGANIZATION>Commodity Exchange</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, gold for current delivery settled at $367.40 an ounce, up 10 cents.
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>Rohm & Haas</ORGANIZATION> closed at $33 a share, down $1.75. 
Twelve hundred miles away, rangers at a <LOCATION>Napa County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, state park are among the many who don't quite share the enthusiasm.
"We were being overrun," says <PERSON>Steve Fiala</PERSON>, trails coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION>East Bay Regional Park District</ORGANIZATION>.
Even the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Forest Service</ORGANIZATION>, whose lenient "multiple-use" philosophy permits motorized vehicles on thousands of miles of its trails across the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, has begun to close some lands to the bikes, including major portions of the popular <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Crest Trail</ORGANIZATION>, which stretches from <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>Sierra</LOCATION> has been instrumental in securing a number of the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> bans.
But the club still insists that public lands ought to be closed to the bikes unless studies indicate the bikes won't injure the environment or other users. "I have a mountain bike, yet as a hiker I've been run off the road by kids careening down a fire trail on them," says <PERSON>Gene Coan</PERSON>, an official at <LOCATION>Sierra</LOCATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, echoing the concerns of many members. 
"People who feel that cyclists should be banned from an area aren't looking at the whole picture," complains <PERSON>Mark Langton</PERSON>, associate editor of <LOCATION>Mountain</LOCATION> and City Biking magazine in <LOCATION>Canoga Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Langton</PERSON>'s group, Concerned Off-Road <ORGANIZATION>Bicyclists Association</ORGANIZATION>, mounted petition drives to help keep open certain <LOCATION>Santa Monica Mountain</LOCATION> trails designated for closing.
Biking groups in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> have won similar concessions, says <PERSON>Tim Blumenthal</PERSON>, mountain bike editor of Bicycling magazine. 
While some are renegade riders who simply scorn regulations, much bad riding simply reflects ignorance that can be corrected through "education and peer pressure," says <PERSON>Jim Hasenauer</PERSON>, a director of the <ORGANIZATION>International Mountain Biking Association</ORGANIZATION>. "I think we're making progress." 
Representatives of the accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION>Ernst & Young</ORGANIZATION> and the securities firm of <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, hired by creditors to consult on <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s financial plans, told the committee in a private meeting yesterday that <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s latest plan to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection is far riskier than an earlier one which won the creditors' approval. 
At a later news conference here, <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> was exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and predicted it would emerge from Chapter 11 protection from creditors early next year, operating with more service than it originally had scheduled.
In July, <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> and its creditors agreed on a reorganization plan that called for <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> to sell $1.8 billion in assets and to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection at two-thirds its former size.
But after selling off pieces such as its <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> shuttle, its <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> hub and various planes, <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> hit a stumbling block.
Those routes, valued by the creditors' professionals at about $400 million, were to be sold to <ORGANIZATION>AMR Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION>.
A last-minute snag in negotiations with <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION>, over an unrelated lawsuit between <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> and another <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> unit, caused the deal to collapse. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ernst & Young</ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s plans will miss its projections of earnings before interest, tax and depreciation by $100 million, and that <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s plan presented no comfort level, according to a source present at yesterday's session. 
Experts from <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs</ORGANIZATION> estimated <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> would miss the same mark by $120 million to $135 million, the source said. 
At the news conference, <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Phil Bakes</PERSON> presented a far rosier assessment.
<PERSON>Mr. Bakes</PERSON> declined to give out <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s daily losses, but said he didn't expect <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> would have to dip into the cash from asset sales currently held in escrow.
The plan <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> hopes to pursue, he said, calls for <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> to have $390 million in cash by year's end.
In any event, some people familiar with the case question whether the court will act by January as forecast by <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Bakes</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> told reporters the reorganization <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> is pursuing would create a carrier 85% to 90% of the size of the pre-bankruptcy <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bonds also were hurt late in the day by a $4 billion offering by the <ORGANIZATION>Tennessee Valley Authority</ORGANIZATION> and the prospect of a huge amount of new agency debt. 
"Bond investors were hoping that stock prices would continue to fall," said <PERSON>Roger Early</PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Federated Investors Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>. "When stocks stabilized, that was a disappointment." 
"The intervention has been friendly, meaning that they really didn't have to do it," said <PERSON>Maria Fiorini Ramirez</PERSON>, money-market economist at <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
Traders said hedging related to the <ORGANIZATION>TVA</ORGANIZATION> pricing also pressured <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bonds. "Underwriters of the <ORGANIZATION>TVA</ORGANIZATION> bonds reduced their market risk by selling Treasurys to cover at least part of their {TVA} holdings," said <PERSON>James R. Capra</PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>TVA</ORGANIZATION> bonds also "served to remind the market that there will be even more new supply," said <PERSON>Lawrence N. Leuzzi</PERSON>, a managing director at <ORGANIZATION>S.G. Warburg Securities & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
Today the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> will announce the size of its next two-year note sale and <ORGANIZATION>Resolution Funding Corp.</ORGANIZATION> will announce details of its first bond offering.
Some traders estimate $9.75 billion of new two-year <ORGANIZATION>Treasurys</ORGANIZATION> will be sold next week, and they expect <ORGANIZATION>Refcorp</ORGANIZATION> to offer $4 billion to $6 billion of long-term "bailout" bonds.
The <ORGANIZATION>Office of Finance</ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Home Loan Banks</ORGANIZATION> said it priced a four-part $2.27 billion bond offering for the banks to yield from 8.125% to 8.375%. 
The <ORGANIZATION>TVA</ORGANIZATION>, which operates one of the nation's largest electric power systems, is a corporation wholly owned by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government.
Yesterday's bond sale was part of a $6.7 billion refinancing plan to pay off high-interest debt the <ORGANIZATION>TVA</ORGANIZATION> owes the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Financing Bank</ORGANIZATION>, an arm of the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>. 
The two Remics priced were a $500 million <ORGANIZATION>Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.</ORGANIZATION> issue underwritten by <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and a $350 million <ORGANIZATION>Federal National Mortgage Association</ORGANIZATION> deal underwritten by <ORGANIZATION>Greenwich Capital Markets</ORGANIZATION>. 
The Remic issuance supported prices of <ORGANIZATION>Freddie Mac</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Fannie Mae</ORGANIZATION> securities, which held up better than <ORGANIZATION>Government National Mortgage Association</ORGANIZATION> securities during an afternoon sell-off. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Ginnie Mae</ORGANIZATION> 9% issue was yielding 9.43% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> 10-year note held at 1.42 percentage points. 
Underwriters led by <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION> set preliminary pricing for $144.4 million of <ORGANIZATION>California Health Facilities Financing Authority</ORGANIZATION> revenue bonds for <PERSON>Kaiser Permanente</PERSON>.
As part of its <ORGANIZATION>College Savings Plan</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> offered $100.4 million of general obligation capital appreciation bonds priced to yield to maturity from 6.25% in 1994 to 6.90% in 2006, 2007 and 2009. 
West German government bond prices took a wild roller-coaster ride, pulled down by Monday's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stock market gains then up by a wider-than-expected <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade deficit and falling <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stock prices. 
<PERSON>Stephen N. Wertheimer</PERSON> was named managing director and group head of investment banking in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>.
Directors elected <PERSON>R. Marvin Womack</PERSON>, currently vice president/product supply, purchasing, to head the company's <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, office.
As vice president/national-government relations, <PERSON>Mr. Womack</PERSON> will work with <ORGANIZATION>P&G</ORGANIZATION>'s top management and with the company's government-relations staff "to represent P&G's interests at the federal level," said <PERSON>John G. Smale</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer.
<PERSON>Mr. Smale</PERSON> said the appointment "recognizes the growing influence of government on our business." <PERSON>Mr. Womack</PERSON>, 53 years old, has been with the big producer of household products, food and pharmaceuticals for 30 years. 
<PERSON>Mr. Nogales</PERSON>, former president of <ORGANIZATION>United Press International</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Univision</ORGANIZATION> Spanish-language network, most recently co-founded <ORGANIZATION>Nogales Castro Partners</ORGANIZATION>, a California-based media acquisition firm.
<PERSON>Mr. Nogales</PERSON>, the first Hispanic person to serve as a <ORGANIZATION>Coors</ORGANIZATION> director, is an addition to the board, increasing its membership to nine. 
<PERSON>William Seidman</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln Savings & Loan Association</ORGANIZATION> should have been seized by the government in 1986 to contain losses that he estimated will cost taxpayers as much as $2 billion. 
<PERSON>Mr. Seidman</PERSON>, who has been the nation's top bank regulator, inherited the problems of <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, after his regulatory role was expanded by the new savings-and-loan bailout law.
The inquiry also will cover the actions of <PERSON>Charles Keating Jr.</PERSON>, who is chairman of <ORGANIZATION>American Continental Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln</ORGANIZATION>'s parent, and who contributed heavily to several <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> senators. 
<PERSON>Mr. Seidman</PERSON> told the committee that the <ORGANIZATION>Resolution Trust Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the agency created to sell sick thrifts, has studied <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s examination reports by former regulators dating back to 1986. "My staff indicated that had we made such findings in one of our own institutions, we would have sought an immediate cease-and-desist order to stop the hazardous operations," <PERSON>Mr. Seidman</PERSON> said. 
When <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> was seized by the government, for example, 15% of its loans, or $250 million, were to borrowers who were buying real estate from one of <ORGANIZATION>American Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s 50 other subsidiaries, according to <PERSON>Mr. Seidman</PERSON>. 
But the government didn't step in until six months ago, when thrift officials put <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> into conservatorship -- the day after <ORGANIZATION>American Continental</ORGANIZATION> filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors.
Further investigation, he said, may result in further actions against <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s executives, said <PERSON>Mr. Seidman</PERSON>, "including fraud actions." <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON>, for his part, has filed suit alleging that regulators unlawfully seized the thrift. 
<PERSON>Leonard Bickwit</PERSON>, an attorney in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> for <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON>, declined to comment on the hearings, except to say, "We will be responding comprehensively in several forums to each of these allegations at the appropriate time." 
<PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s treatment by former thrift regulators, in an agency disbanded by the new law, has proved embarrassing for five senators who received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr. Seidman</PERSON> said yesterday, for example, that <PERSON>Sen. Dennis DeConcini</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>), who received $48,100 in contributions from <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON>, phoned <PERSON>Mr. Seidman</PERSON> to request that he push for a sale of <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION> before it would be seized. 
After the government lawsuit was filed against <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sen. DeConcini</PERSON> returned the campaign contributions.
The senator's spokesman said yesterday that he pushed for the sale of <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln</ORGANIZATION> because "hundreds of <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> jobs {at <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION>} were on the line." 
<ORGANIZATION>Senate Banking Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Donald Riegle</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>) has also returned contributions he received from <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> a year ago.
<PERSON>John Glenn</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>), <PERSON>John McCain</PERSON>, (R., <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>) and <PERSON>Alan Cranston</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>) also received substantial contributions from <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> and sought to intervene on behalf of <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>House Banking Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Henry Gonzalez</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>) said <PERSON>Sen. Cranston</PERSON> volunteered to appear before the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> committee, if necessary.
At the hearing, <PERSON>Mr. Seidman</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>RTC</ORGANIZATION> has already pumped $729 million into <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION> for liquidity.
In a move that could pose a new competitive challenge to <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's powerful <ORGANIZATION>Home Box Office</ORGANIZATION>, cable giant <ORGANIZATION>Tele-Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy half of <ORGANIZATION>Showtime Networks Inc.</ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION>Viacom Inc.</ORGANIZATION> for $225 million. 
The purchase comes after nearly three years of on-again off-again talks between <ORGANIZATION>TCI</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Viacom</ORGANIZATION>, which has also discussed the sale of an interest in Showtime with other cable operators.
Showtime is a distant No. 2 to <ORGANIZATION>Home Box Office</ORGANIZATION>, and in May filed a $2.5 billion antitrust suit against <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner</ORGANIZATION>, charging the company and its <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>American Television</ORGANIZATION> cable units with conspiring to monopolize the pay TV business. 
<ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION> has close to 24 million subscribers to its <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Cinemax</ORGANIZATION> networks, while Showtime and its sister service, The Movie Channel, have only about 10 million, according to <PERSON>Paul Kagan Associates</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Carmel</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, research firm. 
For <ORGANIZATION>TCI</ORGANIZATION>, the investment in Showtime puts it in an unusual position; as the largest cable operator, with control of close to 12 million of the nation's 52 million cable subscribers, <ORGANIZATION>TCI</ORGANIZATION> is <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION>'s largest customer.
But <ORGANIZATION>TCI</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>John Malone</PERSON> has long been concerned about <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION>'s dominance of the pay TV business, and has been eager to keep <PERSON>Showtime</PERSON> as a healthy competitor. "It is important to the cable industry that we have a vibrant and competitive pay-television marketplace," <PERSON>Mr. Malone</PERSON> said in a statement. 
In a telephone interview, <PERSON>Robert Thomson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>TCI</ORGANIZATION> senior vice president, said <PERSON>Showtime</PERSON>'s suit against <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION> "doesn't involve us, and nothing we're doing here bears any relationship to that." He added, "We don't intend to be drawn into it," noting that <ORGANIZATION>TCI</ORGANIZATION> won't play any active role in the management of Showtime. 
In addition to owning <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner</ORGANIZATION> owns <ORGANIZATION>American Television & Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the nation's second largest cable operator after <ORGANIZATION>TCI</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Viacom</ORGANIZATION> also owns cable systems, but it is the 14th largest operator of such systems, with less than one million subscribers. 
The <ORGANIZATION>TCI</ORGANIZATION> investment is a big victory for <ORGANIZATION>Viacom</ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer, <PERSON>Frank Biondi</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Winston H. Cox</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Showtime</ORGANIZATION> unit. "This takes any question of <PERSON>Showtime</PERSON>'s viability and puts it away once and for all," <PERSON>Mr. Biondi</PERSON> said in a telephone interview. 
The fight between <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION> and Showtime is particularly acrimonious because <PERSON>Mr. Biondi</PERSON> is the former chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Mr. Cox</PERSON> served as chief of marketing for the service.
They were both hired by <PERSON>Sumner Redstone</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> billionaire who took control of <ORGANIZATION>Viacom</ORGANIZATION> three years ago in a leveraged buy-out. 
<ORGANIZATION>Time Warner</ORGANIZATION> has vigorously denied all of <ORGANIZATION>Viacom</ORGANIZATION>'s allegations. 
<PERSON>Frank Carlucci III</PERSON> was named to this telecommunications company's board, filling the vacancy created by the death of <PERSON>William Sobey</PERSON> last May.
<PERSON>Mr. Carlucci</PERSON>, 59 years old, served as defense secretary in the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration.
"It's madness -- that in an hour you can whack off so much value," says <PERSON>Stanford Calderwood</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Trinity Investment Management Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Richard Bernstein</PERSON>, senior quantitative analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch & Co</ORGANIZATION>, says, "My gut feel is that we'll live with those swings for a while." 
"Institutions are herding animals," says <PERSON>Peter Anderson</PERSON>, who heads the pension-fund management arm of <ORGANIZATION>IDS Financial Services Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "We watch the same indicators and listen to the same prognosticators.
On Monday, for instance, <ORGANIZATION>Howard Ward</ORGANIZATION>, a principal at Scudder, <ORGANIZATION>Stevens & Clark</ORGANIZATION>, found that "you couldn't buy blue-chips at quoted prices without paying up." And when many firms had to "pay up," Monday's sudden rally was sparked. 
These and other modern trading methods "tend to promote dramatic shifts in assets," says <PERSON>George Douglas</PERSON>, first vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "It's the idea that what goes in easy can come out easy" -- so that bouts of higher volatility get built into the stock market. 
For instance, <ORGANIZATION>First Quadrant Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, an asset allocator based in <LOCATION>Morristown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, said it quickly boosted stock positions in its "aggressive" accounts to 75% from 55% to take advantage of plunging prices Friday.
Wall Street traders say that, with institutional brokerage commissions far lower than in the 1970s, securities firms can't afford to take the risk of buying too much stock. "I think everyone's a little more leery," says <PERSON>Jack Baker</PERSON>, head of equity trading at <ORGANIZATION>Shearon Lehman Hutton Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "The institutions have driven (commission) rates down to the point where it makes no sense to commit capital," says <PERSON>Tom Gallagher</PERSON>, senior executive vice president in charge of institutional trading at <ORGANIZATION>Oppenheimer & Co.</ORGANIZATION> "Why should I risk money for a guy for who's paying me five cents a dance?
<PERSON>Scott Black</PERSON>, a value-oriented money manager who heads <ORGANIZATION>Delphi Management Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, points out that for those who invest on fundamentals, "the value of a stock from day to day doesn't change all that much." 
<PERSON>Hans Stoll</PERSON>, finance professor at <ORGANIZATION>Vanderbilt University</ORGANIZATION>, says the current volatility in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> markets pales in comparison to the 1930s, decades before derivative instruments such as options and futures were introduced. "I just can't believe that the innovations in the financial market are causing any of this volatility," he says. 
And <PERSON>Robert D. Arnott</PERSON>, president of asset allocator First Quadrant, notes that before Friday's tailspin, daily volatility on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> in recent weeks had reached "historically low levels." 
<PERSON>John J. Phelan Jr.</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>, asserts that "1988 and 1989 have been two of the least volatile years in the last 30 or 40 years." 
In addition, <PERSON>Sanford Grossman</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Wharton School</ORGANIZATION> finance professor, says volatile jumps in stock prices will continue as long as liquidity falls short of the voracious demands of institutions "who can go out and say `I have a billion dollars of stocks to sell. '" 
<ORGANIZATION>L.J. Hooker Corp.</ORGANIZATION> is expected to reach an agreement in principle this week to sell <ORGANIZATION>Merksamer Jewelers Inc.</ORGANIZATION> to management, say executives familiar with the talks. 
<ORGANIZATION>L.J. Hooker</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year.
Currently, its parent company, <ORGANIZATION>Hooker Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, is being managed by a court-appointed liquidator. 
It is expected that <ORGANIZATION>GE Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a financial-services subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION>, will provide much of the funding for the proposed leveraged buy-out of <LOCATION>Merksamer</LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>GE Capital</ORGANIZATION> has a working relationship with <PERSON>L.J. Hooker</PERSON>.
It is providing $50 million in emergency financing to the company and has agreed to buy as much as $75 million in receivables from <ORGANIZATION>B. Altman & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Bonwit Teller</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>L.J. Hooker</PERSON>'s two fully owned department-store chains. 
<PERSON>Sam Merksamer</PERSON>, chief executive officer of the nationwide jewelry chain, and <PERSON>Sanford Sigoloff</PERSON>, chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>L.J. Hooker Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, both declined to comment. 
Currently, <PERSON>Mr. Merksamer</PERSON> owns 20% of the company; <ORGANIZATION>L.J. Hooker</ORGANIZATION> acquired its 80% interest in the firm in May 1986.
According to those familiar with the situation, other bidders included <ORGANIZATION>Ratners Group PLC</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Kay Jewelers Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp.</ORGANIZATION> is advising <PERSON>L.J. Hooker</PERSON> on the sale of the Merksamer business. 
<PERSON>Merksamer</PERSON> was the first in a series of retail acquisitions made by <ORGANIZATION>L.J. Hooker</ORGANIZATION>.
The company was founded in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> in 1929 by two brothers, <PERSON>Ralph</PERSON> and <PERSON>Walter Merksamer</PERSON>, who operated as <ORGANIZATION>DeVon</ORGANIZATION>'s Jewelers.
In 1979, the pair split the company in half, with <PERSON>Walter</PERSON> and his son, <PERSON>Sam</PERSON>, agreeing to operate under the Merksamer Jewelery name. 
The sale of <ORGANIZATION>Merksamer Jewelers</ORGANIZATION> is subject to approval by <PERSON>Judge Tina Brozman</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Bankruptcy Court</ORGANIZATION>. 
As earlier reported, <PERSON>L.J. Hooker</PERSON> this week received a $409 million bid for its three shopping malls, plus other properties from a consortium led by <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> real-estate investor <PERSON>Jay Shidler</PERSON> and <PERSON>A. Boyd Simpson</PERSON>, an <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> developer and former <PERSON>L.J. Hooker</PERSON> senior executive.
The offer, which didn't include the <ORGANIZATION>Merksamer</ORGANIZATION> chain, is being reviewed by <PERSON>Mr. Sigoloff</PERSON>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Daimler-Benz</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Edzard Reuter</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>Milan's financial daily Il Sole</ORGANIZATION> 24 Ore that talks are taking place between both companies' aerospace units. 
"While <PERSON>Mr. Reuter</PERSON>'s comments please us very much, there currently are no talks in progress regarding the automotive industry," a <ORGANIZATION>Fiat</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said. 
<PERSON>Roberto Morelli</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> analyst for <ORGANIZATION>County Natwest Securities</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, said that right now "the market isn't being influenced by that kind of news," referring to the conditional nature of the talks mentioned by <PERSON>Mr. Reuter</PERSON> and by the uncertainty surrounding world stock exchanges this week. 
According to one analyst, <PERSON>Bernard Savaiko</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the stock market's ability on Monday to rally from last Friday's decline -- which seemed to indicate that the economy wasn't going to fall either -- took the starch out of precious metals prices, and out of gold's, in particular. 
<PERSON>Jeffrey Nichols</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>APMS Canada</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> precious metals advisers, said there is little to motivate gold traders to buy the metal. "Investors in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> are comfortable with the actions of the {Federal Reserve} in its willingness to supply liquidity to financial system, which helped the stock market rebound on Monday," he said. 
<PERSON>Dinsa Mehta</PERSON>, chief bullion trader for <ORGANIZATION>Chase Manhattan Bank</ORGANIZATION>, said: "There is little incentive on the part of traders to sell gold because the stock market may go lower and gold may retain some of its `flight to safety' quality.
<PERSON>Mr. Mehta</PERSON> observed that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> merchandise trade deficit, which rose sharply in August, according to yesterday's report, has been having less and less impact on the gold market. "The dollar hasn't reacted much to it, so gold hasn't either," he said. 
According to an analyst, <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> can't meet all its shipment commitments and has asked <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to accept a delay of shipments scheduled for later this year, into early next year. "<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> is perceived as a wealthy nation that can turn elsewhere in the world market and buy the sugar," the analyst said.
GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: The prices of most soybean and soybean-meal futures contracts rose amid rumors that the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> is interested in buying from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> about 250,000 metric tons of soybeans and as many as 400,000 metric tons of soybean meal.
Traders are especially sensitive to reports of possible <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> soybean sales because <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> exports are lagging.
A spokesman attributed the bulk of a 14% increase in selling, administrative and general expenses -- to $324.9 million -- to marketing costs. "They're out there promoting like crazy, trying to get prices up by promotion," said <PERSON>Roy Burry</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Kidder, Peabody & Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
Separately, <LOCATION>Purchase</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>N.Y.-based PepsiCo Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, as expected, said fiscal third-quarter net rose 11% to $269.3 million, or $1.02 a share, from $241.6 million, or 91 cents a share.
In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola Enterprises</ORGANIZATION> closed at $16.375 a share, down 62.5 cents.
Its effectiveness can't be determined until a large clinical trial is undertaken by the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> in January, according to <PERSON>Robert Redfield</PERSON>, chief of acquired immune deficiency syndrome research at <ORGANIZATION>Walter Reed Army Institute of Research</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Dr. Redfield</PERSON>'s report on early experiments using an AIDS vaccine made by <ORGANIZATION>MicroGeneSys Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>West Haven</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, came at a meeting of AIDS vaccine researchers in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> late Monday.
<ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON>Fred T. Goldberg</PERSON> said the changes are intended to bring "accountability" to the agency, which has an annual budget of more than $5 billion and collects about $1 trillion a year. 
<PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON>, who took over as head of the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> in July, has been disturbed by what he considers the inefficiency, waste and lack of coordination among the branches of the vast federal agency. 
<ORGANIZATION>Rockwell International Corp.</ORGANIZATION> 's <LOCATION>Tulsa</LOCATION> unit said it signed a tentative agreement extending its contract with <ORGANIZATION>Boeing Co.</ORGANIZATION> to provide structural parts for <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION>'s 747 jetliners. 
Under the existing contract, <ORGANIZATION>Rockwell</ORGANIZATION> said, it has already delivered 793 of the shipsets to <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Rockwell</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>El Segundo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, is an aerospace, electronics, automotive and graphics concern. 
Tenders for the bills, available in minimum $10,000 denominations, must be received by 1 p.m. EDT Monday at the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> or at <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> banks or branches. 
"There is talk of some revamping and we're certainly heading in the direction of less and less animation," said <PERSON>Joseph S. Cicero</PERSON>, vice president of finance and administration for <ORGANIZATION>National Broadcasting Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Cicero</PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION>NBC Entertainment</ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON>Brandon Tartikoff</PERSON>, who declined to be interviewed, is "looking at options now and may put some things into the schedule by mid-season." He declined to elaborate. 
One major <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> affiliate, <ORGANIZATION>KCRA</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>, plans to cancel the NBC Saturday morning line-up as of January and replace it with a local newscast.
"We feel there is an opportunity for an audience that is not being served by any network, so we want to take the lead," says <ORGANIZATION>KCRA</ORGANIZATION>'s general manager, <PERSON>John Kueneke</PERSON>. "We don't need cartoons anymore.
An <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> spokesman says the network will "closely monitor" the <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> situation, and says it is the only station to defect.
Spokesmen for the television networks of <ORGANIZATION>CBS Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Capital Cities/ABC Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, say there are no plans to alter the children's line-up on Saturday mornings. 
At the same time, there appears to be a market for news-oriented programming; <ORGANIZATION>Turner Broadcasting System Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Cable News Network</ORGANIZATION> has its highest ratings, outside of prime time, on Saturday mornings. 
<ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> has on previous occasions considered replacing cartoons with a Saturday version of "Today," which is produced by <ORGANIZATION>NBC News</ORGANIZATION>.
The network's own production company, <ORGANIZATION>NBC Productions</ORGANIZATION>, supplies a half-hour family-oriented show titled "Saved By The <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION>." NBC Productions or <ORGANIZATION>NBC News</ORGANIZATION> could supply the network with other Saturday morning shows, a move that would control costs.
Nothing stirred the soul of <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> and his disciples as much as the crusade to aid <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>'s Contra rebels, or the dream of building a space-based defense shield to knock out Soviet nuclear missiles. 
Yet under <PERSON>Mr. Reagan</PERSON>'s preferred successor, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, those two cherished national-security causes are withering on the vine.
"The programs have arthritis," says Rep. <PERSON>Henry Hyde</PERSON>, a conservative Republican from <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>.
It isn't surprising that President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> hasn't led a crusade to pump up the Contras or SDI. Though he nominally supports both programs, <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> hasn't been a passionate champion of either cause, as <PERSON>Mr. Reagan</PERSON> was. 
"We want to complain, we want to say something about it, and we're going to as it gets worse," says Rep. <PERSON>Dan Burton</PERSON>, an <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> Republican who has been a staunch Contra backer. "But it's like kicking your father in the pants.
You hate to do it because he's your father." <PERSON>Mr. Burton</PERSON> says conservatives' unhappiness with <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>'s cautious handling of the recent unsuccessful coup in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> will make them more willing to speak out. 
Of course, neither President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> nor the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> has actually abandoned the Contras or <ORGANIZATION>SDI</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> has struck a deal with congressional leaders to provide nonlethal aid to the Contras until <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> holds national elections next February. 
Instead of focusing on the Contras, <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> has switched to urging members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> -- most recently in a White House meeting yesterday -- to approve financing for the election campaign of political opponents of <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Sandinista</LOCATION> government. 
The administration continues to support SDI, or <ORGANIZATION>Star Wars</ORGANIZATION>, and it recently lobbied to persuade the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> to restore some of the funds it planned to cut from the program.
And just last week, <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Dick Cheney</PERSON> gave a strong speech listing "compelling reasons" to push ahead with SDI and saying he'd urge President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to veto a defense bill with "inadequate" funding for the program. 
But the strong pitch by <PERSON>Mr. Cheney</PERSON> may be too little too late to prevent damage to <ORGANIZATION>SDI</ORGANIZATION>.
And while the <ORGANIZATION>defense</ORGANIZATION> secretary is speaking out, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> himself hasn't launched any high-visibility campaign to drum up support, as President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> did.
The administration also acknowledges that it isn't pursuing <PERSON>Mr. Reagan</PERSON>'s original vision of an "impenetrable shield" protecting the whole <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, but rather a more modest version. 
More ominous to <ORGANIZATION>SDI</ORGANIZATION> supporters, the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration appears to have tacitly accepted a new arms-control proposal from the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> that spells long-term trouble for <ORGANIZATION>Star Wars</ORGANIZATION>.
It will be hard down the road to persuade <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to approve money for <ORGANIZATION>SDI</ORGANIZATION> plans if lawmakers fear those plans could scuttle a completed treaty.
As a result, <PERSON>Frank Gaffney</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>Reagan Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> aide who now heads the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Security Policy</ORGANIZATION>, charges that the administration's "professions of continued commitment to development and deployment of the <ORGANIZATION>SDI</ORGANIZATION> program strain credulity." 
In fact, because communism seems to be beating a global retreat, some conservatives may simply be so pleased that their anti-communist philosophy is prevailing that they don't have the fire at the moment to push controversial programs. "The short of it is that the most hard-bitten among us cannot get into too sour a mood with communism collapsing," says <PERSON>Mitchell Daniels</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>Reagan White House</ORGANIZATION> aide who now is president of the <ORGANIZATION>Hudson Institute</ORGANIZATION>. 
One longtime champion of these programs in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, Republican whip <PERSON>Newt Gingrich</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, is distracted by questions about his ethics, conservatives note.
Other conservative champions, like Wyoming Republican <PERSON>Sen. Malcolm Wallop</PERSON>, a longtime SDI advocate, don't have the clout with the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> White House that they enjoyed with President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>. 
Above all, though, proponents say neither the <ORGANIZATION>Contra</ORGANIZATION> nor the SDI cause can be pushed much further without more presidential support. "For there to be wind in the sails of any program, the chief executive has to be blowing in the sails," says Rep. <PERSON>Burton</PERSON>. 
"What I'd like to see, if he is up to it, is for <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> to take to the hustings to regenerate enthusiasm for <ORGANIZATION>SDI</ORGANIZATION>," the congressman says. 
Eight months after Gen. <PERSON>Boris Gromov</PERSON> walked across the bridge into the <LOCATION>U.S.S.R.</LOCATION>, a Soviet-controlled regime remains in <LOCATION>Kabul</LOCATION>, the refugees sit in their camps, and the restoration of Afghan freedom seems as far off as ever. 
With the February 1987 <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> accords "relating to <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>," the Soviet Union got everything it needed to consolidate permanent control.
The terms of the <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> accords leave <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> free to provide its clients in <LOCATION>Kabul</LOCATION> with assistance of any kind -- including the return of Soviet ground forces -- while requiring the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> to cut off aid.
The only fly in the Soviet ointment was the last-minute addition of a unilateral <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> caveat, that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> aid to the resistance would continue as long as Soviet aid to <LOCATION>Kabul</LOCATION> did.
Gen. <PERSON>Gromov</PERSON> himself said Soviet troops expected to leave behind more than $1 billion of military equipment and installations for the <LOCATION>Kabul</LOCATION> regime.
Since the troop withdrawal, <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> has poured in an additional $200 to $300 million worth per month -- nearly $2 billion since February, equivalent to the total <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> aid to the resistance in nine years.
By September, a new <ORGANIZATION>Reinforced Motorized Rifle Brigade</ORGANIZATION> with an additional 300 combat vehicles, 1,000 more trucks and 10,000 Soviet-trained Afghan troops had arrived in <LOCATION>Kandahar</LOCATION>.
In the last few weeks, <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> has added FROG-7B missiles, the bomber version of the An-12, MiG-23BN high-altitude aircraft, MiG-29s, which can outfly <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s U.S.-built F16s, and <ORGANIZATION>Sukhoi</ORGANIZATION> SU-27 fighter-bombers, which can outfly the MiG-29s. 
<LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> claims this is all needed to protect the <LOCATION>Kabul</LOCATION> regime against the guerrilla resistance.
But this is not the entire <LOCATION>Afghan</LOCATION> army, and it is no longer <LOCATION>Kabul</LOCATION>'s only military force.
Complete units have been trained and indoctrinated in the <LOCATION>U.S.S.R.</LOCATION> and other <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> bloc nations; 30,000 to 40,000 of these troops have returned. 
In addition, the regime has established well-paid paramilitary forces totaling more than 100,000, including 35,000 Soviet-trained troops of the <ORGANIZATION>Interior Ministry</ORGANIZATION> (KHAD/WAD), which still is directed by 1,500 Soviet <ORGANIZATION>KGB</ORGANIZATION> officers.
In preparation for the withdrawal, <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kabul</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> signed two agreements for several hundred newly civilian Indian experts to replace some of the more visible Soviet military personnel.
The Soviets cut a deal with <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>: a future Iranian role in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> in exchange for Iranian support of Soviet policy.
Before his assassination in 1988, President <PERSON>Zia</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> repeatedly stated that fresh Soviet troops were being inserted into <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> even as others were ostentatiously withdrawn.
Rep. <PERSON>Bill McCollum</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>) reports that these included 20,000 to 30,000 Soviet Central Asian KGB Border Guards, ethnically indistinguishable from Afghans and wearing unmarked uniforms. 
In this they are aided by years of <LOCATION>American</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>European</LOCATION>, Pakistani and <LOCATION>Saudi</LOCATION> support for the most extreme factions -- radical Islamic fanatics with leaders whose policies are anathema to the <LOCATION>Afghan</LOCATION> public.
Instead, they were pressured by <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>ISI</ORGANIZATION>, the channel for their support, into attacking <LOCATION>Jalalabad</LOCATION>.
Last summer, in response to congressional criticism, the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> said they had resumed military aid to the resistance months after it was cut off; but it is not clear how much is being sent or when it will arrive.
<LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kabul</LOCATION> must have found that information useful. 
<PERSON>Ms. Klass</PERSON>, editor and co-author of "Afghanistan: The Great Game Revisited" (<ORGANIZATION>Freedom House</ORGANIZATION>), directs the <ORGANIZATION>Freedom House</ORGANIZATION> program on <LOCATION>Afghanistan/Southwest Asia</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>MacMillan Bloedel</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>British Columbia</LOCATION>, forest products concern, said the 8.1% loan is due Oct. 16, 1996.
A report in this week's issue of the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION> also projects that overall <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> mortality rates from lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death, should begin to drop in several years if cigarette smoking continues to abate. 
The report, which comes 25 years after the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Surgeon General issued a report warning against the dangers of smoking, is the strongest indication to date that the reduction in smoking is leading to lower death rates from lung cancer. "What this is saying is that the surgeon general's message is having an impact," said <PERSON>Melvyn Tockman</PERSON>, an epidemiologist at the <ORGANIZATION>Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>. 
The study, by <PERSON>Susan Devesa</PERSON>, <PERSON>William Blot</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joseph Fraumeni</PERSON> of the institute's staff, also shows that the incidence of lung cancer as well as the death rate declined over the decade for all groups in the 35-44 age bracket, except black men. 
An editorial in the <ORGANIZATION>NCI Journal</ORGANIZATION> says the report of declining lung-cancer mortality "among young men and women in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> indicates that we finally may be winning the battle -- this even in a country where the tobacco industry spends over $2 billion a year for promotion of the addictive habit of smoking." 
But the editorial, by <PERSON>Jan Stjernsward</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>World Health Organization</ORGANIZATION>, notes that tobacco consumption and lung-cancer mortality rates are rising in developing countries. "Non-smoking should be established as the norm of social behavior" around the world, the editorial says, through the enactment of laws that limit advertising, boost tobacco prices and promote anti-smoking education. 
Asked for comment, <PERSON>Walker Merryman</PERSON>, a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>Tobacco Institute</ORGANIZATION>, said new efforts to restrict tobacco advertising in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> could violate the First Amendment protection of free speech. 
<PERSON>Reuben Mark</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Colgate-Palmolive Co.</ORGANIZATION>, said he is "comfortable" with analysts' estimates that third-quarter earnings rose to between 95 cents and $1.05 a share.
<PERSON>Mr. Mark</PERSON> attributed the earnings growth to strong sales in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
Results were also bolstered by "a very meaningful" increase in operating profit by <ORGANIZATION>Colgate</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> business, <PERSON>Mr. Mark</PERSON> said. 
Operating profit at <ORGANIZATION>Colgate</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> household products and personal-care businesses jumped 25% in the quarter, <PERSON>Mr. Mark</PERSON> added.
The estimated improvement in <LOCATION>Colgate</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> operations took some analysts by surprise.
Analysts estimate <ORGANIZATION>Colgate</ORGANIZATION>'s sales of household products in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> were flat for the quarter, and they estimated operating margins at only 1% to 3%. "If you could say their business in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> was mediocre, but great everywhere else, that would be fine," says <PERSON>Bonita Austin</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Wertheim Schroder & Co.</ORGANIZATION> "But it's not mediocre, it's a real problem." 
<PERSON>Mr. Mark</PERSON> conceded that <ORGANIZATION>Colgate</ORGANIZATION>'s domestic business, apart from its highly profitable Hill's Pet Products unit, has lagged. "We've done a lot to improve {<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>} results, and a lot more will be done," <PERSON>Mr. Mark</PERSON> said. "Improving profitability of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> operations is an extremely high priority in the company." 
<PERSON>George L. LaMore</PERSON>, president and chief executive officer, will become chairman and chief executive upon <PERSON>Mr. Cunin</PERSON>'s retirement.
<PERSON>Mr. Dannemiller</PERSON>, 51, joined Bearings in August 1988 from <ORGANIZATION>Leaseway Transportation Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, where he was president and chief operating officer.
Soviet leader <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON> opened a major <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade exhibition in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> and spent two hours touring some of the 150 stalls representing such blue-chip companies as <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Johnson & Johnson</ORGANIZATION>.
At the <ORGANIZATION>Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.</ORGANIZATION> stand, <PERSON>Mrs. Nelson Rockefeller</PERSON>, a board member, offered him a soy burger.
The Soviet president and his prime minister, <PERSON>Nikolai Ryzhkov</PERSON>, spent the longest time, about 15 minutes, at the <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> stand, where they got souvenir computer-chip key rings.
At the <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> stall, they barely looked at a gleaming <ORGANIZATION>Cadillac</ORGANIZATION>, preferring to talk about cooperation possibilities. 
In <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>, meantime, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> opened an international aviation show, but the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>'s embargo on military deals and uncertainty about the nation's stability kept many foreign exhibitors away.
<PERSON>Judge Masaaki Yoneyama</PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION>Osaka District Court Daikin</ORGANIZATION>'s "responsibility is heavy because �illegal exports� lowered international trust in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>." Sale of the solution in concentrated form to Communist countries is prohibited by Japanese law and by international agreement. 
The newspaper <PERSON>Leninskoye Zamya</PERSON> said the committee decided the plan to parcel out economic powers previously exercised by <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> to the country's 15 republics "doesn't reflect the radical changes in the Soviet federation." The committee gave the government until Nov. 15 to revise the proposal.
<ORGANIZATION>Scott Paper Co.</ORGANIZATION> said it is abandoning a proposed $650 million tree-farming project in <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> because it no longer expects to use as much eucalyptus pulp as previously anticipated.
The eucalyptus plantation and pulp mill, which would have covered about 175,000 acres in the <LOCATION>Irian Jaya</LOCATION> region, had been approved by <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>'s investment board.
<ORGANIZATION>Yaohan Departmentstore Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> is moving its international-operations headquarters and holding company to <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> to gain from the British colony's economic advantages and tax structure.
With funds of 5.56 billion <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> dollars (US$712 million), the new company, <ORGANIZATION>Yaohan International Co.</ORGANIZATION>, plans to acquire 10 of <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s top restaurants.
It also intends to set up an international wholesale market with the <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> government next May and to open a department store in <LOCATION>Bangkok</LOCATION> and shopping centers in <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> by December 1990.
The chain currently has 90 retail outlets in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, seven in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, three in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> and a dozen more scattered around the globe. 
<PERSON>Christie</PERSON>'s will soon have a sale of <LOCATION>Dada</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Symbolist</ORGANIZATION> art while <PERSON>Sotheby</PERSON>'s is luring collectors with sales of Swiss, German, <LOCATION>Spanish</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australian</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canadian</LOCATION> paintings.
In <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Hotel de Ventes Horta</ORGANIZATION> auctioned pistols and sabers-along with paintings and jewels. 
<LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Villa Grisebach</PERSON> will auction art works with pre-sale estimates of less than $1,600 on Nov. 25.
The auction house, known for its sales of top-drawer 19th and 20th century works, is providing "a service to clients who don't want to sell just their fabulous oil paintings," says <PERSON>Villa Grisebach</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Vivien Reuter</PERSON>. 
<LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION> auctioneer Campo is less concerned with market niches than with <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>'s crushing tax and auction-fee burden. "Everything has to be the same between countries," says <PERSON>Campo</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Stefan Campo</PERSON>, who is asking clients to sign protest petitions. "Then there'll be fair competition." 
Ending tax-free shopping in the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> after 1992 could threaten more than 3,000 jobs, the <ORGANIZATION>International Duty Free Confederation</ORGANIZATION> said.
Instead of banning such shopping, the confederation proposed amending controls to be sure the privilege isn't abused. . . . British and Argentine diplomats opened talks in <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> aimed at restoring ties severed because of their 1982 war over the <LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> representative and delegation head <PERSON>Crispin Tickell</PERSON> called the first meeting "good, interesting and businesslike." 
Hardest hit by <LOCATION>Hugo</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> were small retailers tied to the tourist industry and businesses in agriculture and cultivated seafood.
After <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> weather man <PERSON>Willard Scott</PERSON> broadcast the hot-line number, it was flooded with 10,000 calls.
The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, after deleting Section 89 repeal from its deficit-reduction bill, still is expected to join the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> in voting to kill the law, which forces companies to provide comparable benefits to laborers and executives alike.
And they still oppose as too costly an employer-paid health insurance bill sponsored by <PERSON>Sen. Edward Kennedy</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>) despite his proposal to phase in small business only gradually.
"With the repeal of Section 89, we can no longer say they're discouraging businesses from offering health plans," says <PERSON>Christine Russell</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>'s small-business advocate. 
JUMPING THE GUN: <PERSON>Sen. Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>) was outraged after a private word to <PERSON>John Motley</PERSON>, lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION>National Federation of Independent Business</ORGANIZATION>, resulted in a news release saying that the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Finance Committee</ORGANIZATION> chairman would recommend repeal of Section 89.
PRISON-SHOP BLUES: <PERSON>Sen. Strom Thurmond</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>) protests pending legislation to end the preference that the federal prison system gets in selling prisoner-made furniture and other goods to government agencies.
Groups representing some independent auto-repair shops join a compromise on the <ORGANIZATION>Clean Air</ORGANIZATION> legislation worked out between environmentalists and Rep. <PERSON>Henry Waxman</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>).
Shops represented by the <ORGANIZATION>Automotive Service Industry Association</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association</ORGANIZATION> oppose any increase in warranty length.
<PERSON>Stan Hathcock</PERSON>, an <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> garage owner who opposes a longer warranty, estimates that the current plan costs him as much as $15,000 a year in lost business. 
SMALL TALK: Some 70% of graduates who recently earned an M.B.A. degree say they'd prefer to work in or own a small company, yet most take jobs with large concerns, says a survey by the <ORGANIZATION>Foster McKay Group</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> recruiting firm. . . . <ORGANIZATION>Cardinal Scientific Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Waldorf</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, seeks a <ORGANIZATION>Small Business Innovation Research</ORGANIZATION> grant to produce a "nozzle assembly for an <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> mass delousing outfit." 
<ORGANIZATION>Ways and Means</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Rostenkowski</PERSON> backed a simplification plan in the pending <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> tax bill, but the plan turns out to be a big revenue loser. 
Proponents of simplification fear that the chances of getting it into the final bill are waning. "We hear it has low priority on the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> side," says <PERSON>Samuel Starr</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Coopers & Lybrand</ORGANIZATION>, CPAs.
But <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> still could resolve the issue with other legislation this year or next, <PERSON>Starr</PERSON> adds. 
<ORGANIZATION>THE IRS</ORGANIZATION> DELAYS several deadlines for <LOCATION>Hugo</LOCATION>'s victims. 
<ORGANIZATION>IRS Notice</ORGANIZATION> 89-136 describes this and other deadline relief for <ORGANIZATION>Hugo</ORGANIZATION>'s victims. 
ONE-DAY JAUNTS in a chartered boat were perks for permanent staffers of <ORGANIZATION>American Business Service Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Costa Mesa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, supplier of temporary workers.
People often cite frugality and distrust of banks to justify cash caches to the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Gregory Damonne Brown</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, a hardworking, reclusive young bachelor, told that story to the <ORGANIZATION>Tax Court</ORGANIZATION>.
But judges usually find the real aim is to escape tax on hidden income; and the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> must have had such income -- although it uncovered no source -- because he deposited $124,732 in a bank account in 1982-84 while reporting income of only $52,012. 
<PERSON>Brown</PERSON>'s story: The deposits came from savings kept in a <LOCATION>Tupperware</LOCATION> breadbox; he saved $47,000 in 1974-81 by living with family members and pinching pennies and $45,000 of secret gifts from his remorseful father, who had abandoned the family in 1955.
<PERSON>Brown</PERSON> had no proof; but testimony of his mother and stepmother about his father and of an ex-employer about his honesty and habits satisfied a judge that <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> was truthful and his tale of gifts was possible. 
The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> offered no evidence of hidden sources of taxable income, so <ORGANIZATION>Judge Shields</ORGANIZATION> rejected its claims. 
BRIEFS: Asked how he made charitable gifts of $26,350 out of reported two-year income of $46,892, <PERSON>Thomas H. McFall</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Bryan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION>Tax Court</ORGANIZATION> he had understated his income.
The court rejected his incredible claims, denied his deductions, and imposed a negligence penalty. . . . Rep. <PERSON>Schaefer</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>) entered a bill to exempt from tax rewards for tips leading to the arrest of violent criminals.

Houston-based <ORGANIZATION>Maryland Club Foods</ORGANIZATION>, which had sales of about $200 million last year, sells coffee under the <ORGANIZATION>Maryland Club</ORGANIZATION> and Butter-Nut brands to restaurants, hotels, offices and airlines.
<ORGANIZATION>P&G</ORGANIZATION> already sells its <ORGANIZATION>Folgers</ORGANIZATION> ground roast coffee to food service concerns, but not to as many markets as <ORGANIZATION>Maryland Club</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Maryland Club</ORGANIZATION> also distributes tea, which fits well with <ORGANIZATION>P&G</ORGANIZATION>'s Tender Leaf brand, and hot cocoa products. 
The purchase includes a coffee-roasting plant in <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neb.</LOCATION>, and a leased facility in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>. 
Linear Technology, <LOCATION>Milpitas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, called the settlement "positive," since products covered by the disputed patents account for about 20% of its annual sales. 
The electronics concern said it already has paid $2 million of the settlement to National Semiconductor, <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, and will pay the remaining $1 million in equal installments over the next eight quarters.
These apocalyptic predictions were advanced by such stalwarts as <PERSON>Paul Ehrlich</PERSON>, <PERSON>Barry Commoner</PERSON>, <PERSON>Rene Dubois</PERSON> and <PERSON>George Wald</PERSON>.
Writing in the 1960s <PERSON>Ms. Carson</PERSON> suggested that the human race could be eliminated in 20 years, and <PERSON>Mr. Wald</PERSON> suggested that life on earth might end by 1985.
<LOCATION>Beantown</LOCATION> scribes, who spare no invective when taking on local luminaries such as <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> "Pee Wee" <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>, or <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> Patriots Coach <PERSON>Raymond</PERSON> "Rev.
Ray" <PERSON>Berry</PERSON>, yesterday poured ridicule on new drawings of <ORGANIZATION>Globe</ORGANIZATION> columnists that replaced old photos in the revamped pages this week.
Globe columnist <PERSON>Mike Barnicle</PERSON> -- in the second attack on his employer in as many weeks -- averred that his shadowy countenance was so bad, it looked "like a face you'd find on a bottle of miracle elixir that promises to do away with diarrhea in our lifetime." <PERSON>Mr. Barnicle</PERSON> reminded readers that he still hasn't forgiven Globe management for questioning a $20 expense chit he submitted for parking his car while chasing a story. 
<PERSON>Mr. Barnicle</PERSON> was hardly kinder to the renderings of colleagues <PERSON>Michael Madden</PERSON> ("appears to be a pervert"), <PERSON>Will McDonough</PERSON> ("looks as if he drove for Abe Lincoln") or <PERSON>Bella English</PERSON>, whose "little girl now screams hysterically every time she sees a newspaper." 
<PERSON>Lynn Staley</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Globe</ORGANIZATION>'s assistant managing editor for design, acknowledges that the visages were "on the low end of the likeness spectrum." 
<ORGANIZATION>Rival Boston Herald</ORGANIZATION> columnist <PERSON>Howie Carr</PERSON>, who usually rails at <ORGANIZATION>Statehouse</ORGANIZATION> "hacks" and nepotism, argued that the new drawings were designed to hide <PERSON>Mr. Madden</PERSON>'s "rapidly growing forehead" and the facial defects of "chinless" <PERSON>Dan Shaughnessy</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Globe</ORGANIZATION> sports columnist. 
As for joint ventures, <PERSON>Mr. Houghton</PERSON> said profit was "essentially flat" due primarily to a slow recovery at <ORGANIZATION>Samsung-Corning Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> following a strike at a major customer and the disruption of shipments to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>.
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>Corning</ORGANIZATION> closed at $38.50, down 75 cents. 
"The stock market clearly is leading the bond markets," said <PERSON>Jack Conlon</PERSON>, an executive vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Nikko Securities</ORGANIZATION>. "People are breathing a major sigh of relief that the world didn't end Monday morning" or yesterday. 
<ORGANIZATION>Nikko</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Conlon</PERSON> fears a huge wave of <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> borrowing early next month will drive down <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bond prices.
But several other traders contend investors have overreacted to junk-bond jitters, and that stock prices will continue to recover. "They shot the whole orchestra just because the piano player hit a bad note," said <PERSON>Laszlo Birinyi</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Birinyi Associates Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, referring to the stock market's plunge Friday on news of trouble in financing the <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION> buy-out. 
<PERSON>Michael A. Gaskin</PERSON>, 55 years old, was named president and chief executive officer of this manufacturer of industrial robots, succeeding <PERSON>Walter K. Weisel</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr. Weisel</PERSON>, 49, resigned as president and chief executive and will work on special projects, said <PERSON>John J. Wallace</PERSON>, chairman.
<PERSON>Mr. Gaskin</PERSON> formerly was president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Taylor & Gaskin Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and was a director of <ORGANIZATION>Prab Robots</ORGANIZATION> since 1985.

<ORGANIZATION>J.P. Morgan & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, will help the statutory managers of <ORGANIZATION>DFC New Zealand Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> to evaluate the failed investment bank's condition. 
Earlier this month, the <ORGANIZATION>Reserve Bank</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>, the country's central bank, appointed the managers to run the investment bank and pay creditors.
<ORGANIZATION>DFC</ORGANIZATION> is held 80% by National Provident Fund, <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>'s largest pension fund, and 20% by <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the investment-bank and securities-firm subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
A spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION>J.P. Morgan</ORGANIZATION>, parent of the bank <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION>, confirmed its appointment to assist the managers but declined to elaborate. 
The managers said in a brief statement yesterday that <ORGANIZATION>Morgan</ORGANIZATION> will help evaluate <ORGANIZATION>DFC</ORGANIZATION>'s position and help determine alternatives.
At the recent meetings of the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration announced its intention to decide by yearend the size of the next increase in the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION>'s capital base.
While the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> share of the increase probably will not reach the $12 billion or more implicit in the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION>'s request for a doubling of its $90 billion capital, the administration probably will agree to a multibillion-dollar increase.
This would be consistent with its unwavering support for the Brady Plan and <ORGANIZATION>G-7</ORGANIZATION> exchange-rate intervention, and with its financial commitment to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> and others. 
Second, the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s recent $75 billion capital increase -- $14 billion from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> -- has left the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> feeling less than first fiddle among international financial institutions.
Third, the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> would like to meet <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s request for increased ownership (currently 4.5%).
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> has supported a larger role for the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> in developing-country debt issues, and is an important financial resource for IMF-guided programs in developing countries. 
They worry that new <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> funding of developing countries will simply end up substituting <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> debt for reschedulable commercial bank debt, a bad trade all around.
They believe microeconomics, which addresses the problems of markets, investment climate and management practices, is the key to developing-country growth, not the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Keynesian</LOCATION> focus on trade deficits, quarterly targets and government debt.
Decisions on increases in the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION>'s capital base traditionally are made by the administration, with subsequent authorization by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
A <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> decision to refuse the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> its capital increase, or limit it to 25%, would bring a major change in international economic policy, and could not be taken lightly.
Furthermore, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> rejection of the capital increase (and transfer of shares to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>) would give <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> an argument against future calls for economic burden-sharing. 
<PERSON>Mr. Malpass</PERSON> directs the Republican staff of the <ORGANIZATION>Joint Economic Committee of Congress</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Thomas E. Meador</PERSON>, 42 years old, was named president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION>Balcor Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Skokie</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, subsidiary of this <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investment banking firm.

"Banks want to remain competitive," said <PERSON>Norberto Mehl</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Banxquote</ORGANIZATION>. "October is a big rollover month and perhaps they anticipate greater demand . . . among people leaving the stock market." 
Some bankers are reporting more inquiries than usual about CDs since Friday. "Reports from branches are that there has been greater interest in the last day or so," said <PERSON>Steven Braitman</PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Chemical Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
"This is no time to be playing in the street . . . the Dow has more ups and downs than an elevator," proclaimed an advertisement Monday in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> newspapers, touting <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln Savings Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s one-year CD. <PERSON>Harold Jones</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s chief retail banking officer, said there hasn't yet been "a discernible response," although the ad included a coupon that could arrive later in the week. 
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION>, for instance, increased the yield on small-denomination three-month CDs to 8% from 7.9%.
CD yields are generally expected to fall further in coming weeks. "What happened in the stock market and the bigger trade deficit" reported yesterday "make it unlikely that short-term interest rates will rise" any time soon, said <PERSON>Mr. Mehl</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Banxquote</ORGANIZATION>. 
"Even before the market drop, rates were down about half a percentage point," said <PERSON>Robert J. Hutchinson</PERSON>, senior vice president for retail marketing at <ORGANIZATION>Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. "That puts pressure on CD rates." 
<PERSON>Dr. Wyndham Wilson</PERSON>, a cancer treatment specialist at the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION>, said the test is widely used in research centers but isn't having a major impact because it is only occasionally useful in choosing the most effective treatment.
That's the view of some analysts here who argue that <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s leading maker of luxury cars still may have two <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auto giants battling for it. 
Yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor</ORGANIZATION> disclosed that it has raised its holding in <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> to 10.4% from 5%.
Both <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> and its rival <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> recently set their sights on grabbing significant minority stakes in the British company. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s latest move increases the pressure on <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> to complete its current talks with <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> quickly.
The curbs prevent a buyer from purchasing more than 15% of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shares without permission. "This is an exceptionally odd takeover battle," says <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> analyst <ORGANIZATION>Christopher Will of Shearson Lehman Hutton</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s American depositary receipts were up 3/8 yesterday in a down market, closing at 10 3/8. (<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s ADRs make the company one of the most widely held <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> stocks in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, with more than one-fourth of its shares owned there.) 
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> topped the most-active list for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> over-the-counter market Monday.
Fears that <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s ardor might be cooling put <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shares into reverse after <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> confirmed its friendly negotiations with <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>.
Both <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Will</PERSON> and <PERSON>Stephen Reitman</PERSON>, European auto analyst at the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> brokerage firm <ORGANIZATION>UBS-Phillips & Drew</ORGANIZATION>, recently switched their <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> recommendations to hold from buy. "Sit tight" through the coming volatility, <PERSON>Mr. Reitman</PERSON> suggests, though he concedes that many small investors will find <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s zigzags "too hard to swallow." 
But a crucial point is how <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> reacts when <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest auto maker, firms up its proposed deal with <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>.
At the moment, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> executives will say little beyond reiterating their desire to raise <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> stake to about 15%. 
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> is expected to inject roughly #200 million ($316 million) by acquiring some <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shares, and then win <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> management's promise of an eventual 30% stake.
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> might challenge the proposal by offering a full bid if holders and the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> government agreed to drop the anti-takeover barrier early. "I think <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> is going to come out with full guns blazing," <PERSON>Mr. Reitman</PERSON> says. "<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> wants {<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>} very much." <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> takeover-stock speculators, who may own between 20% and 30% of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, could give <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> enough votes to block the <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> deal. 
Then, <PERSON>Mr. Will</PERSON> says, "you get a bidding war between two very rich, very determined international companies." He believes <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s share price could zoom to between #8 and #10 ($12.60 to $15.80). 
"There's quite a bit of value left in the {<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>} shares here even though they have run up" lately, says <PERSON>Doug Johnson</PERSON>, a fund manager for Seattle-based <ORGANIZATION>Safeco Asset Management</ORGANIZATION>.
The risk is that <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s share price could slump if <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> effectively locks out its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> rival. "<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s appetite to attack {<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>} could gradually wane over time, particularly if <PERSON>Saab</PERSON> is a reasonably attractive proposition," says <PERSON>John Lawson</PERSON>, an auto analyst at <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Nomura Research Institute</ORGANIZATION>.
He thinks <ORGANIZATION>Saab-Scania AB</ORGANIZATION> on Friday will announce the sale of 50% of its car division to <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>; the companies have been discussing closer cooperation for months. 
<PERSON>Clifford Stahl</PERSON>, president and chief investment officer of <ORGANIZATION>C-S Capital Advisors Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, two weeks ago sold his <ORGANIZATION>Cincinnati</ORGANIZATION> firm's 107,100 <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> ADRs at about 10 each, making a tidy profit on a holding purchased at 4 7/8 in early May. "I thought the probabilities of {a bidding war} happening were less," he says.
<ORGANIZATION>BroadBeach Associates Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> investment partnership whose $62-a-share bid for <ORGANIZATION>McGill Manufacturing Co.</ORGANIZATION> was topped recently by a competing offer from a Swedish concern, disclosed that it sold its entire 7% McGill stake. 
<PERSON>McGill</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Valparaiso</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION>, ball-bearing manufacturer, had rebuffed BroadBeach's proposal.
It has since asked holders not to immediately tender their shares under a recent $72-a-share, or $104 million, bid from <ORGANIZATION>AB SKF</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, until <ORGANIZATION>McGill</ORGANIZATION> directors have completed their evaluation. 
In a <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> filing, <ORGANIZATION>BroadBeach</ORGANIZATION> said it sold the 101,000 <ORGANIZATION>McGill</ORGANIZATION> shares for $7.3 million in a private transaction on Oct. 12.
<ORGANIZATION>BroadBeach</ORGANIZATION> didn't identify the buyer of the shares, but the date of the selloff followed by one day the Swedish concern's tender offer, and the indicated price of the shares sold equals <ORGANIZATION>SKF</ORGANIZATION>'s $72-a-share tender offer price. 
<PERSON>Mr. Tanner</PERSON> had been president of <ORGANIZATION>Penn Pacific's National Southwest Capital Group</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary.
<PERSON>Mr. Boudreau</PERSON> will remain with <ORGANIZATION>Penn Pacific</ORGANIZATION> as a director and a member of the executive committee.
Rep. <PERSON>Lee Hamilton</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION>) said he and Rep. <PERSON>Byron Dorgan</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>N.D.</LOCATION>) are backing away from their proposal to make the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Secretary a voting member of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> panel that sets monetary policy. 
Rep. <PERSON>Hamilton</PERSON> said the bill will be modified substantially to call for two meetings each year between the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>'s open market committee and the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Secretary, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Council of Economic Advisers</ORGANIZATION> and the director of the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Management and Budget</ORGANIZATION>. 
The original bill was strongly opposed by the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> and publicly criticized by friends of the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> as an attempt to undermine the central bank's independence.
Rep. <PERSON>Hamilton</PERSON> said the purpose of the meetings would be to "improve communications and perhaps coordination between the executive branch and the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>." 
<ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Alan Greenspan</PERSON> meets regularly for lunch with <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Nicholas Brady</PERSON> and talks frequently with Budget Director <PERSON>Richard Darman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michael Boskin</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Council of Economic Advisers</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Banc One Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Frank E. McKinney</PERSON> plans to retire as the bank holding company's president effective Jan. 12. 
Banc One said "it is contemplated" that <PERSON>John B. McCoy</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, will assume the additional position of president upon <PERSON>Mr. McKinney</PERSON>'s retirement. 
<PERSON>Mr. McKinney</PERSON>, 50 years old, was chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>American Fletcher Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION>, when that bank holding company merged into <ORGANIZATION>Banc One</ORGANIZATION> in January 1987.
The company said <PERSON>Mr. McKinney</PERSON> plans to retire because the process of affiliating American <PERSON>Fletcher</PERSON> into Banc One "is considered completed." 
<PERSON>Mr. McKinney</PERSON> will continue as chairman of the board and chairman of the executive committee of <ORGANIZATION>Banc One Indiana Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the successor company to <ORGANIZATION>American Fletcher Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, but will no longer be active in day-to-day management.
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> will veto a bill funding the <ORGANIZATION>Departments of Labor</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Education and Health and Human Services</ORGANIZATION> because it would allow federal funding of abortions for victims of rape and incest, the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> said. 
White House Press Secretary <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON> said negotiations between <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> aides and lawmakers ended Monday without success.
<ORGANIZATION>Newport Electronics Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Milton B. Hollander</PERSON>, who holds a 49.4% stake, requested a special shareholders' meeting next Wednesday to remove four current directors and elect an alternative slate. 
<PERSON>Mr. Hollander</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>High Technology Holding Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Stamford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, acquired most of its stake last August in an $11-a-share tender offer for <ORGANIZATION>Newport</ORGANIZATION>, a maker of electronic-measuring devices. 
<ORGANIZATION>Newport</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Mr. Hollander</PERSON> is asking shareholders to retain only one director, <PERSON>James R. Lees</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Newport</ORGANIZATION> vice president.
<PERSON>Mr. Hollander</PERSON> "is the new owner and wants to exercise control," said <PERSON>Barret B. Weekes</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Newport</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman.

Prime Minister <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON> set a date next month for general elections that some analysts say could cost him and his ruling <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> (I) Party control of the government. 
Much depends on the opposition, a loose group of regional and ideological parties led by former <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> cabinet minister <PERSON>Vishwanath Pratap Singh</PERSON>. 
Yesterday, four days after an unusual parliamentary defeat for the ruling party, <PERSON>Mr. Gandhi</PERSON> called elections for the lower house of <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 22 and 24.
The elections will be a rigorous test for the 45-year-old prime minister and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> (I), which in various forms has ruled for 40 of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s 42 years of independence.
After a landslide win in 1984 in polls held after the assassination of his mother, <PERSON>Indira Gandhi</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Gandhi</PERSON> saw his popularity begin a roller coaster ride. 
Some analysts predict that disappointment in <PERSON>Mr. Gandhi</PERSON>'s spent pledge to reduce corruption and heavy-handed local government will crest at the polls. "There's a wide feeling of indignation across the country," says <PERSON>Bhabani Sen Gupta</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Policy Research</ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>. "I think the people will be judging the regime by a petty policeman, by a corrupt revenue collector.
Even if the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> (I) retains control of the government, <PERSON>Mr. Gandhi</PERSON>'s ability to push through major initiatives might be hobbled by a thinner majority.
The <PERSON>Lok Sabha</PERSON>, or lower house of <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>, has 542 elected and two appointed seats.
In 1984, the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> (I) captured 405 seats, the largest victory in the history of <LOCATION>Indian</LOCATION> democracy.
In 1971, the <ORGANIZATION>Congress Party</ORGANIZATION> won after <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s victory in the <LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION> war.
Most political analysts say that if <PERSON>Mr. Gandhi</PERSON>'s opposition unites to field single candidates in most precincts, the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> (I) will lose big.
<PERSON>Chimanbhai Mehta</PERSON>, a parliamentarian and former <LOCATION>Gandhi</LOCATION> ally, predicts <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> (I) will win only 150 seats, a quarter of the house, if the opposition fields single candidates in 80% of the races.
In 1986, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> signed a $1.4 billion contract with <ORGANIZATION>AB Bofors</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Industries Sweden AB</ORGANIZATION>, to purchase 400 artillery pieces.
"We don't like the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> (I)," says <PERSON>Sooraji Jath</PERSON>, a farmer in the western state of <LOCATION>Gujarat</LOCATION>. "The <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> government is taking the farmers' bread and not giving us any support.
The greatest thing going for <PERSON>Mr. Gandhi</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> (I) Party is the poor reputation of the opposition.
When the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> (I) lost the 1977 election, following <PERSON>Mrs. Gandhi</PERSON>'s hated emergency rule, a similar coalition took power and then disintegrated.
March 24, 1986: <ORGANIZATION>AB Bofors</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Industries Sweden AB</ORGANIZATION>, enters into a $1.4 billion contract with <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Defense Ministry</ORGANIZATION> to supply 400 <ORGANIZATION>Bofors FH-77B</ORGANIZATION> 155-mm field howitzer guns.
In 1985, Prime Minister <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON>, in his talks with then Swedish Prime Minister <PERSON>Olof Palme</PERSON>, imposed the condition that the contract have no middlemen. 
April 16, 1987: <ORGANIZATION>Swedish National Radio</ORGANIZATION> reports that about $40 million -- nearly 3% of the total contract -- was paid by <PERSON>Bofors</PERSON> as commissions to middlemen. 
June 1, 1987: <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Audit Bureau</ORGANIZATION> releases its report confirming payment of about $40 million to unidentified Indians.
Aug. 6, 1987: Prime Minister <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> tells the <ORGANIZATION>Indian Parliament</ORGANIZATION>, ". . . neither I nor any member of my family has received any consideration in these transactions.
April 22, 1988: The <ORGANIZATION>Hindu</ORGANIZATION> newspaper publishes facsimiles of bank documents for foreign-exchange remittances and letters between <ORGANIZATION>Bofors</ORGANIZATION> and certain private companies related to the sale of the guns to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. 
April 26, 1988: A parliamentary investigative committee dominated by the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> (I) Party concludes that there were no middlemen in the deal and no payment to any <LOCATION>Indian</LOCATION> individual or company. 
July 18, 1989: The comptroller and auditor-general of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> reports serious lapses in the government's technical and financial evaluation of the <ORGANIZATION>Bofors</ORGANIZATION> deal. 
Oct. 9. 1989: The <ORGANIZATION>Hindu</ORGANIZATION> newspaper publishes the withheld portion of the <ORGANIZATION>Swedish National Audit Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s report.
The disclosures state that commissions were paid by <PERSON>Bofors</PERSON> to an <LOCATION>Indian</LOCATION> agent of the arms company. 
<PERSON>Mr. Ittleson</PERSON> is executive, special projects, at <ORGANIZATION>CIT Group Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which is controlled by <ORGANIZATION>Manufacturers Hanover Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
But directors of the <LOCATION>Great Neck</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, real estate investment trust didn't act on the common stock dividend.
Deeply ingrained in both the book review "Kissing Nature Good-bye" by <PERSON>Stephen MacDonald</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Leisure & Arts</ORGANIZATION>, Sept. 27) and the books reviewed is the assumption that global warming is entirely a result of human activity.
Enormous ice sheets retreated from the face of <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>.
Get the problem behind you and don't look back," said <PERSON>James J. McDermott</PERSON>, analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Keefe, Bruyette & Woods</ORGANIZATION>, in approving of the move.
<ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> yesterday reported a 9% third-quarter earnings drop, which analysts called a bit disappointing, while <ORGANIZATION>Manufacturers Hanover Corp.</ORGANIZATION> posted a $789 million loss for the quarter after adding $950 million to its reserve for loans to less-developed countries. 
<ORGANIZATION>Wells Fargo & Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> posted a 17% jump.
<ORGANIZATION>PNC Financial Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION>Pittsburgh National Bank</ORGANIZATION>, reported net income climbed 9.8%, while net for <ORGANIZATION>Banc One Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, grew 3.8%. 
Analysts were only slightly disappointed by <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>'s numbers. "There's nothing in here that's horrible and nothing to make you think they're setting the world on fire," said <PERSON>Carole Berger</PERSON>, analyst for <ORGANIZATION>C.J. Lawrence</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Grenfell Inc</ORGANIZATION>. Earnings from the bank's global consumer business grew 27%. "The consumer business continues to drive the earnings stream," said <PERSON>Mr. McDermott</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Keefe</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Bruyette & Woods</ORGANIZATION>. 
The cross-border loan portfolio reflected "adjustment problems and episodic payment patterns," the bank said no interest payments from <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> in the nine months and none from <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> in the third quarter, while <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> brought itself "substantially current." Overall, the portfolio narrowed its quarterly loss to $70 million from $80 million a year earlier. 
<PERSON>Ronald I. Mandle</PERSON>, analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, called <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>'s venture-capital gains of $93 million before taxes "strong." A "concerning" item the analyst cited was the 10% jump in expenses, which the bank attributes to costs of expanding both its consumer credit-card operations and its overseas branch business.
The combination of solid loan growth with tight expense control gave <PERSON>Wells Fargo</PERSON> a 1.25% return on average assets for the quarter, about 40% higher than <ORGANIZATION>Security Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s and a profit ratio matched by only two or three other major banks in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <PERSON>Wells Fargo</PERSON>'s return on equity increased to 24.4% from 23.8%. 
That trend, and <PERSON>Wells Fargo</PERSON>'s heavy exposure to leveraged buy-outs, are about the only worries analysts have about <PERSON>Wells Fargo</PERSON>'s financial picture.
The <LOCATION>Redmond</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION> company, a bellwether provider of operating systems and software for personal-computer makers and users, reported net income for the quarter ended Sept. 30 of $49.6 million, or 87 cents a share, up from $36.6 million, or 65 cents a share, in the year-ago period.
But the nations of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> have decided they know better.
At this week's <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> conference in <LOCATION>Lausanne</LOCATION>, they imposed a global ivory ban that seeks to overturn local policies. 
Many delegates were willing to craft a compromise, but <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> delegate <PERSON>Constance Harriman</PERSON> and others thundered that down.
The director of <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Department</ORGANIZATION> described <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> conservationists as "fat little puppies from urban environments who don't know a thing about <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>." That's not fair; they're not all fat. 
"Capital spending and exports, which have been the driving force in this expansion, are showing clear signs of having the steam taken out of them," said <PERSON>Robert Dederick</PERSON>, economist for <ORGANIZATION>Northern Trust Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. 
The new reports of sluggishness, which were foreshadowed by an earlier <ORGANIZATION>Labor Department</ORGANIZATION> report that manufacturing payrolls dropped by 105,000 in September, give the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> another reason to further ease its grip on credit and lower interest rates. "They need to do something about this," said <PERSON>Maury Harris</PERSON>, economist at <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Group Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> also said <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> industry operated at 83.6% of capacity last month, down from 83.8% in August. 
Look at what happened to <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, <PERSON>Stephen M. Wolf</PERSON>, and its chief financial officer, <PERSON>John C. Pope</PERSON>. 
On a day some <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION> employees wanted <PERSON>Mr. Wolf</PERSON> fired and takeover stock speculators wanted his scalp, Messrs.
<PERSON>Wolf</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> saw their prospective personal fortunes continue to plummet as shares of <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, dived $24.875 on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION> to close at $198. 
<PERSON>Mr. Wolf</PERSON> owns 75,000 <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> shares and has options to buy another 250,000 at $83.3125 each.
He left his last two jobs at <ORGANIZATION>Republic Airlines</ORGANIZATION> and Flying Tiger with combined stock-option gains of about $22 million, and <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> gave him a $15 million bonus when it hired him.
<ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> paid him a $375,000 bonus to lure him away from <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, and he was paid a salary of $342,122 last year with a $280,000 bonus. 
<PERSON>Mr. Pope</PERSON> owns 10,000 <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION> shares and has options to buy another 150,000 at $69 each.
When Maj. <PERSON>Moises Giroldi</PERSON>, the leader of the abortive coup in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, was buried, his body bore several gunshot wounds, a cracked skull and broken legs and ribs.
They were the signature of his adversary, <LOCATION>Panamanian</LOCATION> leader <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON>. 
The rebel officer's slow and painful death, at the headquarters of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s Battalion-2000 squad, was personally supervised by Gen. <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, says a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official with access to intelligence reports.
Leaping into rages, sinking into bouts of drunkenness and mistrust, <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> has put to death some 70 of his troops involved in the coup, according to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials monitoring crematoriums and funeral parlors in <LOCATION>Panama City</LOCATION>. 
His meals are most often prepared by women he trusts -- his full-time mistress, <PERSON>Vicky Amado</PERSON>, and her mother, <LOCATION>Norma</LOCATION>.
In the two weeks since the rebellion, which the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> hesitantly backed, <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> has been at his most brutal-and efficient-in maintaining power.
Yet, while the failed coup is a major <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> foreign policy embarrassment, it is merely the latest chapter in a byzantine relationship between <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> that stretches back three decades.
Before American foreign policy set out to destroy <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, it helped create him out of the crucible of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s long history of conspirators and pirates. 
In 1960, for example, when <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> was both a cadet at an elite military academy in <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> and a spy-in-training for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency</ORGANIZATION>, he was detained by <LOCATION>Lima</LOCATION> authorities for allegedly raping and savagely beating a prostitute, according to a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> cable from that period.
<PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON>'s tips on emerging leftists at his school were deemed more important to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> interests.
The 55-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> isn't as smooth as the shah of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, as well-born as <ORGANIZATION>Nicaragua</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Anastasio Somoza</PERSON>, as imperial as <PERSON>Ferdinand Marcos</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> or as bloody as <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s Baby <PERSON>Doc Duvalier</PERSON>.
"The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> underestimated <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> all along," says <PERSON>Ambler Moss</PERSON>, a former Ambassador to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>. "He has mastered the art of survival." 
In keeping with <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s long history of propping up <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON>, recent <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> actions have extended rather than shortened his survival.
<PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> might have fallen of his own weight in 1988 because of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s dire economic situation, says <PERSON>Mr. Moss</PERSON>, but increasing external pressure has only given him additional excuses for repression, and a scapegoat for his own mismanagement. 
"If the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> had sat back and done nothing, he might not have made it through 1988," <PERSON>Mr. Moss</PERSON> contends. 
One Colombian drug boss, upon hearing in 1987 that Gen. <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> was negotiating with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> to abandon his command for a comfortable exile, sent him a hand-sized mahogany coffin engraved with his name. 
"He is cornered," says the Rev. <PERSON>Fernando Guardia</PERSON>, who has led <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> opposition against <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>. "The Americans have left him without a way out.
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> discovered the young <PERSON>Tony Noriega</PERSON> in late 1959, when he was in his second year at the <ORGANIZATION>Chorrillos Military Academy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Lima</LOCATION>, according to former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> intelligence officials.
The contact occurred through <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON>'s half-brother, a <LOCATION>Panamanian</LOCATION> diplomat based in <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> named <PERSON>Luis Carlos Noriega Hurtado</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Luis Carlos</PERSON>, knowing that helping the Americans could advance the career of any Panamanian officer, relayed <PERSON>Tony</PERSON>'s reports on the leftist tendencies he observed among his fellow students and, more important, among his officers and instructors.
It was a heady experience for the pockmarked and slightly built <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON>, who was known to his friends as <ORGANIZATION>Cara</ORGANIZATION> la <LOCATION>Pina</LOCATION> -- pineapple face.
In his peaked military cap and neatly pressed, French-made uniform, <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> felt more respected and powerful than ever in his underprivileged life, friends from the period say. "He had an elegant uniform with gold buttons in a country where there was a cult of militarism, where officers were the elite with special privileges," recalls <PERSON>Darien Ayala</PERSON>, a fellow student in <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> and a lifelong friend. 
His commanding officer at the <ORGANIZATION>Chiriqui Province</ORGANIZATION> garrison, Major <PERSON>Omar Torrijos</PERSON>, gave him an intriguing assignment: <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> would organize the province's first intelligence service. 
The spy network would serve two clients: the Panamanian government, by monitoring political opponents in the region, and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, by tracking the growing Communist influence in the unions organized at <ORGANIZATION>United Fruit Co.</ORGANIZATION> 's banana plantations in <LOCATION>Bocas</LOCATION> del <LOCATION>Toros</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Puerto Armuelles</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>United Fruit</ORGANIZATION> was one of the two largest contributors to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s national income.
<PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON>'s initial retainer was only $50 to $100 a month, plus occasional gifts of liquor or groceries from the <ORGANIZATION>American PX</ORGANIZATION>, a former intelligence official says.
"He did it very well," recalls <PERSON>Boris Martinez</PERSON>, a former Panamanian colonel who managed <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> and his operation. "He started building the files that helped him gain power." 
A <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> job assumed by Capt. <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> in 1964 -- as chief of the transit police in <LOCATION>David City</LOCATION>, capital of the <LOCATION>Chiriqui Province</LOCATION> -- was tailor-made for an aspiring super-spy.
So he splashed the information on handbills that he distributed throughout the banana-exporting city of <LOCATION>Puerto Armuelles</LOCATION>, which was ruled by <ORGANIZATION>United Fruit Co</ORGANIZATION>.
"It was like a play on Broadway," recalls <PERSON>Mr. Martinez</PERSON>. "<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> managed the whole thing.
During his years in <LOCATION>Chiriqui</LOCATION>, however, <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> also revealed himself as an officer as perverse as he was ingenious.
<PERSON>Rodrigo Miranda</PERSON>, a local lawyer and human-rights monitor, recalls an intoxicated <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> visiting prisoners in their cells at the 5th Zone Garrison headquarters in <PERSON>David</PERSON>, where he had his offices.
<PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the courtyard naked, laughing at them and then retreating to his office. "People started wondering if something was wrong with him," <PERSON>Mr. Miranda</PERSON> recalls. 
But through this period, so far as the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military was concerned, <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> was a model recruit.
He signed up for intelligence and counter-intelligence training under American officers at <ORGANIZATION>Fort Gulick</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> in July 1967, according to a copy of a 1983 resume with details <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> has since classified as secret.
He flew to <LOCATION>Fort Bragg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, in September of that year for a course in psychological operations, returning to the School of the <LOCATION>Americas</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> for a two-month course called "military intelligence for officers." 
He became Gen. <PERSON>Torrijos</PERSON>'s inseparable shadow, and the holder of all <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s secrets.
When <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> diplomats complained to the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> of Col. <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s moonlighting, intelligence experts always insisted that his allegiance was first to the Americans. 
"Early on in the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION>, we took to calling him the rent-a-colonel, in tribute to his ability to simultaneously milk the antagonistic intelligence services of <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>," recalls <PERSON>Francis J. McNeil</PERSON>, who, as deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, first ran across reports about <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> in 1977. "Some of us wondered how our intelligence people could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the Cubans." 
During the <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> administration, the <ORGANIZATION>Drug Enforcement Administration</ORGANIZATION> became dismayed at the extent of the G-2's connections to arrested drug traffickers.
The head of the <ORGANIZATION>DEA</ORGANIZATION> at the time, <PERSON>John Ingersoll</PERSON>, scotched the assassination plan.
But he did fly to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> to scold dictator Torrijos on the drug ties of Panamanian officials, including <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr. Ingersoll</PERSON> later recalled that Gen. <PERSON>Torrijos</PERSON> seemed afraid to act on the concerns of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> "Everybody was afraid of him," <PERSON>Mr. Ingersoll</PERSON> says. 
<PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> became an even greater threat in 1976, when <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> intelligence services discovered that he had been buying recordings of electronically monitored conversations from three sergeants working for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>470th Military Intelligence Group</ORGANIZATION>.
The tapes included wiretaps of Gen. <PERSON>Torrijos</PERSON>'s own phone, according to <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> intelligence officials. 
"We caught him with his hands on our cookie jar," says former <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>Stansfield Turner</PERSON>. 
For the first time, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> considered cutting <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> from its intelligence payroll -- and the deliberations were intense, <PERSON>Mr. Turner</PERSON> says. "In the world of intelligence, if you want to get information, you get it from seedy characters.
<PERSON>Mr. Turner</PERSON> was troubled enough to cancel the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> contract with the rent-a-colonel at the beginning of the <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> administration. 
Prosecutors in <LOCATION>Southern Florida</LOCATION> indicted five <LOCATION>Panamanians</LOCATION> on charges of illegally running arms to Sandinista rebels trying to overthrow the Nicaraguan government of <PERSON>Mr. Somoza</PERSON>.
They included one of <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON>'s closest friends and business partners, <PERSON>Carlos Wittgreen</PERSON>.
At the time, though, in 1979, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> was once again flirting with its longtime <LOCATION>Latin American</LOCATION> spy.
<PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> made plans to fly to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> for a meeting with his counterpart at the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION>.
<LOCATION>Dade County</LOCATION> and federal authorities, learning that he intended to fly through <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> soil.
According to military officers at the time, word was passed to <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> by his <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> hosts that the police would be waiting.
On Monday, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials received a routine, unclassified message from the military group commander in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>. "Due to health reasons, Lt. Col. <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> has elected to postpone his visit to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>," it read. 
Their original indictment against <PERSON>Mr. Wittgreen</PERSON>, the friend of <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON>, and the other four was dismissed on a technicality.
But now, along with reindicting <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON>'s pal, they intended to charge <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> himself, on allegations that he was involved in the illegal trading of some $2 million in arms. 
In January 1980, <PERSON>Jerome Sanford</PERSON>, as assistant <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney, was summoned to a meeting with a <ORGANIZATION>Federal Bureau of Investigation</ORGANIZATION> agent assigned to the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>.
Panamanian dictator <PERSON>Torrijos</PERSON>, he was told, had granted the shah of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> asylum in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> as a favor to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Sanford</PERSON> was told <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON>'s friend, <PERSON>Mr. Wittgreen</PERSON>, would be handling the shah's security.
After prodding from <PERSON>Mr. Sanford</PERSON>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON>Jack Eskenazi</PERSON> pleaded with <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to let the indictment proceed. "Unfortunately," <PERSON>Mr. Eskenazi</PERSON> wrote in a letter, "those of us in law enforcement in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> find ourselves frequently attempting to enforce the laws of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> but simultaneously being caught between foreign policy considerations over which we have no control." The letter, along with a detailed prosecution memo, sat on the desks of <ORGANIZATION>Justice</ORGANIZATION> officials for months before the case died a quiet death. 
In August 1983, <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> took over as General and de-facto dictator of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, having maneuvered his way to the top only two years after the mysterious death in a plane crash of his old boss <PERSON>Omar Torrijos</PERSON>.
The <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration also put <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON>'s G-2 back on the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> payroll.
Payments averaged nearly $200,000 a year from the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION>. 
Although working for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> intelligence, <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> was hardly helping the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> exclusively.
During the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the Cubans and the <LOCATION>Sandinistas</LOCATION>.
He allegedly entered into <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s first formal business arrangement with Colombian drug bosses, according to <PERSON>Floyd Carlton</PERSON>, a pilot who once worked for <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> and who testified before the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> grand jury in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> that would ultimately indict the Panamanian on drug charges. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> was convinced the <ORGANIZATION>Reagan White House</ORGANIZATION> wouldn't act against him, recalls his close ally <PERSON>Jose Blandon</PERSON>, because he had an insurance policy: his involvement with the <ORGANIZATION>Contra</ORGANIZATION> rebels in <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Blandon</PERSON> says the general allowed the Contras to set up a secret training center in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> also conveyed intelligence from his spy operation inside the Nicaraguan capital of <LOCATION>Managua</LOCATION>.
Although, his help for the <ORGANIZATION>Contra</ORGANIZATION> cause was limited, it was enough to win him important protectors in the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration, says <PERSON>Sen. Patrick Leahy</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> Democrat who then served on the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Intelligence Committee</ORGANIZATION>. "<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> played <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> intelligence agencies and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government like a violin," he says. 
An incident in 1984 suggested one additional means by which <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> might have maintained such influence with <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> -- by compromising <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials.
<PERSON>Curtin Windsor</PERSON>, then the ambassador to <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>, recalls being invited to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> by <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON>'s brother <PERSON>Luis Carlos</PERSON> for a weekend of deep sea fishing and "quiet, serious conversation" on the <LOCATION>Aswara Peninsula</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Windsor</PERSON> notified <PERSON>Everett E. Briggs</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, of the invitation. "Briggs screamed," <PERSON>Mr. Windsor</PERSON> recalls.
He says <PERSON>Mr. Briggs</PERSON> told him he was being set up for a "honey trap," in which <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> would try to involve him in an orgy and then record the event "with sound and video." <PERSON>Mr. Briggs</PERSON>, on vacation after resigning his position at the <ORGANIZATION>National Security Council</ORGANIZATION>, couldn't be reached for comment. 
As <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON>'s political troubles grew, so did his offers of assistance to the Contras, an apparent attempt to curry more favor in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
But just one month later, he also contributed $100,000 to a <LOCATION>Contra</LOCATION> leader, according to documents released for <PERSON>Oliver North</PERSON>'s criminal trial in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> 
<PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> was accused of ordering in 1985 the beheading of <PERSON>Hugo Spadafora</PERSON>, his most outspoken political opponent and the first man to publicly finger <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> on drug trafficking charges.
He then ousted President <PERSON>Nicholas Ardito Barletta</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> official with close ties to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, after <PERSON>Mr. Barletta</PERSON> tried to create a commission to investigate the murder.
As recounted in a stipulation that summarized government documents released for the North trial, <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> offered to assassinate the <LOCATION>Sandinista</LOCATION> leadership in exchange "for a promise to help clean up <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s image and a commitment to lift the {<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>} ban on military sales to the <LOCATION>Panamanian</LOCATION> Defense Forces." 
"North," the document went on, referring to <PERSON>Oliver North</PERSON>, "has told <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s representative that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> law forbade such actions.
The representative responded that <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> had numerous assets in place in <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> and could accomplish many essential things, just as <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> had helped {the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>} the previous year in blowing up a <LOCATION>Sandinista</LOCATION> arsenal." 
Col. <PERSON>North</PERSON> conveyed the request to his superiors and to Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON>Elliot Abrams</PERSON>, who relayed it to Secretary of State <PERSON>George Shultz</PERSON>.
And <PERSON>Mr. Shultz</PERSON> curtly told <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> that the general should be told that only he could repair his tarnished image. 
Within weeks the unfolding <ORGANIZATION>Iran-Contra</ORGANIZATION> scandal took away <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON>'s insurance policy.
The death of <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>William Casey</PERSON> and resignation of <PERSON>Oliver North</PERSON> allowed anti-Noriega political forces to gain influence.
Public protests against him were triggered in June 1987 due to charges by <PERSON>Diaz Herrera</PERSON>, his former chief of staff, that <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> had stolen the 1984 election and had ordered the killing of Messrs.
<LOCATION>Spadafora</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Torrijos</ORGANIZATION>.
During negotiations with <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> officials in May 1988 over proposals to drop the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> indictments in exchange for his resignation, <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> often asked almost plaintively how the Americans, whom he had helped for so many years, could turn against him. 
Now, neither side -- the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> nor <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> -- has an easy out.
In the end, is <PERSON>Mr. Noriega</PERSON> the political equivalent of <LOCATION>Frankenstein</LOCATION>'s monster, created by a well-intentioned but misguided foreign power?
<ORGANIZATION>Boeing Co.</ORGANIZATION>, already struck by its <ORGANIZATION>Machinists</ORGANIZATION> union, briefly called off contract talks with its engineers and labeled their demands "grossly excessive." 
<PERSON>Robert J. Regal</PERSON> was named president and chief executive officer of this company's <ORGANIZATION>Universal-Rundle Corp.</ORGANIZATION> unit.
<PERSON>Mr. Regal</PERSON> had been president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>RBS Industries Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Robert H. Carlson</PERSON>, previous president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Universal-Rundle</ORGANIZATION>, will assume the title of chairman of the unit, a vitreous-china maker. 
We're sorry to report that on Monday President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> accepted the resignation of <PERSON>William Allen</PERSON> as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Civil Rights Commission</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr. Allen</PERSON>, appointed by President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>, grew understandably tired of dealing with the guerrilla tactics of his enemies. 
<PERSON>Mr. Allen</PERSON>'s commissioners voted to call his unread speech "thoughtless, disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory." Commissioner <PERSON>Mary Francis Berry</PERSON> said it was "another sad episode in the saga of the unguided missile who is chairman." Rep. <PERSON>Don Edwards</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Democrat, warned <PERSON>Mr. Allen</PERSON> that the speech would be "outside the scope of the commission's jurisdiction." <PERSON>Thomas Stoddard</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Lambda Legal Defense Fund</ORGANIZATION>, called the prospect of the speech "frankly shocking." 
<PERSON>Mr. Allen</PERSON> began it with a warning to his hosts, a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> church group that opposes rights for homosexuals.
<PERSON>Mr. Allen</PERSON>, who teaches government at prestigious <ORGANIZATION>Harvey Mudd College</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and will remain a member of the commission, has spent years arguing that civil rights are individuals' rights.
<PERSON>Mr. Allen</PERSON> quickly ran up against the liberal establishment again, which somehow elevated the vague concept of "Indian rights" above the rights of individual <ORGANIZATION>Indians</ORGANIZATION>. 
We hope the next head of the <ORGANIZATION>Civil Rights Commission</ORGANIZATION> will be as brave as <PERSON>Mr. Allen</PERSON> in making the case for equality of civil rights. 
The <ORGANIZATION>National Broadcasting Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION>, had its record-breaking 68-week reign as the prime-time ratings leader snapped yesterday by <ORGANIZATION>ABC-TV</ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Capital Cities/ABC Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
In the ratings compiled by the <ORGANIZATION>A.C. Nielsen Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>, which broadcast the World Series, topped the competition with a 14.8 rating and 25 share. 
<ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> was second with a 13.9 rating and 24 share followed by <ORGANIZATION>CBS Inc.</ORGANIZATION> 's television network with a 12.5 rating and 21 share. (A ratings point represents 904,000 television households; shares indicate the percentage of sets in use.) 
The first two games of the World Series between the <ORGANIZATION>Oakland Athletics</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco Giants</ORGANIZATION> didn't finish in the top 10; instead they landed in 16th and 18th place.
The highest-rated show continues to be <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s "Roseanne." <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> had five of the top 10 shows; <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> had four and <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> had one. 
<ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> officials said <PERSON>Gary N. Roberts</PERSON> was disciplined following the exchange's investigation of his trading in several commodities pits from July to November 1988.
The <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Mr. Roberts</PERSON> withheld from the market certain orders in cooperation with another trader, <PERSON>David Stein</PERSON>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> fined <PERSON>Mr. Roberts</PERSON> $15,000 and suspended his trading membership for three years.
<PERSON>Roberts</PERSON> and <PERSON>Stein</PERSON> couldn't be reached for comment.
Neither was among the 46 traders indicted last August in a federal investigation of traders at both the <ORGANIZATION>Merc</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Board of Trade</ORGANIZATION>. 
And a squad of influential former <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> aides employed by the Wall Street firm <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers</ORGANIZATION> came to the Capitol in a vain attempt to strip the provision.
This sum has been guarded jealously by appropriators anxious to offset spending elsewhere, and conservative <PERSON>Sen. Phil Gramm</PERSON> cast the fight as a populist stand against monied interests. "We are stewards here, not of the mortgage companies, but the taxpayers," said the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> Republican. 
Final approval -- on a 64-35 roll call -- was never in doubt, but the opposition drew an unusual mix of senators, including Republicans <PERSON>Jesse Helms</PERSON> and <PERSON>Warren Rudman</PERSON> and Democrats <PERSON>Bill Bradley</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Glenn</PERSON>. 
The decision to raise the ceiling on <ORGANIZATION>FHA</ORGANIZATION> home loans still faces strong opposition in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>.
The station is promised $1.8 billion within the $5.36 billion provided for research and development in the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>, and the nation's high-speed aerospace plane -- cut by the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> -- could receive as much as $60 million in new funds or transfers. 
Similarly, the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> agreed to add back $62 million to continue work on the advanced communications technology satellite, being developed by <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co</ORGANIZATION>.
An estimated $1.57 billion is separately allocated for the <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, and within the Housing and <ORGANIZATION>Urban Development Department</ORGANIZATION>, more than $9.2 billion is provided for federally assisted housing, including an expanded effort to modernize public housing units that serve the poorest families. 
The most striking example yesterday may have been in community development funds, where the two houses had separately approved a total of 27 projects valued at $20 million, and the conference added 15 more valued at $8 million to ostensibly preserve "balance" between the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. 
An exemption will remain for flights longer than six hours to <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, but estimates by the tobacco industry yesterday indicate all but about 30 flights would be covered. 
Separately, a third conference report covering an $18.4 billion <ORGANIZATION>Treasury and Postal Service</ORGANIZATION> bill was sent to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> after passing the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> on a 383-30 roll call yesterday.
And among domestic programs, the most serious threat is <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> opposition to abortion riders attached to separate bills funding the <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Department of Health and Human Services</ORGANIZATION>.
The same issue threatens to spill over to the foreign aid debate, and <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> also is threatening to veto any agreement that preserves Senate-passed provisions renewing <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> support for the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations Fund</ORGANIZATION> for Population Activities. 
In a sharply written letter, Rep. <PERSON>David Obey</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> appropriations subcommittee for foreign operations, warned <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> that the result of his "ultimatum" could weaken efforts to accommodate the administration elsewhere. "As a result of your ultimatum," writes the <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> Democrat, "I guess there is no longer any point in taking administration views into account on other items in conference, inasmuch regardless of their resolution you apparently intend to veto this bill." 
<ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>'S STOCK SKIDDED an additional $24.875, to $198, as <ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION> indicated it may balk at any hastily revised version of the aborted $6.79 billion buy-out of <ORGANIZATION>United Air</ORGANIZATION>'s parent.
Meanwhile, investor <PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON> said he remains interested in <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>, but he dropped his earlier $300-a-share back-up bid. 
<ORGANIZATION>Tele-Communications</ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy half of <ORGANIZATION>Showtime Networks</ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION>Viacom</ORGANIZATION> for $225 million.
<ORGANIZATION>FDIC</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Seidman</PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln Savings & Loan of California</ORGANIZATION> should have been seized in 1986 to contain losses he estimated will cost taxpayers as much as $2 billion. 
<ORGANIZATION>Hooker</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unit is expected to agree in principle this week to sell its <ORGANIZATION>Merksamer Jewelers</ORGANIZATION> chain to management, according to executives. 
The deficit-reduction bill became snagged over efforts to streamline the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> version of the legislation in advance of a <ORGANIZATION>House-Senate</ORGANIZATION> conference. 
<ORGANIZATION>Merck</ORGANIZATION>'s profit climbed 25%, <ORGANIZATION>Warner-Lambert</ORGANIZATION>'s 22% and <ORGANIZATION>Eli Lilly</ORGANIZATION>'s 24%. 
In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, shares of the <ORGANIZATION>Akron</ORGANIZATION>, Ohio-based company fell $1.375 to $49.125. 
<PERSON>Hudson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Goodwin</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> has repeatedly held that a judicial power to declare conduct to be against the public interest and hence criminal, while well established in <LOCATION>British</LOCATION> law, would usurp legislative authority under the doctrine of separation of powers. 
Prior to a tender offer by <ORGANIZATION>A&P for Waldbaum Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in 1986, the founder of the <PERSON>Waldbaum</PERSON>'s supermarket chain called an elderly relative to tell her to assemble her stock certificates for delivery.
Hearing of this information, the husband discussed it with his broker, <PERSON>Mr. Chestman</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Mr. Chestman</PERSON> then bought for his own account and other clients.
A second illustration is supplied by the recent guilty plea entered by <PERSON>Robert Freeman</PERSON>, formerly head of arbitrage at <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs & Co</ORGANIZATION>. Essentially, <PERSON>Mr. Freeman</PERSON> had invested heavily in the <ORGANIZATION>Beatrice</ORGANIZATION> leveraged buy-out, when he was told by another prominent trader, <PERSON>Bernard</PERSON> "Bunny" <PERSON>Lasker</PERSON>, that the deal was in trouble.
After placing orders to sell, <PERSON>Mr. Freeman</PERSON> called <PERSON>Martin Siegel</PERSON>, an investment banker at <ORGANIZATION>Kidder, Peabody & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, who was advising on the deal, to confirm these rumors.
<PERSON>Mr. Siegel</PERSON> asked <PERSON>Mr. Freeman</PERSON> who his source was and, on hearing that it was <PERSON>Bunny Lasker</PERSON>, responded: "Well, your bunny has a good nose." 
It is not my contention that either <PERSON>Mr. Chestman</PERSON> or <PERSON>Mr. Freeman</PERSON> was an innocent victim of prosecutorial overzealousness.
<PERSON>Mr. Coffee</PERSON> is a professor at <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Law School</ORGANIZATION>. 
The volatility was dizzying for traders. "The market must have turned up and down 15 different times," commented <PERSON>Lance Zipper</PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION>OTC</ORGANIZATION> trading at <ORGANIZATION>Kidder Peabody</ORGANIZATION>. "Every time you thought it was going into a rally it gave up, and every time you thought it would rally it came down.
The stock tumbled 2 3/4 on news that it might have to take a charge against earnings if it can't successfully resolve a dispute with its European licensee, <PERSON>Boehringer Mannheim</PERSON>, over its anti-anemia drug, <ORGANIZATION>EPO</ORGANIZATION>.
In a statement, <ORGANIZATION>Genetics Institute</ORGANIZATION> said the dispute with <PERSON>Boehringer</PERSON> centers on questions of the usability of certain batches of <ORGANIZATION>EPO</ORGANIZATION> material valued at $13.6 million.
The news couldn't have been better," said <PERSON>Linda Kristiansen</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Dean Witter Reynolds</ORGANIZATION> analyst, in an interview.
